1-> Foreign Notes
Kings and princes don't wear crowns to parties any more, but their wives some times do. When the Shah of Iran staged a four‐and ‐a‐half hour formal dinner last Thurs day to celebrate the 2,500th anniversary of the Persian monarchy, no fewer than 20 crowns and a dozen tiaras scintillated on the heads of royal ladies. The dinner highlighted a week of festivities in the grand tent city built in the desert to accommodate such luminaries as Soviet President Nikolai Podgomy, Emperor Haile Selassie, Vice President Agnew, Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito and Pakistan's President Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan. It began with a reception in a vast gold and scar let velvet hall especially built for the occasion near the site of Persepolis, capital of Cy tits the Great, founder of the Persian empire. Then came the meal itself in the blue and gold dining tent, catered by Maxim's of Paris and fea turing partridge with foie gras and truffle stuffing. The evening ended in a blaze of fireworks above the spectacular ruins of Persep olis. Before retiring, Haile Selassie, whose monarchy is even older than that of Per sia, went out on the lawn in his shirtsleeves and prayed.

2-> Adelphi Bows to Cortland; Officials Gain 254 Yards
CORTLAND, N.Y., Oct. 23—In a game marked by 254 yards in penalties on 26 infractions, Cortland State evened its won lost record at 3 and 3 by down ing Adelphi University, 23‐8, today. Cortland scored first when a defensive end, Jim Van Wormer, forced an Adelphi fumble that was recovered by a teammate, Bob Del Rosso, on the Adelphi 19‐yard line. It took the Drag ons four plays to get into the end zone, with Tom Blair going in from the I.

3-> ‘SYNDROME’ FOUND IN RETURNED G.I.'S
FORT BENNING, Ga.— —“Stogdill,” came the voice over the loudspeaker, “time to play pool.” Pfc. Alan Stogdill of Imogene, Iowa, and, more recently, of Carnranh, South Vietnam, got up laboriously from his arm chair in front of a color tele vision set in the enlisted men's club and started off to the pool table he had reserved. “I should have stayed over there,” he said, referring to Vietnam. “Since we got to Ben nine.” he added with unintended irony, “it's been just one detail after another.” Although Private Stogdill and a half‐dozen other Vietnam veterans who were gathered around the television set this afternoon did not appear to he suffering, some officers here said they were afflicted by what they called—for want of a better term—“Vietnam syndrome.” The symptoms are those that might be expected in any period of slackness after the kind of tension prevailing in a war zone. The men feel bored. They re sent the fact that after surviv ing a dangerous year in Viet nam they still have to put in some months of “Mickey Mouse” duty in the States. There is alienation at being separated from wartime bud dies and resentment over the indifferent welcome accorded them by their countrymen. For all these reasons there is a vague longing to return to Vietnam. “It's just a waste; we don't do anything,” complained Spe cialist 4 Harold Chapman of Buffalo, who returned to the United States last November after a year near Phan Thiet as an infantryman. A draftee, he will finish his two‐year military obligation here this August. Specialist Chapman, who said he had been wounded in the arm by a “Chicom” (Chinese Communist) hand grenade, was recently arrested in Columbus, Ga., on drug charges. His trial is still pending. He has also been a periodic visitor to the base hospital's mental hygiene unit. “I tell them I've had flash hacks, had dreams and that,” he said. “I have had a couple.” In the sense that the syn civome is a collection of symp toms, “we definitely have a syndrome,” said Capt. Gene C. Wilkinson of Petersburg, Va., a social worker attached to the Martin Army Hospital's mental hygiene office. He and other officers who counsel the afflicted soldiers agree that the syndrome is not a clear diagnostic category, but a combination of effects at least partially attributable to Vietnam duty. Maj. Steve Weinstein, a psy chiatrist at the hospital who probably sees more Vietnam veterans than any other doctor here, is unwilling even to go that far with any certainty. He says that the men he sees ex hibit effects of a traumatic change of venue not necessarily exclusive in the case of Viet nam. Still, the syndrome here is identifiable enough for officers to understand and exchange knowing glances when a sol dier's misbehavior is ascribed to “returnee's syndrome.” Except in rare diagnosed cases of acute psychosis, when full psychiatric treatment is necessary, treatment for the syndrome consists of talks be tween the victim and members of the mental hygiene staff. “It used to be a terrible prob lem,” said Col. Willard Latham, commander of the 197th In fantry Brigade. “The main prob lem was a lack of community feeling,” the colonel added. It was one of Colonel Latham's chaplains, Maj. David Hoh, who is credited with coining the term “Vietnam syndrome” last year. In January, 1970, Colonel Latham's charts show that the 197th had what he acknowl edged was the highest A.W.O.L rate in the Army. At one point the brigade, which, with 6,000 men, is the largest in the Army, had about 150 men per 1,000 absent without leave. Drunken ness, crime and incidents of violence also testified to the morale problems. Since then, the colonel said, he has augmented his orienta tion program for returning veterans, who make up about 85 per cent of his brigade. The A.W.O.L. rate now stands at about 12 per 1,000 and inci dents of racial fights, crime, alcoholism and drug abuse are declining significantly, the colo nel said. Still, the hygiene unit has seen no particular decline in the number of syndrome cases. Officers decline to estimate the over‐all number because of the vagueness of the term. A small number of soldiers interviewed at random on this sprawling infantry base singled out for condemnation their assignment as enemy guerril las” in training games for Army Rangers at their base in Florida. In the past 11 months, one officer at the mental hygiene clinic said, about 50 soldiers have come to the clinic with complaints that the war games were recreating till, horrors they experienced in Vietnam.

4-> At 9:20 A.M. Class Dined on Paella
HARTSDALE, N.Y. — It was only 9:20 in the morn ing, but the seven boys were really digging into the pael la, shrimp and crab poulette, and turkey‐asparagus casse role. They had just prepared the dishes in the home economics laboratory of the Woodlands High School here, and now was the time to test their culinary talents. “How do you eat this— with a fork or a spoon?” asked 16‐year‐old William Robinson as he turned to the shrimp and crab concoction he had made. He and the other six teen agers, mainly juniors and seniors, are members of the new home economics class for boys that meets five days a week for 43 minutes. An elective course that was in augurated in response to stu dent requests, it will have two sections of 10 stu dents each next September. Besides cooking, the boys have studied food and nutri tion, sewing, the care and use of fabrics; consumer top ics, child development, and home and family life. “I don't want to do so much about cooking,” said Arnold Coleman, a senior, as he stirred the paella, “but I've got the hang of sewing, and I'm going to make my own clothes.” Each student has already made a dashiki. “Hope you didn't put too much Parmesan cheese on that casserole,” Harris Gher sin said as he hopped on one leg to help Donald Stiehl complete the asparagus and turkey casserole. Harris was excused fromclean‐up chores because he had bruised his foot in a fall from a ladder. In another corner of the kitchen area Steven Schlussel was kneading bread to be baked the next day. He was joined by 17‐year‐old Ned Le vine, who had to tie his long hair back with an elastic band before plunging his hands into the dough. Steven and Ned arc experts on bread‐making. Last summer they had baked for private orders. “You're going to ruin my chicken,” Arnold Coleman said as Mrs. Margaret Dug gan, chairman of the depart ment, tipped a can of clamsin‐the‐shell into the paella. “We try to encourage the boys to widen their horizons beyond the hamburger spe cial,” explained Mrs. Patsy Gillespie, the class instructor. The most ambitious class project was catering a school administrators' banquet for 35. Harris Ghersin did the apple pie while Steve and Ned made the fresh rolls. The other boys helped to make a turkey divan casserole, beef Burgundy and a Chinese beef and rice dish. “You know that shrimp's pretty good,” William Coram said as he took a second helping. Arnold Coleman fished a piece of chicken out of the paella. “Came out bet ter than I thought it would, I guess,” he said. The boys also attend lec tureson consumer topics They will study the pitfalls of buy ing a car, learn how to shop for the best buy, and how to arrange financing and in surance.

5-> Countering Rising Mail Costs
In Richmond, the Virginia Electric and Power Company is delivering monthly bills to its 90,000 customers by hand and plans to expand this service to other urban areas in the state by the middle of next month. In Hollywood, Fla., the Pri vate Postal System of Amer ica is winning new clients for the distribution of samples and advertising materials by offering rates well below those associated with third class mail. In Des Moines, Iowa, the Meredith Corporation is pri vately shipping its Better Homes & Gardens magazines to 55 major cities in the United States before turning them over to local post of flees and thereby eliminating approximately 35 per cent of the cost of mailing from the plant. And in Westfield, N.J., the Suburban News, a weekly shopper newspaper, started using carrier boys for deliv ery in order to prevent a substantial advertising rate increase as a result of higher postage charges. All of these cases indicate the extent to which business users of the mails turned to alternative methods as postal costs have increased. With a $1.45‐billion temporary post al rise now in effect and other permanent increases be ing proposed, such alterna tives are attracting still more companies. Eleven days ago, the Post al Rate Commission, a regu latory commission established under the same Postal Re organization Act of 1970 that created the United States Postal Service on July 1— completed 20 weeks of hear ings on the proposed perma nent rates. About 100 “in tervenors” offered more than 12,000 pages of testimony and 250 exhibits in an ef fort to convince the hearing examiner, Seymour J. Wen ner, who is expected to hand down an initial decision next month. The Postal Service wants a 142 per cent increase in second‐class mail for maga zines and newspapers over a five‐year period, a phased in rise of about one‐third for third‐class bulk mail and ad vertising matter and an even tual doubling of the rate of fourth‐class parcel post. “The increases represent a step to ward the goal of charging users of postal services in proportion to their use and reducing the burden of the general taxpayer,” according to Postmaster General Win ston M. Blount. Corporations — individually and through their trade as sociations—that make exten sive use of the mails do not quite see it that way. From the Magazine Publishers As sociation to the Direct Mail Advertising Association— which only last week filed suit to prevent the Postal Service from raising the third‐class bulk rate to 5 cents a unit—to the Asso ciated Third Class Mail Users, the protests have been long, loud and lingering. For example, Edward Sha fer, vice president of Foster Associates, a consulting firm hired by the M.P.A., said that 42 leading magazines had a total operating profit of $32‐ million in 1970. “If maga zines had attempted to ab sorb the full postal increase, they would have experienced an operatipg loss of more than $59‐million,” he added. The D.M.A.A.—whose mem bers were saved an immedi ate increase in September to the highest third‐class rate allowable by President Nix on's wage‐price freeze—is equally agitated. As David Reichberg, executive vice president of the advertising agency of Altman, Vos, and Reichberg, noted, “If the cost of third‐class bulk mail goes higher and the differential between free‐standing stuf fers (circulars inserted loose in newspapers) and third class direct mail becomes greater, even more money will be shifted into free standing stuff ers.” Speaking for the third class users a ssocati on, Charles W. King of the eco nomic consulting firm of Snavely, King & Tucker ob served, “The rate increase for bulk third‐class mail as proposed by the Postal Service is grossly excessive and unjustified. The criterion of demand elasticity suggests that any rate increase for bulk‐rate third‐class mail could result in a net revenue loss for the Postal Service.” Protests like these might be considered hyperbole if there were not widescale situations already of deleteri ous effects on major mail users from postage increases. In the magazine field Look went out of business with a blast at “dramatically” high postal rates, McCalls and Es quire have reduced their size to lower mailing costs and the Atlantic Monthly and the revived Saturday Evening Post both charge more for subscriptions than the cover price on newsstands. Other instances abound in direct marketing. Many dis tribution executives report that “junk mail” is on the decline. Charitable Institu tions like New York's Indus trial Home for the Blind no longer provide contributors with stamped return enve lopes. Any number of list owners and renters in the di rect response field have de veloped new computerized and demographical tech niques for weeding out mail ing lists to make them more effective. Take the question of first class mail. A company that wants to use outside carriers to deliver its letters must nevertheless place the cor rect amount or first‐class postage on the envelope, cancel the stamps and write the date of transmission alongside, under the provi sions of Section 901 of the postal statute. So, forward looking corporations have turned to other methods of delivery. And by whatever means large mail users can reach their target audiences for less money, steps are being taken. The temporary rate increases that went into ef fect on May 16 were not the first in recent years—and will not be the last. Early this month the Postal Serv ice said that another increase would be in the offing next spring—so that many busi nesses have been on the look out for cost‐saving devices for some time. At Virginia Electric, plan ning for its door‐to‐door bill delivering system began on May 17 when first‐class rates into effect with a pilot group of 30,000 homes. The other 60,000 customers in Rich mond were added recently. The metropolitan areas of Tidewater, northern Virginia and other sections of its ter ritory will add 360,000 homes to this program. T. Justin Moore Jr., presi dent of the utility, said that it spent between 4 and 5 cents a bill for hand delivery, compared with the 8‐cent cost of a postage stamp. “Our cost studies show that we went up 2 cents. By July, the system was ready to go could save approximately $200,000 a year if we went to a program of hand de– livering bills in the highly populated areas,” he said. Private mail companies— which generally have lower overhead costs, than local of fices of the Postal Service— report that their volume rises whenever the Government's postal system increases rates. In addition to P.P.S.A., the Independent Postal System of America, the Continental Postal Service and the Amer ican Postal Corporation also serve densely populated areas with the equivalent of third‐class mail. “The Gov ernment is going to be left with just the rural areas and no chance to even out,” be lieves one expert in this field. “If you compare our total elivered price with the cost of direct‐mail postage and other cost requirements, we end up between 25 and 50 per cent cheaper,” claited Larry L. Van Dusseldorp Sr., president of the Private Postal Systems of America. Mr. Van Dusseldorp's tabu lation shows his charges as 5 cents‐a‐unit (delivered un addressed in a plastic bag on the doorknob because pri vate carriers are not permit ted by Federal law to Use householders’ mailboxes) or 4 cents‐a‐unit on a weekly ba sis. In contrast, he estimates the over‐all direct‐mail unit cost as 8.2 cents‐4 cents for the basic postage, 1.2 cents for addressing, 1.5 cents for the envelope, 1 cent for the mailing service and a half‐cent for list mainte nance or rental. When it comes to second class mail, the postage rates “are based on the publica tion's weight, its percentage of advertising and the dis tance it travels. For cost conscious publishers, the third factor offers the great est opportunities to save money. So Meredith, with a mail circulation of about 7 mil lion, sends its magazines by truck or rail to entry, points in or outside of large cities where it has, extensive dis tribution. The magazines — sorted by zip code and packed in bundles on the ba sis of sectional centers—are thereby also better protected from the hazards of multiple sorting along the road. W. E. Ritchie, Meredith's, corporate director of traffic, noted that a recent one‐ pound issue mailed at Jersey City cost 5.16 cents a copy for postage (plus 1.25 cents for freight to that city) but would have cost 10.04 cents a‐copy if mailed to Jersey City from Des Moines. Simi larly, this issue's mailing cost was 5.18 cents a copy in Oakland, Calif. (plus 1.50 cents for freight) and would have cost 10.67 cents if mailed to the West Coast from the publication site. At the time that it “went carrier” a couple of years ago, Westfield's Suburban News was mailing 35,000 copies a week to homes in eight Union County, N. J., towns. Then a postal rate in crease was put into effect, so Russell L. Wyckoff, the publisher, decided to hire about 300 carriers. “Our advertising rate was then $2.85 an inch,” he re called. “I would have had to raise it 25 cents an inch to continue mailing the papers.” One of the 26 members of Community Newspapers of New Jersey—one‐third of which have converted to car rier delivery—the Suburban News has realized other ben efits from this changeover. Circulation has increased by around 5,000 and deliveries all take place now on the same day, rather than hav ing copies reach readers at different times depending upon the vagaries of the local post offices. Forty years ago, the late comedian Fred Allen said, “The department stores will soon be using a discus thrower to hurl packages to out‐of‐town mail‐order cus tomers.” Perhaps that idea is not as far‐fetched today.

To the Financial Editor: I have been thinking over your article on the hard pressed private club (Sept. 26). To me, it's an alarming situation. Not because of the pressure on my clubs, or anyone else's, but because of the ominous implications for our liberty. When The Times was locked in mortal combat with the Government over the Pentagon Papers, it should have been apparent to you that the very govern ment you have built to such power had finally turned on its creator. The Times has consistently promoted ex pansion of the central gov ernment to attain social and economic goals. Yet it seems clear that you were stunned when this power was turned on the press. “The natural process of things,” wrote Thomas Jef ferson, “is for liberty to yield and government to gain power.” The pressure of govern ment against private clubs is akin to pressure on C.B.S.

7-> Problems Are Depicted
DALLAS, April 30 — “They don't wine and dine em like they used to,” drawled a Ling Temco‐Vought Inc., shareholder at the company's annual stock holders meeting here today. “No, and it's just as well?” snapped another. That summed up the feelings of many of the stockholders at the meeting as they heard Paul Thayer, chairman and president of Ling‐Temco‐Vought, Inc., say he was “personally delighted to see 1970 disappear over the horizon.” “If I had to sum up the basic objective of L‐T‐V in the year 1970, in all candor I would have to say the word spelled survival. In looking back I can say that the survival was not only an objective but was also an accomplishment,” Mr. Thayer said. Outlining the problems of 1970, Mr. Thayer told the 100 stockholders at the meeting that L‐T‐V's rise during the last six years might have been too fast. Difficulties arising from internally created prob lems as well as external hin drances resulted in last sum mer's management and board of director changes, he said. Low earnings performance by most subsidiaries coupled with unacceptably high debt service requirements resulted in a negative cash flow, Mr. Thayer said. Additionally, the antitrust lawsuit and settlement in the Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation acquisition severely limited L‐T‐V in coping with the debt undertaken to finance the growth, he said. L‐T‐V's deficit in 1970 was $69,619,000, up from $38,294, 000 the year before. Mr. Thayer said that first‐ quarter results this year were optimistic but that he could not give stockholders a well‐de fined answer about L‐T‐V's future. Earlier this week, L‐T‐V re ported that it had earnings in the first period of $1,889, 000 before extraordinary items, which was equal to 18 cents a share. This compares with a loss of $9,313,000 before an extraordinary charge and $15, 345,000 after the charge in the year‐earlier quarter. The planned sale of the Oko nite Company to James Ling's Omega‐Alpha, Inc., brought a challenge from a Cincinnati at torney, Gene Mesh, who identi fied himself as a proxy repre sentative for a holder of 100 shares of L‐T‐V stock. Mr. Ling is the founder of L‐T‐V. Mr. Mesh, who said that he had a lawsuit pending against L‐T‐V, declared that he was “requesting the board to recon sider that sale.” “Full negotiations were not made with other offerors,” Mr. Mesh charged. “The person buying knew he was getting it for a low price. You have an opportunity to sweeten the deal or back down.” Mr. Mesh also called the Okonite sale “an incestuous one.” Mr. Thayer replied that he was not aware of what Mr. Mesh's valuations were con cerning Okonite, but he con sidered the $40‐million offer from Omega‐Alpha acceptable. “They've been trying to sell Okonite since I came on the scene. I don't think it is an in cestnous one. We have worked at arm's length with Mr. Ling,” Mr. Thayer said. He also said that 170 com panies had contacted L‐T‐V re garding the Okonite offer and that about 30 had made serious or semiserious offers. He added that financial arrangements did not congeal for those offerors. Mr. Thayer added that the Justice Department was sat isfied with the Okonite ar rangements and told Mr. Mesh, Your case is without merit,” Mr. Mesh answered from the floor that L‐T‐V was “cleaning its skirts” now and added that he Okonite contract was tainted.

8-> AMTRAK CHUGS IN WITH FEW ABOARD
The National Railroad Pas senger Corporation, known as Amtrak, took over the rem nants of the nation's long‐neg lected, deficit‐ridden intercity passenger railroads yesterday with little evident confusion, customarily low patronage and a number of whistle‐stop cere monies. The semi‐nationalization of the passenger rails, achieved after months of debate and challenges in Congress and the Federal courts, was ushered in without fanfare or trouble in most cities. For thousands of railroad workers, the transition will mean a loss of jobs in months ahead. While the new system will run 182 trains touching more than 300 cities, a total of 178 passenger trains, many of them famed names of Amer canai were dropped. Many of these trains made their last runs yesterday, some in the glory of nostalgic cham pagne farewells, others in the ignominy of defeat. The Man hattan Limited broke down on its final run from Chicago to New York, and a New England train hit a truck. Many riders on final runs were people who had not been aboard a train for years, or children whose parents did not want them to miss a ride on one of the fading relics of America's railroading past. Amid the backward looks, however, there were expres sions of hope. In New York, Secretary of Transportation John A. Volpe led an inaugural ceremony by declaring that Amtrak would begin “a new era in intercity railroad passen ger service.” At a news conference in Penn Station, where he stepped off a shiny new Metroliner from Washington, Mr. Volpe predicted that the nation's pas senger lines would “compete directly and aggressively” with airlines, buses and automobiles, and indicated how this might be done. “The traveling public is en titled to clean passenger cars, to on‐time schedules, to ap petizing meals and prompt service and to long‐neglected practices of service and civility,” he said. “All of these amenities can and in time will be restored to rail operations.” Mr. Volpe said that Amtrak, a corporation created by Con gress last October with a $40‐ million grant and loan pledges of up to $300‐million, would begin to break even financial ly in about three years. He said the public should not expect a “sudden and mi raculous” transformation, and asked for patience while Am trak “restores, rebuilds and revitalizes” the passenger lines. Commuter service will not be affected by the plan. Roger Lewis, president of Amtrak, said the corporation would be “innovative and pro motional, selling hard and do ing everything we can to at tract passengers.” Mr. Volpe and Mr. Lewis repeated their messages in Metroliner stops at Newark, Trenton, Philadelphia, Wilming ton and Baltimore on their way back to Washington. In Chicago, Mayor Richard J. Daley dispatched Amtrak's first train out of Union Sta tion, the “Empire Builder,” to Seattle—on time. In many cities, most nota bly in Cleveland, passenger service was abandoned alto gether. The last train pulled out of Cleveland's Union Ter minal at 1:15 P.M. and the Penn Central closed its ticket office. The. Amtrak directors are to meet Tuesday to consider a plan to run one train a day through Cleveland, on a New York‐to‐Chicago run, Five states—Ohio, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and Michi gan—have pledged to pool re sources to cover two‐thirds of any losses incurred by the service. In some areas, particularly along the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston, Am trak plans an early expansion of service. Two additional Metroliners were added yesterday to the seven runs between New York and Washington. As a sign of things to come, the train that carried the Amtrak dignitaries and newsmen featured stew ardesses in red blazers and blue slacks, passenger repre sentatives, carpeting and com fortable seats. Amtrak officials are develop ing plans to improve the rail roads' reservation systems, tick eting procedures, baggage han dling, food service, advertising and marketing, and accommo dations. Eventually, there may be live entertainment, movies, beauty parlors and barber shops, lounges and offices for businessmen aboard the trains. Critics of Amtrak contend that it will not he able to at tract patronage from the major competitors — speedy airlines over long distances and eco nomic convenient automobiles over shorter routes. In addition, critics note that the corporation will be saddled with the same union work rules and pay scales that have forced the private carriers into mount ing deficits over the years. But Amtrak officials and their supporters insist that the growing congestion of high ways and airways will turn more riders to trains, especially if they are made faster and more attractive and reliable. Supporters note, too, that for the first time in decades the passenger railroads are being run by an organization com mitted to improvements and public service. “Success will depend on the American people and how they respond,” Mr. Volpe said. “They will be our boss.”

9-> Goldwater Calls Campaign By McCloskey ‘Insignificant’
MOUNT FREEDOM, N. J., June 6 (AP) — Senator Barry Goldwater, Republican of Ari zona, dismissed the Presidential drive of Representative Paul N. McCloskey Jr. as “insignificant” today. “McCloskey stands a good chance not even getting re elected to Congress,” Mr. Gold water said. Mr. McCloskey, a Republican from California, has announced that he will oppose President Nixon for the party nomination in 1972 if Mr. Nixon does not withdraw all troops from com bat areas in Indochina. Senator Goldwater said he thought Senator Henry M. Jack son of Washington was “per haps the best man the Demo crats have and probably one of the best in the country.” Mr. Goldwater made his remarks after a commencement address at the Gen. Douglas MacArthur Military Academy here.

10-> Sports of The Times
John Riggins, the New York Jets' running back, soared above a pile of linemen toward the goal line. Touchdown or not? John Gilliam, a wide receiver for the St. Louis Cardinals, tip‐toed along the sideline with a pass. In bounds or out? These two plays occurred in last Monday night's nationally televised National Football League game. The officials ruled on them immediately. No touchdown. In bounds. The rulings probably were correct. But in this electronic age, is “probably” enough? Shouldn't there be a TV monitor, manned by a league official, to prevent obvious human error before the game resumes. Not that such a TV monitor would be used indiscriminately on every controversial play. Usually the faraway TV camera would be less reliable than the official a few feet from the play. But the important word is “obvious” human error. Occasionally an N.F.L. game official makes an obvious mistake —as one did a year ago when the New York Giants were deprived of a touchdown. Aaron Thomas was ruled out‐ofbounds when he caught a pass at New Orleans clearly inside the end zone. Occasionally a baseball umpire is out position—as a plate umpire, Ken Burkhart, was in last year's World Series when he had his back to the play on which he ruled Bernie Carbo of the Cincinnati Reds be out although the Baltimore Orioles' catcher, Elrod Hendricks, never tagged him. Burkhart lucked out. Carbo had missed the plate in his slide. The TV monitor also would be useful in basketball, hockey and tennis, as cameras have been in racing, track and field, and swimming. “Beginning with the photo‐finish to the videotape we now have,” says Jimmy Jones, the Monmouth Park director of racing, “the camera has done more for public confidence in racing than anything else. The human eye doesn't always see the same thing as a camera does. Things happen too fast sometimes.” Jones recalled a 1949 stakes race at Santa Anita when Citation and Noor pounded across the finish line together. “Everybody on the finish line thought that Citation won it,” Jones said, “but the photo showed he got beat an inch. Now, with videotape, the public sees why a foul claim is upheld. No reason why they can't do it in other sports. It doesn't take any power away from football officials or baseball umpires. It enables them to make the correct decision and that's the name of the game.” In football, the ideal would be cameras focused each sideline, each goal line, each end line. “I think it might happen someday,” says Mark Duncan, the overseer of N.F.L. game officials. “But you've got to be very careful about a game becoming too mechanical. Once you start tampering with the human element, you're trouble. The problem now is that there's not much depth perception on a TV screen. In a baseball game, you can't always tell if a ball is going out to center field or if it's a high foul behind the plate. And in football, especially on a goal‐line pile‐up, the ball often is hidden from the TV camera.” Duncan mentioned that his 84 officials, as a group, don't resent TV slow‐motion instant replay checking their judgment. “Ninety‐nine per cent of the time,” Duncan says, “the TV camera shows that they made the correct decision on the call.” Which might be the first time that Duncan or any member of Commissioner Pete Rozelle's staff acknowledged that “one per cent of the time” the officials might have made an honest mistake. But at the baseball commissioner's office, Joe Reichler, its director of public relations, provided more resistance. “If you did use a TV monitor,” Reichler asked, “where do you stop? Pretty soon, you'd have everybody wanting a mechanical device to determine balls and strikes. And their argument would be, why is one decision more important than another?” Control and discretion would be vital. But no more vital than a play that decides the Super Bowl or the World Series.

HOLLYWOOD, June 6 (AP)— Van Heflin, the stage and screen actor, was taken to a hospital in critical condition today after suffering a heart attack while swimming. Firemen said they could feel no pulse on the 60‐year‐old Mr. Heflin for the 12 minutes it took them to reach the hospital. A gardener had pulled Mr. Heflin from a ladder in friend's swimming pool, his head barely above water. Firemen tried unsuccessfully to revive Mr. Heflin on the way to Hollywood Emergency Hos pital, where officials reported only that he was “still alive.” He was transferred to nearby Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, where a spokesman said he was in critical condition. Mr. Heflin, who has been familiar face in films and on Broadway for nearly 40 years, is in the current movie “Air port.”

13-> Five Black American Catholics Will Take Grievances to Pope
Five black Roman Catholics —a priest, a nun and three lay persons—plan to leave tonight for Rome to discuss with Pope Paul VI what they describe as the “disastrously poor” relationship of the church in this country to black Americans. They will also propose that a black priest be named Archbishop of Washington to succeed Patrick Cardinal O'Boyle, who recently submitted his resignation to the Vatican. Their plans were announced yesterday at a news conference in the Roman Catholic Church of the Resurrection at 276 West 151st Street. Heading the delegation will be the Rev. Lawrence E. Lucas, pastor of the Harlem church and president of the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus. He said he was “confident” of getting the papal audiences, for which arrangements are being made by Brother Joseph Davis of the National Office for Black Catholics, who is now in Rome. Other members are Sister Martin dePorres Grey, president of the National Conference of Black Sisters; Joseph Dunn. president of the National Black Lay Catholic Caucus; Charles Hammock, executive director of the lay group, and Estelle Collins of the Baltimore Black Catholic Caucus. The delegation will arrive in Rome four days after the opening of the month‐long Synod of Bishops, called by Pope Paul, which is expected to discuss the crisis in the priesthood and the role of the church in social change. Father Lucas, speaking on be half of the delegation at the news conference, said that the church “functions as just another institution in American society and is basically white andl racist.” “It has deserted the priorities of the Gospels and adopted those of the American majority,” he declared. The white American hierarchy, according to the priest, is “still insistent on dealing with black Catholics as bastard children and with the black community in a dishonest, racist and superficial manner.” Father Lucas estimated that there were 800,000 black Roman Catholics in the United States out of a total Catholic population of about 48 million. He said there were 160 black priests out of a total of 57,000.

14-> RHEFFIC TRIUMPHS IN $366,830 RACE
PARIS, June 6 — The re nowned French trainer, Fran cois Mathet, saddled his fourth French Derby winner in six years today as Mrs. Francois Dupre's bay colt, Rheffic, cap tured the 130th running of the Chantilly Classic. With a total prize money of $366,830 — the winner's purse was $216,530 — the Prix du Jockey Club, or French Der by, is the richest race for 3‐ year‐olds in the world. Bill Pyers of Australia urged Rheffic into the lead in the last furlong of the mile‐and‐a half race to win by a length from Mrs. Leon Volterra's Nym bio, who barely beat the 6‐4 favorite, Tarbes, by a neck for second place. The winning time was 2:32 on perfect going be neath an overcast sky at the Hippodrome Des Conde. Second place was worth $64,800 and third place $32, 400. Mrs. Dupre also earned $22,680 as the breeder of the winner. Rheffic, by the American stal lion Traffic out of Rhenane, paid the equivalent of $23 for $2 to win and $6.60 to show. Nym bio paid $7.70 and Tarbes $3 to show. An American challenger, Pink Dust, a 38‐1 outsider, fin ished as an also‐ran. The 14 horses broke alertly from the starting gate for the race over the button‐hook shaped course, which presents a succession of contrasting ups and downs. One entry, Countess Magit Batthyany's Basileus, a French colt, was withdrawn. Leading Man, piloted by Les tor Piggott, made the early run ning, tracked by Hagen. Rhef fic stayed along the rail about fifth or sixth. Tarbes, ridden by Yann Josse, was last. Going downhill into the first turn, Leading Man and Hagen were still in front. Tarbes start ed to make up ground as the horses began the tough climb into the final turn. In the straight, with the ground still rising for two fur longs, Tarbes made up more than 10 lengths racing on the outside, but the effort was too much. As Tarbes joined the leaders in the final furlong, Rheffic surged ahead to win. A crowd of 30,000 watched at this thoroughbred training center 20 miles from Paris, in cluding the cream of French society. The gentlemen of the Jockey Club, in morning coats and high hats, were out in force. Their ladies were segregated according to custom in a sep arate section of the grandstand, as if they had never heard of women's lib. The victory by Rheffic was a personal triumph for Mathet, a straight‐backed former cav alry officer and champion gen tleman rider. Mathet horses have finished in the money nine times in the French Derby. But, in spite of the success of Sassafras in the Derby last year and his defeat of Nijin sky in the Arc, there were ru mors that the Mathet stable was declining. Mathet broke with his champion jockey, Yves Saint Martin, who had ridden for him for more than 10 years. And Mrs. Dupre gave a string of her fillies to an unknown young trainer. But today for Mathet at Chantilly, it was “Bien fait” (Well done) the highest words of praise the stern master has been known to utter to jockey or horse.

16-> Former Bus Company Official Testifies on Payment to Cohn
A former official of the Fifth Avenue Coach Lines testified yesterday that the bus company had paid $300,000 to Roy M. Cohn to enable him to repay money he had borrowed from, the company's top officials. Mr. Cohn went on trial Monday in Federal Court here on charges that he had made false statements by concealing that he used the money from Fifth Avenue Coach to pay back the officials of the bus company in 1966 when he was the company's general counsel. The prosecution contended that Mr. Cohn had diverted the company's money for his own use, then concealed it in an annual report and proxy statements to the company's stockholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The defense responded that Mr. Cohn had received the money as a legal fee for a $55‐million condemnation case he had conducted for the cornpany and that it was a properly reported fee that he could use as he saw fit. Federal regulations require the disclosure of any material interest that the official of a public company might have in funds disbursed by the company. Yesterday's witness was Edward Krock, a Massachusetts financier, who was treasurer of Fifth Avenue Coach when he and Victor Muscat, who was the company's president, provided a loan of $450,000 that helped Mr. Cohn invest in a complex of Muscat‐Krock corporations that included the bus company. The witness testified for the prosecution that Fifth Avenue Coach had made a $300,000 payment to Mr. Cohn in 1966 as an advance on his legal fees so that he could complete the repayment of the money he had borrowed from the company's officials. Testifying in a low, indistinct voice, the gray‐haired witness admitted that he had lied to a grand jury in 1967 when he denied that he had received any part of the $300,000 payment that Mr. Cohn had obtained from the company. Thomas H. Coghill, the prosecutor, elicited from the witness that he was fined $22,500 and placed on probation for five years after he, pleaded guilty in 1969 to charges that he had filed false statements with the S.E.C. Mr. Cohn's law partner and defense lawyer, Thomas A. Bolan, opened the cross‐examination by establishing that the financier had admitted lying many times to the grand jury but that he had not been indicted for perjury. “When did you stop lying?” the defense lawyer asked. “Mr. Bolan,” the witness replied, “when I was lying it was to protect your partner and Mr. Muscat.” Seeking to discredit the Krock testimony that Fifth Avenue Coach had made the $300,000 payment to Mr. Cohn as a means of repaying money to the company officials, Mr. Bolan read testimony that the witness had given in a separate case earlier this year. The defense lawyer stressed that the earlier Krock testimony included a vehement denial that money paid to the Cohn law firm by various Muscat‐Krock companies had been a vehicle to repay the loan. The cross‐examination is scheduled to continue when the trial is resumed by Judge Charles H. Tenney on Monday at 10:30 A.M.

18-> Transcript Errors Cited in Plea To Dismiss a Police Graft Trial
The lawyer for a police lieu tenant who told a grand jury that he had received $200 a month to protect gamblers asked yesterday that Police De partment charges against him be dismissed on the ground that the transcript of the officer's grand jury testimony was in accurate. The motion was made in the departmental trial of Lieut. Francis X. Ward on a charge that he made “evasive and in consistent statements” to Manhattan grand jury and to police investigators about his association with gamblers. He also is charged by the department with receiving “sums of money in furtherance of the protection of gambling operations within the city of New York.” Benjamin Ward, deputy po lice commissioner for trials, denied the motion of Lieutenant Ward's lawyer and reserved his decision in the case, but the argument could be used again if the case went to the courts. The lawyer, Richard D. Fried man, requested the dismissal after a stenographer assigned to the Manhattan grand jury admitted that a 20‐page trans cript he had prepared contained about 10 errors. Under cross‐examination by Mr. Friedman, the stenographer, Richard Glen, said a compari son of his stenographic notes and the transcript he had pre Ipared from them showed in stances where “faintest” had been transcribed as “vaguest,” “equipment” as “devices,” “in the Bronx” as “in the morn ing,” “Do you remember?” as “Huh?” and where one brief question and answer were not transcribed at all. Lieutenant Ward's depart‐, mental trial is scheduled to re sume May 10. The criminal charges against him were dis missed in February by State Supreme Court Justice Gerald P. Culkin and are now being appealed by the office of the, Manhattan District Attorney.

20-> Letter to the Editor 7 — No Title
To THE EDITOR: David French's article at last brings us a confession of a supposedly intellectual young person that all is not going well with the lives and goals of his generation. What I resent is that he and his col leagues keep insisting that they were channeled into this abysmal squalor because they are convinced that their par ents had lived worthless lives, had ruined our society, and they would do better. I am 60 years old and my husband and I are depicted as tired, sated old characters with nothing else to do but while away our hours in front of a television set. We lived more than half our lives before we even had a set. We were so busy earning a living, raising a family and making ends meet with no public grants or parental handouts for our own indulgence. Yet in those trying times we rid our country of child labor, arranged for fair labor prac tices, social security, pen sions, leisure time and a fair amount of financial independ ence for working people. We are still concerned with today's problems, and I'm sure we would have gone on to work for the advancement of the poor and the blacks if the younger generation hadn't relegated us to the ash can while they took over these re sponsibilities. What a mess they have made of these proj ects and themselves! E. G. Brooklyn.

21-> Ridley Beats St. Andrew's by Length After 7‐Hour Delay in School Rowing
LIVERPOOL, N.Y., May 22 — Lake Onondaga's choppy waters, creating three ‐ foot swells near the head of the mile course, caused a seven hour interruption today in the 37th annual national schoolboy rowing championships. The program's resumption shortly before dusk was mark ed by an impressive victory by Ridley College's senior eight in the day's finale. The boarding school combination from St. Catharines, Ontario, gaining its third straight title in the event, defeated St. Andrew's of Mid dletown, Del., by a length. The winning time was 5 minutes 8 seconds. Gusts attaining. 15 miles an hour and quartering over the port bows were instrumental in causing delays during this morning's phases of the compe tition. But just before noon, when the senior quad shells found it difficult to make satis factory connections with the stake boats, the postponement was announced. Today's program, finished in light breezes that quartered from the starboard side, ended a two‐day rowing carnival in which more than 400 school boys from more than 40 Cana dian and Ainerican schools com peted. Eleven championship events comprised the final ses sion. In defeating St. Andrew's in the finale—the Delaware school also finished second last year — oarsmen displayed superb coordination. They gained the lead early and went up to a 38‐stroke‐per‐minute beat without difficulty near the finish to stave off a St. An drew's threat. Two events earlier, in the senior quads sculls, Washing ton‐Lee High of Arlington, Va., was named the winner after Haverford (Pa.) High was dis qualified and placed last in the five‐shell event. The Pennsylvanians, who showed lots of power, were eliminated after moving into the Virginians' lane setting up a traffic block that caused Wash ington‐Lee to stop stroking for several moments. The Virginian quartet was timed in 6:07. Early in the day, the Blessed Sacrament High School pair of Angelo Bergamini (bow) and Daniel Rooney (stroke), from New Rochelle, won the senior double sculls crown from the Haverford (Pa.) duo in a tingler. Bergamini and Rooney fin ished with a rush, rallying to pass Russ Janson and Terry Ferguson in the Haverford shell in the closing strokes. The win ning clocking for the mile was 7:35.4. Only a foot separated the first two boats at the finish. Indeed, the outcome was so close that the Blessed Sacra ment pair proceeded to row down lake for the boathouse rather than return to the finish line for the usual winning pre sentation ceremony. The vic tors finally turned about after they were paged over the pub lic address system. ??

22-> DRUGS REPORTED TIED TO VIETNAM PULLOUT
WASHINGTON, June 6 (UPI) — Representative Robert H. Steele, Republican of Connecti cut, said today that the high rate of heroin addiction among United States servicemen in Vietnam had prompted the Nix on Administration to seek a step‐up in its rate of troop withdrawals. He said that “high Adminis tration sources” had told him an attempt would be made to increase the current withdrawal rate of 14,300 men a month to about 20,000 beginning in Dec ember, reducing the total force in Vietnam to 50,000 or even perhaps 40,000 by July, 1972. Representative Steele said in a statement made public through his office that the plans were a direct result of his report to the House Foreign Affairs Committee that “the soldier going to Vietnam runs a far greater risk of becoming a heroin addict than a combat casualty.” Representative Steele and Representative Morgan F. Mur phy, Democrat of Illinois, re cently toured South Vietnam and other allied nations to study the problem of drug abuse. They reported that 10 to 15 per cent of American troops in Indochina were ad dicted to heroin. “The response of President Nixon to implement the recom mendations in my report has been immediate and decisive.” Representative Steele said in his statement today.

23-> GIANTS PREPARING ‘NEW LOOK’ ATTACK
Ron Johnson will probably start for the New York Giants against the St. Louis Cardinals tomorrow, as part of a “new look” offense on which the Giants will rely. The team's chief running back, who gained more than 1,000 yards last year but did not play in either of the first two Giant games this season, says he “feels fine.” His thigh which required shallow surgery when a bloodclot developed out of a charley horse, has healed, and he ran well in practice all week, including yesterday. But he hasn't had any physical contact since the third exhibition game, six weeks ago. “I don't think that's too important for a running back,” said Coach Alex Webster yesterday. “Still, I want to see him in tomorrow's workout before I make a definite decision.” Today, the Giants will work out early at Yankee Stadium before flying to St. Louis. Whether he starts or not, Johnson is certain to see some action. His presence and the reinstallation of the multiple‐formation offense are the basis for whatever optimism the Giants feel. The definite return of Bob Tucker, who will start at tight end, also helps. Tucker and Johnson, who have had a chess game going for two seasons now, represent the “middle‐distance gain” strength of the Giants. As a runner, Johnson can produce sizable chunks of yardage inside and out. That is, he might make 10 or 12 yards on a particular play instead of three or four, as well as break away occasionally. Tucker, a favorite receiver of Fran Tarkenton last year, is also adept at those relatively short pass plays that can produce first downs so reliably. As for the chess, Johnson is ahead. They play a “series” of best of 15 games. Last year Johnson won four series to two. This year, it's one series apiece with Johnson leading, 6‐3, in the third series going into this trip. And chess principles are involved in Webster's return to the more varied offense that the Giants used effectively a year ago, It includes I‐forma‐tion plays and hopes to establish an outside running strength to make passing easier. It gives the opposing defense more options to worry about.

24-> William M. Ryan of A.S.P.C.A. Dead
William Michael Ryan, Spe cial Agent. No, 1 of the Amer ican Society for the Preven tion of Cruelty to Animals, died Saturday night in Columbus Hospital after a long illness, He was 78 years old and lived at 647 East 14th Street. Mr. Ryan had worked for the A.S.P.C.A. for almost 59 years. He started as a driver of the Society's bright red horse am bulance in 1912 and over the years became the organization's animal rescue expert. On his 50th anniversary with the society he estimated that he had handled assignments in volving at least 500,000 mam mals, birds, fish, reptiles and miscellaneous insects. Mr. Ryan once rescued a horse in a funeral cortege on the Queensboro Bridge that had caught a hind leg in the lattice work. Another time he man euvered a horse through a din ing room after it became stuck under a brownstone stairway with two legs trapped in gar bage cans. Mr. Ryan invented several devices for rescuing animals that are now standard equip ment in many countries. One, a pole for taking cats out of trees, is patterned after the sticks used by grocers to pull cans down from high shelves. He also devised a horse sling used to help horses out of riv ers cellars and excavations. His pole with lasso attached for snaring loose dogs is a standard item in humane so cieties today. Mr. Ryan was born in this city on May 31. 1893. At the age of 12 he went to work selling papers, shining shoes and grooming horses. While in high school he worked as a coachman for some of New York's wealthy families. Later, he put horses through their paces at the New York Horse Exchange and sold horses on commission. His father, a horse handler in Ireland, came to this country in 1885 as a race horse trainer. Mr. Ryan was the subject of a book published nine years ago, entitled “Fifty Years in the Doghouse.” Since 1962, he had been pri marily engaged in training new A.S.P.C.A. agents. He is survived by his widow, the former May DeMott. The Ryans had no children. A funeral service will be held Wednesday at 10 A.M. at the Andrett Funeral Home, 353 Second Avenue.

25-> ‘What Good Came of It at Last?’
AHMADABAD, India — The English poet Robert Southey (1774–1843) wrote an admirable poem, “After Blenheim.” It could have been written about Indo china. The battle of Blenheim was fought in Bavaria in August, 1713, when the English and their allies, under the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy, gave a crushing de feat to the French and their allies. To bring out the suffering of the people during the conflict the poet introduces simple characters and puts words in their mouths to show their horror. The poem starts with a soft note. Two little Bavarian children, Wilhel mine and her brother Peterkin, are playing in a field near a rivulet. Peter kin finds “something large and smooth and round.” They take it to their grandfather, old Kaspar. With a sigh the old man explains: “It is some poor fellow's skull Who fell in the great victory.” He told them that the field where they were playing was actually the battlefield of Blenheim, and he had found several such skulls while tilling the soil. Then he described the horrors he had passed through and I give the version in his own words: It has now dawned on the people of the United States that to die in defense of one's country or to die for a just cause is a noble and glorious sacrifice. But to lay down one's life for a cause unintelligible to him, or to lay dawn one's life to cover the mistakes and stupidity of others is a mean, meaningless, wasteful and wan ton sacrifice. Now we reach the concluding part of the poem. Old Kaspar harps on the great victory at Blenheim, while the children are appalled by the suffering of the people because of it. Little Peterkin poses a question, “What good came of it at last?” and old Kas par replies: “Why, that I cannot tell.” What purpose is served by putting that question to old Kaspar? Go and ask old farmer Chung Ky and his wife Ma Bo in a remote village in Viet nam! Their house has been burnt, their field has been destroyed by chemicals and their two sons have been killed by indiscriminate bombing. Go and ask them, “What good came of it?” Go and ask old Peter Fraser and his wife Martha in a remote town in Kansas in the United States of America. They have in their hands a telegram which they try to read and understand with some difficulty. It informs that Robert — their only son, nay, their only child — has been killed in action in a remote village in Vietnam! Go, go and ask them, “What good came of it?” Go and ask eight‐year‐old little Ming Li who cries her eyes out to recall her mother whose burnt and charred body lies in a ditch within twenty feet of her, in a remote village in Cambodia. Go and ask little Ming Li “What good came of it?” Go and ask pretty Betty Balfour, aged 7, and her beautiful mother Mary Balfour, aged 27, of Palo Alto, Cali fornia. The mother and daughter had verily enjoyed paradise on earth when John Balfour, aged 28, the father of pretty Betty and the husband of beau tiful Mary had returned to Palo Alto on leave for three weeks from the war front in Indochina. All these days the daughter and the mother had romped and sung and danced with John. John had carried his pretty little daughter shoulder high and had hugged his loving wife. If there is paradise on earth the three of them — the father, the mother and the little daughter — had enjoyed it for twenty‐one days. And now after one month beautiful Mary Balfour stands terror‐stricken with a telegram in her hand informing her that her beloved husband John had been killed in a remote village in Cambodia. Pretty Betty Balfour, aged 7, sensing what had happened, rushes to her mother and buries her face, and mother and daughter weep, weep and weep. “What good came of it?” Go to the length and breadth of the United States and Indochina and ask the parents who have lost their sons, possibly their only child, wives who have lost their husbands, chil dren who have lost their fathers, sisters who have lost their brothers, brothers who have lost their brothers, friends who have lost their friends — Go and ask them, “What good came of it?”

26-> Zappa's Musicians Rock Through Epic Of Stylized Traveler
There is no good way of tell ing what the Mothers of Inven tion are up to. What Frank Zappa, the leader, has in mind at any particular time is inde terminate. The Los Angeles based rock group played Satur day and yesterday at the Fill more East and, rather than try an interpretation, I decided to make a list. The Mothers play here infre quently and usually have some thing to say, doing it in a structured, if sardonic and a bit ludicrous, rock cantata format. This time, the first half of their set was taken up with an epic about “a quasi‐religious hero” named Studebaker Hawk who encountered—in his travels— poison gas, Aunt Jemima syrup, boxer shorts, a parking lot, the armed forces, a New Jersey forest restoration project, a dog [house, the draft, a mountain named Billy and someone Lnamed Ethel. The second half of their set was instrumental—Mr. Zappa's Ifamiliar rock‐jazz, sort of a big band Grateful Dead. The Mothers of Invention have always been one of the more worthwhile projects in the rock field. They seem now to have settled into a comfort able compromise, dividing their concerts between outlandish stories and flowing jazz‐rock. They shared the bill at the Fill more with the Hampton Grease Band and Head Over Heels.

27-> Delay in Training Hurt Canonero, Trainer Says
Juan Arias, the trainer of Canonero H, said yesterday that the defeated favorite in Satur day's Belmont Stakes, won by Peter Kissel's Pass Catcher, came out of the race in good shape. He added, though, that he had considered early last week recommending to the owner, Pedro Baptista, that the horse be scratched because of the fungus condition that had been afflicting him since he won the Preakness at Pimlico on May 15. When the colt showed signs of responding to treatment Arias decided against scratch ing. He conceded yesterday that the break in the training pro gram of the colt, who had also won the Kentucky Derby on May 1 and who was seeking to become the first Triple Crown winner in 23 years, worked against Canonero's chances in the big race. The horse lost two days In his training schedule, one a week ago Saturday when a 1⅛‐mile workout was planned for the 1½‐mile Belmont. Arias said tears came to his eyes when he saw Canonero rush to the lead in the Bel mont, knowing that the colt would not be able to sustain the pace and to come through with a finishing kick. The immediate future of Canonero H is uncertain be cause Baptista is contemplating selling him. A leading metals manufacturing executive in Ca racas, Baptista said four groups representing Japan, England, Venezuela and the United States would meet with him at a date not specified to con sider the transaction. No price was mentioned, but Baptista, a keen student of breeding, said he would like to sell to United States interests because this country had more good mares. Canonero is a Kentucky‐bred son of Pre tendre and was sold at the Keeneland yearling sales for $1,200. The horse is here under a temporary permit with a six month limit. When Canonero arrived in Miami from Venezu ela, en route to the Derby, he was kept in quarantine for four days and not permitted to move from the stall or even to be visited by Jose Quintero, his groom. Arias blames this long, un broken confinement in quarters that were not cleaned for the fungus condition that affected the animal. As for the real star of the show, Pass Catcher, he slipped out of town unobstrusively on the night of his triumph. His trainer, Eddie Yowell, moved him to Monmouth Park, where he will compete in the Mon mouth Invitation on Aug. 7. He is also expected to run in the Travers at Saratoga.

28-> Microwave Ovens, At a Rate of 1 in 10, Held to Be Leaking
WASHINGTON, July 22—The Public Health Service estimates that one out of every 10 micro wave ovens in home use in the United States last year proba bly leaked radiation in excess of the industry's own voluntary limits. The agency's estimate was based on tests of almost 5,000 ovens in 25 states. Data from the report, to be released tomorrow, showed ra diation leaks of up to 100 milli watts for each square centi meter in ovens tested with their protective doors closed. This compared with emissions of up to 200 M.S.C. in those tested with open doors. The industry's limit is 10 M.S.C. The survey disclosed that of 155 ovens tested in New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Mississippi, 51 leaked radiation, including three at levels of 100 M.S.C., one at 110 M.S.C., two at 140 M.S.C. and one at 200 M.S.C. Frequent and prolonged ex posures to microwave radiation have been linked to eye cata racts and burns in man and sterility and blood damage in animals. Leakages in the ovens were due in some cases to faulty design, especially in models built before 1968, the agency said. In other instances, ship ping damage and consumer carelessness were to blame, the report said.

30-> GOLD PRICE IN LONDON HITS 18‐MONTH HIGH
LONDON, April 30 (UPI)— Gold prices increased today at a new high and the United States dollar sagged further amid continued speculation in European financial centers that the United States may be forced to raise the price of gold. But dealers said there was no big gold buying spree. They attributed the continued rise to a shortage of supplies on the free market. In London, the free market gold price reached $39.70 — a 15‐cent rise over Thursday. It was the highest reached here since November, 1969. In Paris, the price was $39.99 up from $39.84 Thursday. In Frankfurt, it was $39.43 up from $39.27. The official United States buying price is $35. This re mains the price in official transactions between central banks.

31-> N.B.C. IS GUILTY IN PRIVACY CASE
PIERRE, S.D., Oct 1 (AP)—A United States District Court jury yesterday found the National Broadcasting Company guilty of invading the privacy of a South Dakota rancher and awarded him $25,000. The case involved Baxter Berry, a 65‐year‐old rancher in Belvidere, who had sued the network for $1‐million, alleging that “Between Two Rivers,” segment of N.B.C.'s monthly “First Tuesday” series, which it broadcast on Dec. 2, 1969, had invaded his privacy and held him up to public ridicule and contempt. Mr. Berry's attorneys charged that N.B.C. had come to South Dakota with the preconception that it was a racist state with a double standard of justice—one for whites, another for Indians. Thereafter, the attorneys charged, the network used any evidence it found to support that preconception, and ignored any that did not. Mr. Berry had been acquitted by an all‐white jury on Sept. 25, 1969, of charges that he murdered Norman Little Brave on his ranch on March 21, 1969. Mr. Berry said he had shot in self‐defense. In the suit against N.B.C., Mr. Berry's attorneys alleged that “Between Two Rivers” had insinuated that Mr. Berry was guilty of murder, but had been acquitted because he was wealthy, influential white man who had shot an Indian. Carleton G. Eldridge Jr., N.B.C.'s attorney, said he would not comment on the verdict because the case was still in litigation, leaving little doubt that an appeal was planned. Defending the network, Mr. Eldridge had argued that a verdict against N.B.C. would have a chilling effect on freedom of the press. He cited United States Supreme Court decisions showing that the plaintiff had to prove “actual malice,” which he defined as “knowledge of a false statement or reckless disregard of whether it may be false or not.” Witnesses called by N.B.C. had testified that they had become aware of a few factual errors in the program after it had been televised, not before, and the network averred that no actual malice had been demonstrated.

32-> Swiss Bank Policy Defended by Aide
WASHINGTON, April 30— A known mafia member or other criminal figure would have a hard time opening a bank account in Switzerland, numbered or otherwise, a lead ing Swiss banker said today. Dr. E. F. Paltzner, general manager of one of the “big three” Swiss banks, the Swiss Bank Corporation, sought in a speech here to “dispel some of the erroneous conceptions which cloud” the subject of Swiss banking secrecy. He ad dressed a periodic “business men's luncheon” at the George town Club. He conceded that “there is a difference of opinion which it would be foolish to deny” be tween Switzerland and the United States over one issue of banking ecy in particular —disclosure of information involving tax evasion. But on other matters he made the fol lowing points, not widely known in the United States: ¶A numbered‐account is sim ply designed to limit the num ber of persons within the bank who have knowledge of an in dividual's transactions. It is just as subject to disclosure, under certain carefully pre scribed procedures established under Swiss law, as an ordi nary account. ¶“Swiss banks accept deposits only from persons whose names and creden tials are known to them ... charges have been voiced against Swiss banks suggesting that accounts can easily be opened by criminals and well known mobsters. The truth is otherwise. Not only do banks refuse to accept dubious clients, they also do not hesitate to terminate business relations with customers who do not meet the required standards.” ¶Swiss banks are required to disclose information in criminal cases, as defined in Swiss law, including “requests by other countries with which Switzer land had signed agreements providing for assistance in legal matters.” ¶While the tax evasion is not a criminal offense in Switzer land, tax fraud is, and informa tion may be required to be dis closed in such cases. Dr. Paltzer described the historical circumstances that gave rise to the principle of banking privacy in Switzer land, which he conceded was more strict than in some other countries. He concluded: “The concept of the Swiss banking secret is not absolute. It has its limitations, and our legal system does not prevent the Swiss authorities from col laborating effectively with other governments in the in terest of public law and safety where such collaboration is nec essary. “If the banking secret has been used sometimes for nefarious purposes, contrary to the public interest of our coun try or of a foreign nation, that is no reason for sacrificing the principle. That principle is founded on the legitimate protection of private property and individual liberty and privacy.”

33-> Patents of the Week
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1—A California company specializing in pollution control received patents this week for a smog‐free automobile. Richard D. Smith, president, and. Dale A. Furlong, chief engineer of the Combustion Power Company, Menlo Park, were grant ed Patents 3,608,529 and 3,608,660. The HyOx engine, which has been built but not yet road‐tested, is designed to burn pure hydrogen or gasoline as fuel, with the injection of pure liquid oxygen. The cylinders are cooled by a water spray. According to a spokesman, as no air is drawn in there is no generation of nitrogen oxide, the air pollutant. The essential character of the modern internal combustion engine is retained. The small motor, ordinarily producing 50 horsepower for cruising, is described as capable of stimulation to 250 horsepower for high speed. The HyOx engine has been proposed to the large motor companies, but so far with no takers. The Union Carbide Corporation cooperated in the design of the system. The chief current project of Combustion Power is the development for the Environmental Protection Agency, under contract, of a system for the use of municipal waste in the production of fuel for power plants. The company was organized four years ago and has 65 employes, drawn chiefly from the aerospace and defense industries. * A self‐deploying arm was invented by two aerospace engineers to serve as a boom or antenna in spacecraft, but they, suggest a variety of other possible uses. It could retrieve objects from a burning building, serve as an escape chute, or erect itself as an instant tent pole or instant plumbing. William T. Tumulty Jr. and Wayne P. Sours of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland were granted Patent 3,608,844 this week. A strip of metal or other material is wound on a spool so that it unwraps between the spool and an adjacent roller when released, without requiring any pull. The size, thickness and cross‐section can be varied. A U‐shaped arm could form an aircraft escape chute, and a plastic tube could carry electric wires or water. The structure may be made double, with one form inside the other. So far the invention, which is called Minimech because its mechanism has a minimum of moving parts, has not been used in space. Civilian applications await private development under license. * Saul Greenspan, who controls several Brooklyn apartment buildings, was granted a patent this week for a smoke filter that is said to meet requirements of a city ordinance for the upgrading of incinerators. The apparatus protected by Patent 3,608,278 fits on a chimney top and holds a suction blower that carries soot and other solid matter into a collecting chamber. A burner reduces the size of large particles. By reversing the air flow, the filters can be cleaned. Access doors on the various floors, through which tenants throw their trash, are closed during operation. A pilot installation, which has been in use in a Brooklyn building for two years, was examined by the United States Testing Company, Inc., and reported as complying with the ordinance. Mr. Greenspan regards his filter as superior to the water “scrubber” systems. S. G. Pollutant Burners, Inc., has been organized in New York to promote the invention. * A cash‐handling system called Safe‐O‐Matic, which was patented this week, is described as immune to robbery and mistakes. Patent 3,608,690, granted to Robert D. Morrow and Donald E. Miller, is assigned to Technology Systems, Inc., a Baltimore company of which Mr. Morrow is president. If the machine is installed at a checkout counter, the clerk will ring up a sale and put in the customer's cash. The Safe‐O‐Matic then takes over, sorting the bills and coins, making calculations and disbursing any change. The money is examined for validity both optically and magnetically. The machine's magazines, which take the place of the usual cash drawer, will hold up to $6,000. Mr. Morrow says it never pays out more than it takes in. Technology Systems has made prototypes and is prepared to supply the American market. A European manufacturer has also been licensed.

35-> Ali to Face Mathis in Houston Nov. 17
With his planned Tokyo bout with Mac Foster on Nov. 2 canceled because “the people didn't get up the money,” Muhammad Ali will oppose Buster Mathis in a 12‐round heavyweight bout on Wednesday, Nov. 17, at the Houston Astrodome. “I'm reviving all these fighters,” All said yesterday at news conference at the Americana Hotel. “He qualifies.” The 27‐year‐old Mathis is unranked. He hasn't competed in 2½ years since losing a unanimous 12‐round decision, at Madison Square Garden to Jerry Quarry, who recorded a second‐round knockdown. Mathis's other loss, against 29 victories, was an 11th‐round knockout by Joe Frazier in 1968 at the Garden for the New York version of the title vacated by Ali's suspension at the time. “I weigh about 265 now,” Mathis said. “I hope to be 245, 240 for the fight.” Ali has been guaranteed $300,000 against 40 per cent of the total receipts. Mathis will collect 15 per cent, but his Peers Management backers will supply $200,000 of the former heavyweight champion's guarantee. Bob Arum of Top Rank, Inc., estimated that the bout must attract at least $700,000 for Mathis to begin collecting on his share. Ali has a 32‐1 won‐lost reccrd, losing a unanimous 15‐ round decision to Frazier in (their title showdown last March. Arum indicated that he would be receptive to a closed‐circuit TV or home‐TV double‐header with a Floyd Patterson‐Oscar Bonavena bout, scheduled for Nov. 19 at the Garden, if the match were advanced two days. There is no other Garden attraction scheduled Nov. 17. “Arum talked to me about it nebulously,” said Harry Markson, the Garden boxing director. “But no real proposal was made. We won't seek a doubleheader. We feel that our attraction is something solid, whereas their attraction is question‐mark. We don't need it.”

36-> State's New Copter Draws Ire of Staff Hit by Budget Cuts
ALBANY, April 29 — The acquisition of a new $700,000 conservation helicopter at the same time as the dismissal of 8,400 state workers is proving to be an embarrassment to Henry L. Diamond, the state's Com missioner of Environmental Conservation. “Who needs it?” an official of the Civil Service Employes Association commented today, asserting that the current state budget cuts are sparing “fat cat” commissioners, their limousines —and now their helicopter— at the expense of low‐salary workers. The new helicopter has be come a symbol of the civil servants' complaint. Commis sioner Diamond said it was or dered last year, with last year's budget money, to spray pests and fight fires—not to carry executives. “If we could trade the chopper for bodies, we would,” Mr. Diamond said. “But it was put into last year's supple mentary budget and those funds can't be switched from that purpose.” “I have to admit the timing of this is very embarrassing,” the Commissioner added. But, he said, the helicopter is needed by the state to patrol its woodlands. In addition, it will be put to use in rescue missions. The helicopter will cost about $90 an hour to operate, and about 500 to 600 hours of an nual use are foreseen. The helicopter's acquisition —announced in Albany news papers—comes as the Commis sioner is deciding how to cut several hundred workers from his staff as his share of the budget cut. The budget reduc tions are closing about a third of the forest stations in the state, with air surveillance to be used instead. Complaining workers say the suddenness and unreasonable ness of the legislature's deci sion to cut portions is shown in other ways. For example, most state civil defense work ers, who are being laid off, feel doubly bitter because they say, a new limousine arrived for the Civil Defense Commission only a few weeks before they re ceived their pink slips.

37-> Judaism's own Dan Berrigan
Daniel Berrigan, while still a priest on the run, made his celebrated Cornell appearance and escape dur ing the celebration of Arthur Was kow's “Peace Seder”—a liturgy con demned by many Jews, especially those who neglect the conventional Seder. Their attitude seems to be that of lapsed or lukewarm Catholics toward the old Latin Mass—By God, if I ever go to Mass again, that's the kind of Mass I want to find. One of Elizabeth Cullinan's characters put it best—the odd desire to leave the church, go out and “find oneself,” and then return, a prodigal to be feted. That whole fantasy depended on the church's being there when one de cided to return. The fun goes out of it if you have to keep wondering whether the church will be there, after all, when you turn around. Per haps those who stayed will have ruined it. The traitors, in other words, remained inside the walls, while true defenders went off for a bit of theo R and R. Arthur Waskow is staying—indeed, he is fast becoming Judaism's own Dan Berrigan, one steeped in his tra dition's scriptures and prophets and poets. True, he has not been engaged in theological self‐scrutiny for as long as Berrigan, nor written (till now) as well, nor been (yet) as much reviled and punished. But there he was amid all the Roman collars at the 1963 arrests made by a man little known to the nation then, County Executive Spiro Agnew. Ag new, who arrested these clergymen and their followers for trying to in tegrate an amusement park in Wood lawn, Md., recently took credit on TV for getting blacks admitted to that park. In a way, that's true—Agnew did it by causing a great stir with his arrests. Anyone whose jail ing gets surreptitiously tucked among the moral credits of a Vice President is no small figure in the world of religious politics. Still, as this book admits, Waskow, a fellow of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, did not begin to take his Jewish heritage with full seriousness until the spring of 1968. Since then he has worked overtime at it, studying the Torah, visiting Israel, writing and celebrating litur gies, consulting his predecessors and comrades in the attempt to fashion radically new form of Halakic life—e.g., with a kashrut (or kosher‐code) that excludes food harvested by non union labor or is grown with the help of pollutant chemicals. The charge most often leveled against Waskow, as against Berrigan, is that his religion is a mere “baptiz ing” (or circumcizing) of his politics — as when he calls the Talmud “seminary notes” from a “free uni versity,” or Shabbat (the Sabbath) man's “first general strike.” The test of such things must always be in practise—do they deepen religious in sight, or cynically feed on it? It will be difficult for readers of this book to consider it an exploitation of Judaism rather than the expression of stunned new reverence for it. The radical politics was always there in Waskow; what has been added gives new richness to the politics, but also extends beyond it. The writer's style has deepened, too, toward the lucid cadences of his Seder and the other ceremonies he composes (some included in the book). The writing is both simpler and more resonant than in his earlier books, most persuasive when most personal and almost psalm‐like. The life to which he is being drawn, and calling others, is prophetic in the ancient sense — i.e., pre‐figurative. A man foreshadows the Great Shabbat, brings it into being, by living forward into it, proleptically. This is the deep est spring for Waskow's nonviolence, the renunciation of mere counter tactics used against Pharaoh: “The only means we may use are those that partake of the ends themselves, and to reject illegitimate means is not to postpone the revolution but to bring it nearer.” The book ends with a meditation on exodus—how Moses had to prophesy (live through it ahead of time) the “going‐out” before a public exodus could follow and fulfill his private one; how the goal is only formulated on the way — God given his new name from the bush, people given their law from the mount, once the going‐out has been achieved (an earlier chapter builds a whole theology of Diaspora on this point); and how going‐out remains the task of those who would keep on the way to Zion (which is not simply equatable with the Israeli nation, though there is growing Zion in Israel, as in the Diaspora). This chapter recalls exo dus patterns in the Christian gospels. Jesus calls away—from the nets, and tax offices, and Temple tables; he goes out—to pray in hiding, preach on a mount, feed in a wilderness, suffer in a garden (while those he left behind lapse into old habits), be disappointed by his own, and die while still on the way. Christianity did not leave the Temple once for all; it must “go out” constantly from new Temples, sacred and secular, fulfilling the exodus Jesus pre‐enacted. Waskow stresses that Judah is itself the Messiah, in process of coming — as Christians teach that “the body of the faithful” is itself Jesus, all its members “living stones” being built into that unseen Zion to which men have been called. The people of “the One” become Messiah by looking outward to the One—a people with two faces, as it were, each unable to see itself except by looking at the other, as in a mirror's reverse image. That, I think, is the true significance of (among other things) Arthur Waskow's re semblance to Daniel Berrigan.

39-> Chain's Volume Off
The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, the nation's largest food chain, made its poorest showing in sales and earnings in more than 10 years, according to results issued yesterday for the second fiscal quarter and half‐year periods ended with August. Second‐quarter sales of $1,372,172,000 were off 3.3 per cent from volume of $1,418,448,000 in the corresponding three months last year. Net earnings dropped 53 per cent to $5,792,000, or 24 cents a share, from $12,309,000, or 49 cents a share, for the respective periods. Sales for the six months were $2,741,630,000 against $2,837,957,000 a year earlier, or off 3.4 per cent. Net earnings fell 29 per cent to $17,336,000, or 70 cents a share, from $24,564,000, or 99 cents a share, in the similar half of the 1970 fiscal year, based on the 24,875,224 shares of stock outstanding in both years. “The decline in profits reSuited plainly from accelerated competition in major markets and sharp increases in labor and other costs of doing business that could not be passed on to the consumer in higher food prices,” a spokesman for the company explained. He said the cost‐price squeeze became more pronounced in July following completion of a new labor contract that substantially increased wage costs in several areas, mainly in the Eastern region. Despite this, the executive said, “we had to maintain our lower price structure with a consequent pressure on operating costs.” The spokesman also cited intensive market competition from popular local chains in certain areas. The report stated that there were 4,358 A. & P. stores in operation at the end of August, compared with 4,482 last year. In its accelerating development program, the A. & P. is opening 120 stores this year with an average of 20,000 square feet each. These larger‐volume stores are being opened in growth areas or in territories where smaller, obsolete stores have been closed in order to keep the chain's representation. But for the most part the comany has been closing more stores than it has been opening. For instance, in fiscal 1970 there were 70 stores opened and 218 closed and in the first half of this year 121 stores were closed. Although the company's best quarter is generally the final one covering December, January and February, the spokes. man would not make any prediction on the outlook for the last half of its fiscal year or for the year as a whole. Leading food chains in the nation so far this year have shown an 8 per cent gain in sales. Winn‐Dixie Stores, Inc,, which operates a chain of more than 840 food markets predominantly in the South, reported yesterday higher sales and earnings for the 12 weeks ended Sept. 18. Net profit was $7,693,260, equal to 59 cents a share, up from $6,126,275, or 48 cents share, in the correstponding quarter last year. Sales were $391,583,848 against $344,238,857. In announcing the results to shareholders, Bert L. Thomas, president, attributed the increase mainly to an improve. ment in average sales per store and continued emphasis on expense control. “Current wage and price regulations should not significantly affect our profit picture during the 90‐day freeze, but we cannot forecast the effect on future operations until longrange government regulations and plans are known,” the officer said. The company has budgeted 68 new stores for opening in fiscal 1972. Plans also call for warehouse enlargements and new meat processing plant in Madison, Fla., which will be opened soon. Sales and earnings of the Toro Manufacturing Corporation in the fiscal year ended July 31 reached records, it was reported yesterday by the nation's leading independent producer of powered lawn and turf care equipment. On sales of $67,586,000, up 17 per cent from $57,757,000 the year before, net earnings were $3,067,000, or $1.51. share, compared with $2,918,000, or $1.44 a share, for fiscal 1970. The 5 per cent increase in earnings trailed the sales gain because of heavy introductory costs for new products and development investments in entering new business areas, David T. McLaughlin, president, said. He noted that 47 per cent of Toro sales were derived from new products during the 1971 fiscal year.

40-> WALL STREET
Despite some talk to the contrary, Muriel Siebbrt, the first and now only woman member of the New York Stock. Exchange, has no thoughts about selling, membership on the exchage. “Never, never,” Miss Sie bert said last week when asked about rumors that she might be about to sell her membership. “I couldn't let the exchange go back to be ing an all‐male playground, could I?” she asked. Miss Siebert went on to say that her firm, Muriel Siebert & Co., was more in terested in expanding than retrenching and was thinking of possible acquisitions. “But we would be the acquirer,” she said firmly. Like other brokers, Miss Siebert would like to get in to the money‐manageinent field. “It spreads the use of research,” she ‐explained. “You get more action for the same effort.” The chief problem, she added, is that until the cur rent debate over further changes in commission rates and the possibility of invest ment institutions becoming members of the exchange is settled, no one knows just where (or whether) a mon ey‐management operation will fit in with a brockerage operation. Meanwhile, Miss Siebert re ported that her firm's busi ness was “awfully good” and prospects appeared bright for her type of small, re search‐oriented firm. The quality of research at larg er, competing firms, she be lieves, is bound to deterio rate as they try to bring high overhead costs in line with a reduced flow of com mission dollars. Itonically, Miss Siebert's seat on the Big Board prob ably represents one of her poorer investments. She paid $445,000 for the seat in 1968. The most recent seat sale was made at $215,000. Investors of the world, write! That was the invitation is sued last week by the New York'Stock Exchange. The exchange didn't say it quite that way of course. What it did say was that its Committee on Reorganizetion, which is studying rec7 commendations made recent ly by William McChesney, Martin Jr., had “invited all interested parties to submit, their suggestions to the com mittee.” The committee is headed by Cornelius W. Owens, an executive vice president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and one of the three public governors of the exchange. The committee, Mr. Owens said, “is most eager to con sider any worthwhile ideas that may be contributed by those who have a particu lar interest in this matter.“. He added: “Among those we would be happy to hear from are individual investors, groups representing invest ors, institutional investors and non‐member firms.” These “interested parties,” it might be noted, are the last to be invited to contribute, suggestions for the commit tee's deliberations. The first invitation went to presidents of companies whose stocks are listed on the exchange. The second went to mem bers and allied members of the exchange. Last and or least, the pub lic can send suggestions to Mr. Owens at the exchange, whose address is 11 Wall Street, New York 10005. Happy‐days‐must‐be‐here again note: Anthony Kane Associates, Inc., one of Wall Street's larger person nel recruiting houses, last week advertised an opening for a director of research at an investment and re search firm. It provides for “base compensation to $125, 000 as well as equity par ticipation.” With just a bit of under statement, Nicholas Crispi, one of the Kane recruitersr observed: “Things are be ginning to look up.” The high price, he added, reflects growing expectations of banner stock market year In 1972. John J. Maloney, who has been handling public rela tions and advertising for Leh man Brothers for the last eight years, is heading north eastward to Bridgeport, Conn., where he will be di rector of public relations for Warnaco, Inc., whose prod ucts range from women's girdles (Warner's) to men's shirts (Hathaway). Warnaco also is an investment‐bank ing client of Lehman. In his pre‐Lehman days, Mr. Malon ey was assistant director of public relations for the New York Stock Exchange.

42-> STRIKE OUT WINS $81,216 FUTURITY
WESTBURY, L. I., Oct. 1—Strike Out, one of two outstanding Canadian‐owned standardbreds, cast a strong vote for himself in the competition for the season's pacing honors among 2‐year‐olds by winning the $81,216 Roosevelt Futurity tonight at Roosevelt Raceway. Silent Majority, the other topflight juvenile from north of the border, was a contender for only about an eighth of the one mile classic. At that stage, Buddy Gilmour, catch ‐ driving Strike Out for John Hayes Sr., displaced Berry Hanover at the top and Herve Filion found an opening along the rail for Silent Majority. At the quarter, it was Strike Out, a chestnut son of Bret Hanover, in 0:29 4–5 and there was no catching the ace pacer from the Beejay Stables of Oshawa, Ont. Gilmour, who had not won so rich a race in his 20 years of driving, proceeded to steer Strike Out to a three‐quarterlength decision over the Vernon Dancer‐driven Berry Hanover. Baron Gerard, guided by Lew Williams, and Silent Majority followed in the field of 10. Timed in 2:01 4–5 for the mile, Strike Out returned $5.20 for $2 to win. Silent Majority, a 16‐time winner, compared with the dozen victories now credited to Strike Out, was the 11‐10 favorite. The choice encountered a bit of traffic trouble en route in this 12th edition of the Futurity, but there really was no question concerning the superiority of Strike Out. The winner, who benefited from a second quarter in 0:32 1/5, had not been driven by Gilmour before tonight. Hayes turned over the reins to Buddy because of stomach trouble and never regretted it, as Gilmour turned in a flawless drive to clinch first money of $40,608.27. Acquired for $15,000 as a yearling, Strike Out has now earned $135,116. Gihnour liked everything about his charge, especially the first quarter of 0:29.5. Gilmour's previous highest purse was $56,000 in a New York Sire Stakes event.

45-> PRICES RECEIVED BY FARMERS DROP
WASHINGTON, April 30 (AP)—Prices received by farm ers for raw products dropped one per cent in April, the first downward trend since last De cember, the Agriculture De partment announced today. Crop Reporting Board offi cials said lower prices for hogs, milk and lettuce con tributed to most of the decline. Higher prices were reported for cattle and cotton. Average prices for farm products had risen since last December before holding steady in March. Hog prices average $16 per hundredweight in April, com pared with $16.90 in March and $23.80 a year earlier. All beef cattle averaged $29.10 per hun dredweight, compared with $28.60 in March, the same as a year earlier. Corn averaged $1.41 per bushel, compared with $1.43 in March and $1.15 a year earlier. Meantime, farm expenses, which almost monthly have set records, rose one per cent dur ing the month ended April 15, the report said. They were four per cent more than a year ago. The parity ratio, based on a 1910–1914 cost and price rela tionship, dropped during the month to 69 per cent. From 70 per cent in March and 72 per cent a year earlier.

TO THE EDITOR: I strongly deny and object to the statements attributed to me by Martha Weinman Lear in her article, “New York's Haitians: Working, Waiting, Watching Beb6 Doc” (Oct. 10). Martha Weinman Lear has quoted me as having said, “Haitians generally are more sophisticated than black Americans” and “Haitians will not fight for civil rights in the street. They will fight you brain to brain. But they cannot be assimilated with your whites, who permit no contact. And they do not want to be integrated with your blacks., They say, ‘Why integrate? I have no need to be Negro twice.’ “ I not only did not make these statements, but my ex perience and struggle along with and for black Americans dates back to 1946. The quo tations are entirely in oppo sition to my philosophy and have caused me great social and political distress. I do hereby request that you re tract these statements, remov ing my name as having been the author of same. GASTON JUMELLE, M.D. Brooklyn.

47-> CITY UNIT ASSAILS STATE DRUG STUDY
Mayor Lindsay's Narcotics Control Council issued a point by‐point denunciation yester day of the conclusions reached by the State Commission of In vestigation after public hear ings on the city's narcotics problem. After nine days of hearings ended April 22, the state com mission said police corruption, prosecutors and the courts were largely responsible for in effective narcotics‐law enforce ment. The Mayor's group termed the conclusion “neither impartial nor professional.” The 13‐member council, headed by the Mayor, charged yesterday that the state com mission “completely miscon ceives the problems of drug ad diction, addict treatment and the criminal‐justice process.” The statement characterized the hearings as “a naive distor tion of the problems of narcot ics‐law enforcement and a grossly inaccurate assessment of the city's efforts in this area.” The council indicated that it found virtually no area of agreement with the state group on how best to deal with the acknowledged “drug crisis.” And the council implied that the hearings, at which 46 wit nesses testified, were a waste of time and should be reopened so that the state group could “study more deeply the sub jects it was asked to investi gate.” Paul J. Curran, chairman of the State Commission of Inves tigation, had strongly criticized the performance of the police, prosecutors and the courts in handling of heroin dealers, say ing their actions had corroded enforcement of narcotics laws. Mr. Curran declined at the conclusion of the hearings to Identify those individuals he felt were responsible for the alleged Ineffectiveness. However, the commission made clear that it felt that po lice corruption and the policies of the Board of Education and others were largely responsible for the situation. Yesterday, the city group re plied that “for an arm of the state government to take cheap shots at the city's Police De partment, the Board of Educa tion and the Addiction Services Agency, while other arms of the state government are chok ing off the ability of those agencies to deal with the prob lem, is inappropriate at best.” The city panel said cuts by Albany in the State Narcotic Addiction Control Commission's treatment budget were forcing the closure of several rehabili tation programs. This, it said, “will add SO to 100 addicts week to the city's prisons, in creasing the likelihood of repe tition of the disturbances of last summer and fall” when riots broke out in several prisons. The Mayor's council also noted caustically that while the investigation commission criticized the Board of Education for ineffective drug programs, state budget cuts will eliminate 37 school programs designed treat addicted children. “The greatest disservice of S.I.C. chairman Curran's state ment,” the council said, “is the implication that we need not spend any more money on the painful search for better treat ment and rehabilitation pro grams. “Instead, says the S.I.C., sweep the streets, throw the addict‐sellers in jail and forget about them,” the council state ment said. “There would not be enough state or city prison facilities to lock up the thousands of addict sellers that the S.I.C. proposes to throw in jail,” the council said, adding that “the com mission's ignorance of this fact is appaling.” The Mayor's council was especially critical of what it said was the state commission's “almost total focus on police corruption.” Insisting that both Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy and Mayor Lindsay “have made their concern with police corruption unmistak able,” the council said that it was “unrealistic” to describe corruption as a major factor in the illegal drug market. “Heroin moves through inter national channels,” the council said, “ignoring state and na tional boundaries, and efforts to halt it cannot be confined to local police.” The members of the Mayor's council are: Gordon Chase. Health Services Administrator; Graham Finney, Commissioner Addiction Services Agency; Ed ward K. Hamilton, Director Bureau of the Budget; George F. McGrath, Commissioner of Corrections; Patrick V. Murphy, Police Commissioner. Also: Henry Ruth, director Criminal Justice Coordinating Council; Harold Siegel, secre tary, Board of Education; Her bert Sturtz, director, Vera In stitute of Justice; Jule M. Sugarman, Human Resources Administrator; Joseph B. Wil liams, Model Cities administra tor; Howard Samuels, Counsel lor to the Mayor and Joseph Meng, dean for student serve ices, City University.

49-> Black‐White Struggle in Africa: No One Is Winning
LUSAKA, Zambia — There are some who believe that the struggle for black rights in southern Africa will someday erupt into the nightmare of a full‐scale bloody race war. There are also blacks who fear that the white minority governments in Rhodesia, South Africa and in the Portuguese territories of Mozambique and Angola may someday launch punitive retaliation strikes against guerrilla sanctuaries in black Africa. For now, however, the strug gle between the white regimes and black forces is waged in a much less intense, if relentless, manner. Some incidents this spring help to describe the present character of a pro longed conflict. At the Liberation Center building here, which houses the headquarters‐in‐exile of black revolutionary movements, a young clerk for an Angolan lib eration unit began to unwrap a parcel received in the mail. It exploded, killing him. Kidnappings by both sides along the black‐white bounda ries have become fairly com mon. Recently a guerrilla group known as Coremo captured six Portuguese in Mozambique and announced that they were tak ing them to the independent na tion of Zambia. Zambian officials said that they had never permitted the prisoners to enter Zambia and had had no part in the affair. But the Portuguese angrily be gan a semiblockade of food shipments that customarily reach landlocked Zambia through the Mozambique port of Beira. Railway shipments of maize were simply delayed and at one point food reserves in Zambia fell to an alarming level—about a two weeks supply. The new maize harvest is now beginning here and the problem is easing. Black Africa has led the de mands for economic sanctions against the white south. But economic squeezes can work both ways. Rhodesian authorities in creased the rail freight rates on food shipments to Zambia. It also threatened to impose a large general‐freight surcharge unless Zambia stopped reduc ing the amount of her copper exports sent out through Rho desia. Three years ago Zambia was forced to expel one extremely militant Angolan guerrilla or ganization that had blown up the rail line that runs from Zambia through the Congo and Angola to Lobito Bay on the Atlantic. Zambia supports lib eration but it needs that rail way, and the Portuguese had indicated that they would de lay repairing it until they got some satisfaction. In one of the most unusual recent tactics used, South Af rica's Premier, John Vorster, rose in his Parliament to dis close the existence of three years of correspondence be tween him and the Zambian President, Kenneth D. Kaunda. Mr. Vorster's motive seemed to be to try to discredit Mr. Kaunda domestically and in ternationally. Mr. Kaunda is expected to lead the fight against proposals that black nations enter into a diplomatic discussions with South Africa. No one can really be said to be winning this kind of dif fuse, cautious struggle. Even decisive trends are difficult to detect. But both white and black forces have had some successes in diplomacy, which is assuming a growing impor tance in the conflict. A West African nation, the Ivory Coast, has publicly com mitted itself to the principle of “dialogue” with South Africa, and Uganda's new leader, Gen. Idi Amin, has said he would ac cept an invitation to the South African capital of Pretoria. Ten to 12 of the 41 black African states probably now favor contact with South Af rica, although some would cer tainly hesitate to press the is sue if it erupted into open con troversy at the summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity on June 21. On the other hand, more militant black nations were en couraged recently when the United States refused to au thorize an advance by the Ex port‐Import Bank to the General Electric Company to par ticipate in the $288‐million Por tuguese Cabora Bassa power and water project on the Zam bezi River in Mozambique. Diplomatic pressure had al ready driven Scandanavian and Italian companies out of par ticipation in the dam, which could encourage large‐scale set tlement by whites. South Africa's diplomatic aim in offering “dialogue” to black states is to split black Africa and dissolve a nearly solid anti‐South Africa bloc. The split is now little more than a small crack but repre sents a distinct success for Mr. Vorster. His attempt to discredit Mr. Kaunda, on the other hand, may, prove to be a mistake. Mr. Vorster's publicizing of secret correspondence with Mr. Kaun da may make other black lead ers reluctant to deal with him, some African politicians be lieve. The texts of the letters re leased by Zambia, moreover, in dicate that South Africa and not Mr. Kaunda initiated the exchange and that Mr. Kaunda did not offer any secret accom modation. Mr. Kaunda was an impor tant figure behind the Lusaka Manifesto of April, 1969, adopted by 13 Central and East African states. It said that these nations would urge the resis tance movements to use “peace ful methods” and to compro mise on timing if the white governments would embrace the idea of “peaceful progress” to emancipation. Conditions vary widely in the white‐ruled territories. In South Africa, there is no real guerrilla activity or even terrorism by blacks, but the potential for po litical organization is probably higher than elsewhere. In Rhodesia, black military activity has never been intense and has dwindled in the last year. Recently, however, a land mine caused casualties among a South African police unit op erating in Rhodesia. In Angola and Mozambique, black guerrillas are able to tie down large contingents of Portuguese troops and to oper ate within the territories. Portuguese generals, on the other hand, have recently be come more aggressive. “These are humble begin nings,” said President Kaunda in an interview recently. But he adds that he believes that the liberation organizations are not being reduced to impotence. “On the contrary, they are gaining ground,” he said. “I am very clear in my mind that these organizations are going to win these wars.” Mr. Kaunda argues, however, that he would prefer a peaceful settlement, partly to prevent bloodshed and partly to prevent radical political tendencies among the freedom fighters, who now must rely on China, the Soviet Union, Eastern Eu rope, Cuba and Algeria for mili tary equipment and training as sistance. “The question is, are these people going to win these wars with the good wishes of the West or of the East alone?” he said. “I am anxious to see Angala and Mozambique stay nonaligned instead of going East” Mr. Kaunda continues to be lieve, as he told Secretary of State William P. Rogers in 1970. that the United States should concentrate its diplomatic ef forts on Portugal, exerting pressure toward more self government and toward imple mentation of Portugal's ex pressed policy of nonracialism. If undertaken “seriously,” Mr. Kaunda said, “Portugal could not withstand that pres sure.” Mr. Kaunda offers to urge freedom fighters to guar antee the rights of white set tlers in a new nonracial society.

50-> Drought‐Ravaged Areas Widen
MIAMI, May I—The droughts that have severely damaged Florida and the Southwest ap peared this week to be moving into the Ohio Valley and Middle Atlantic States, according to national weather officials. Although not nearly as de veloped as the droughts that have denuded Texas rangelands and are threatening to destroy the Florida Everglades, the new droughts are pronounced enough to be labeled “moder ate” by the National Environ mental Data Service. Following cloud ‐ seeding flights over southern Florida to day, rain began falling at the rate of an inch an hour from Boca Raton south to Miami. However, the National Weather Service said that the rainfall would not “significantly allevi ate the drought conditions.” And a huge brush fire was still raging west of Miami. Many national and state forests have been closed be cause of fire hazards and there has been some crop damage, a survey showed. In New Jersey, for example, conditions were so bad that all forests, woodlands and open spaces were closed to the pub lic from April 22 to last Wednesday, when the drought conditions were found to have been eased by recent rains. Rain had also eased the sit uation in the metropolitan New York area by the end of the week, after a rash of brush fires. Wayne Palmer, a research matologist with the Environ mental Data Service at Silver Spring, Md., said the drought began to spread northeastward from Texas in March. The states affected to a no ticeable degree included Arkan sas, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, Virginia, West Vir ginia, Pennsylvania, New Jer sey, Maryland and parts of In diana, Ohio and Louisiana. The Texas drought had al ready spread northward into western Oklahoma and west ward through Arizona and New Mexico into Southern Cali fornia. “In some states, it is pretty spotty,” said Mr. Palmer. “In Ohio, for instance, only about six counties north of Canton are affected.” In West Texas and western Oklahoma the severe drought deepened in the last two weeks despite some rain 10 days earlier. Late last week dust storms were beginning to stir again, and there were plans to start seeding clouds at San Angelo. National weather officials said they could not predict when the droughts would end. But rain, some of it heavy, brought at least temporary re lief to several of the mid‐At lantic and Ohio Valley states, where the biggest effect of the below‐normal rain of the last six weeks has been an outbreak of forest fires. James O'Connor, the chief of the forecast branch of the ex tended division of the National Weather Service, said the pre vailing winds across the country were still flowing too much from the West to end the drought. He said that most of the Unit ed States east of the Continen tal Divide in the Rocky Mountains depended on the Gulf of Mexico for the moisture needed to make rain and that until the flow of air dipped down into the Gulf to pick up moisture, much of the Eastern half of the country would have less than normal rainfall. Mr, Palmer said statistics were against the breaking of the Southwestern drought in Texas, New Mexico and Ari zona. Records kept by the National Weather Service at Silver Spring show that in the past, whenever the Southwest has had a severe drought in ef fect on April 1, the drought has never been broken by June 1. Mr. Palmer said this did not hold true for South Florida, which has oceans on three sides. Droughts in Florida are almost always broken, or eased for many months, in late May or lune as monsoon type weather patterns take hold. The Central and South Flori da Flood Control District at West Palm Beach, said it was putting water into the Miami underground aquifer to pre vent the intrusion of salt water from the ocean and was turn ing about 16 million gallons of water a day into the Everglades National Park. Although the park is extreme ly dry, and birds and fish are dying by the hundreds and thousands, and many fires are burning in the park, the drink ing water situation in South Florida is not considered criti cal; and inland irrigation of pastures and citrus groves still continues in some areas. Florida's 1,000 or so Seminole Indians, some of whom are try ing to get cattle ranches start ed on their reservations north west of Miami, reported that their pastures were almost gone. Next to the Texas and Florida droughts, both labeled “severe” by the National Weather Serv ice, the drought in New Mexi co appears to he the worst. Parts of New Mexico have had as little as two one‐hun dredths of an inch of rain this year. But because New Mexico never gets much rain, as little as six inches during a year, the state is better equipped to deal with long dry periods than many other states are. Following is a summary of the conditions in some of the draught‐stricken states: New Jersey—Drought condi tions so bad this month that the Governor issued a procla mation April 22 closing all forests, woodlands and open spaces in the northern part of the state to the public. By that time 20,000 acres had been blackened by, fires. However, recent rains have eased the situation and Wednesday the Governor lifted the restrictions. New York—Brush fires on Staten Island and in Suffolk County brought out hundreds of firefighters. A spokesman for the National Weather Service here said half an inch of rain had fallen in the last week to end the drought threat. Arkansas—Many forest fires in recent weeks. Rainfall of nine inches so far this year is less than half of normal. No serious problem in agricultural crops because rain the last week has moistened the ground enough to allow planting. West Virginia—A thousand forest fires in recent weeks with damage to timber estimated at 4800,000. Half an inch of rain in the last week has lessened fire damage. Crops are just now being planted. Kentucky—Drought in in cipient stage. Rainfall about half of normal. The Ohio River, which normally floods in the spring, is well below flood stage. Forest fires burned over 5,000 acres of Kentucky River Basin. North Carolina —Unusually dry weather since last summer with intermittent wet spells. A corn loss of $25‐million last fall, but agricultural experts said this was a combination of drought and blight. Soybean loss of $7‐million. Many forest fires, one which burned over 28,000 acres near Stumpy Point, a fishing village of 400 resi dents on the coast. Near Cam den, in the western North Carolina mountains, hundreds of wild animals, deer, raccoons and black bear were trapped and destroyed in a fire as forest rangers tried to cut them a path to safety. Maryland—Drought caused a situation “approaching criti cally dry stage” in forests and smoking and open fires were banned in forests for two weeks. Rain Wednesday night eased the situation. Crops now being planted. Pennsylvania—The first rain in six weeks fell Wednesday. But amounts varied consider ably from two one‐hundredths of an inch in Pittsburgh to 43 one‐hundredths of an inch in Harrisburg. The state has aver aged 50 forest fires a day. Crops are just now being planted. Arizona—Only light rain “for months and months.” Cattle men are thinning their herds. Big cattle sales are starting a month earlier than usual. Camping has been curtailed in state and national forests be cause of fire hazards. Row crops are not hurting. In the Phoenix area, heavy rain last year left a two‐year supply of irrigation water in reser voirs. At Williams, a town of about 3,000 in northwestern Arizona, drinking water is al most exhausted. In the past, Williams has had to bring drinking water to town in rail road tank cars. There has been some blowing dust at Phoenix and Tucson. Indiana—Because of lack of usually heavy spring rains, farmers have been able to pre pare fields a week or 10 days early this year, and rain during the last week may have eased the drought threatening state forests.

51-> Commandos Based in Syria Increase Attacks on Northern Jordan
RAMTHA, Jordan, July 22—Syrian‐based Arab commandos stepped up their attacks on northern Jordanian border areas last night and today, despite statement by King Hussein that life had returned to normal in Jordan. Jordanian officials reported commando firing on four border villages since yesterday after noon. The incidents included the first guerrilla foray across the border into Jordan that has been officially reported since last week, when the King began his offensive against the commandos, or fedayeen. A Government spokesman re ported that the Jordanian forces massed here in the extreme north had made no move against the latest commando attacks, which seemed intended as re venge against the Jordanian re gime. But there was tension at this bustling border town on the border of Syria, where 5,000 or more fedayeen are deployed. “We will come back,” one commando said to a Palestin ian bystander as he and other youths set off across the border on foot. They had been among the more than 2,300 fedayeen whom the Jordanian Govern ment says it took prisoner dur ing the clampdown, which left the commando movement in Jordan crippled. The Government says it has already released 2,000 feda yeen. Only 39.of these are to be allowed to continue functioning as guerrillas in Jordan. Most of the others are officially said to have quit the commando movement and to be remaining in Jordan. Several hundred others have been expelled to Syria, Iraq and other Arab countries. As Saiqa and Al‐Fatah, the largest commando group, are the main guerrilla organiza tions in southern Syria, but it is not known here which group or groups has been harrying the Northern Jordanian vil lages.

53-> For Young Readers; Bear Circus By William Péne du Bois. Illustrated by the author. 48 pp. New York: The Viking Press. $4.95. (Ages 5 to 8)
Hurrah! A children's book without social significance. That's a rare thing to find today, But then William Pane du Bois is a rare artist‐author, one of the most talented and stylish creators of children's books. Let's give him a brisk ruffle of drums for his latest romp, “Bear Circus.” He is the perfect ring‐master, as all small children know who have been lucky enough to enjoy his “Bear Party.” In this new book the Koala bears are in danger of starving. A grasshopper plague has stripped “every leaf off every gum tree,” and it is kangaroos who carry the bears away to greener pastures. Just at that time a pink airplane, complete with a mini‐circus crashes on their new land supplying the ingenious Koalas with all the props necessary for a circus. And what a circus it is that the bears eventually put on out of gratitude for their friends the kangaroos. Fellini could well envy the acts: A Child's Garden of Bears, The Three Fur Brothers, The Great Mystery Bear, climaxed by the strong‐bear act called The All Babas. Perhaps the Behaviorists will be able to discover social significance in the plot of “Bear Circus”: Dr. Skinner himself can reason that the kanga roos’ enjoyment of all the fun was the “re‐enforcement” that he claims is the essential motivation for un selfish acts. But the children for whom this merry book was created, will find their delight unpolluted by any kind of significance. (They may well come to the same conclusion, by a sunnier route—that it's better to be unselfish because it turns out to be more fun for everybody.) So, it's Hurrah, Hurrah, for “Bear Cir cus!”

54-> Unions Say ‘It's Our Turn’
“It's our turn to roll the dice in the oldest established permanent floating crap game in America, and we're not going to stand still for the While House or anyone else.” That paraphrase from “Guys and Dolls” by a union negotiator sums up the mood of American labor as unions prepare to bargain this year for increased wages, pen sions and other benefits for 4.8 million workers in such key industries as steel, coal, longshore, construction and electric utilities. The Nixon Administration, convinced that the leapfrog of wages and prices repre sents the biggest current threat to the stability of the dollar, is hesitantly moving away from the hands‐off po sition toward wage settle ments that marked its first two years. But whatever brand of in come policy it adopts will run into fierce resistance from unions whose members have felt the twin pinch of higher living costs and shrunken work weeks with out sharing in the king‐size pay increases other unions negotiated in 1969 and 1970. Last year's twists of the wage‐price spiral fitted the doctrines of neither Adam Smith nor Lord Keynes. Unions chalked up the most sizable pay gains ever, in blithe disregard of the clas sic theory that a business downturn coupled with mass joblessness puts a damper on labor's bargaining power. The theory did hold in non union plants, where the rate of pay upturn was well below the 1969 level, ac cording to Commerce De partment figures. That disparity has not low ered the horizon of union ex pectation for 1971. On the contrary, industry charges that bulldozing by powerful unions is unbalancing the economy merely intensify the resolve of unions not to let their members become “fall guys” in a squeeze they blame on corporate greed and Administration bungling. Earned More, Bought Less In all nonfarm sectors of private employment, a group roughly one‐third organized, the 1970 story was a familiar one for the average wage‐ earner: He earned more and could buy less. His money wages of $121.03 a week were up $3.72 from a year before but, after allowance for higher living costs and taxes, the value of his earnings was down $1.59. Carrying the comparison through the last five years of inflation made the treadmill effect even more visible: The gain in money wages was $24.42 a week, the loss in purchas ing power $2.31. As usual, the building trades were far out in front of the wage parade last year, with first‐year pay raises as high as 22 per cent. Increases in factory wages were run ning at about one‐third that level until General Motors pushed the ante sharply up ward in November. The country's biggest manufac turer settled a 10 ‐ week strike on a basis that fixed a 13 per cent first‐year pat tern for the Big Three auto makers. The size of the increase in the second and third years will be determined by how successful the Administration is in checking inflation. The G.M. formula restored the un limited cost‐of‐living escala tor that the United Auto Workers gave up in 1967. That means auto wages will go up in tandem with the Federal Consumer Price index. In addition, the work ers will get a 3 per cent increase each year to reflect the long ‐ term growth in national productivity. What makes the General Motors contract of special importance is that its provi sions are bound to be an im portant determinant in the pay talks that overshadow all others in 1971. These cover 400,000 mem bers of the United Steelwork ers of America employed by 11 major steel producers. Fears of a strike when pres ent contracts expire this summer are already causing many steel‐dependent indus tries to make plans for stock piling all the metal they can store. Cooperation in Steel Despite the gloom that per vades most union and indus try comments, there are pow erful pulls toward a strike‐ free agreement in steel. In deed, if it were not for the element of rank‐and‐file mili tancy that makes all fore casts of labor peace hazard ous these days, the odds would be heavily against a strike. The steel industry has grown considerably in so phistication since it precipi ated a 116‐day strike in 1959 by seekng a free hand to abolish long‐established local work rules. The union's offi cial rhetoric still bristles with denunciations of the steel makers as “robber barons,” but it cooperates vigorously with the companies in many projects. In recent weeks both sides have been laboring on Capitol Hill to clamp tighter statutory restrictions on im ported steel. I. W. Abel. the union's president, serves on a special committee of the American Arbitration Association searching for ways to take the countdown element out of collective bargaining. The steel industry has repeatedly made plain its belief that ar bitration is the road to “peace with justice” in the forthcom ing talks. Membership coldness seems likely to rule out any serious consideration of that route for 1971. But the G.M. pat tern, plus contracts the steel union must negotiate this spring in the can and alumi num industries, should vastly reduce the danger of a strike confrontation in the steel mills. Novel Arbitration Idea A much more intense dan ger exists on the railroads, a constant trouble spot. Con gress, which passed three special laws last year to keep rail workers from striking, will probably have to pass a fourth one when the present truce runs out March 1. Much of the problem this time was caused by Congress itself. It stripped the carriers of most of their bargaining leverage by mandating a retroactive 13 per cent pay raise in its last stay‐on‐the‐ job law. The Administration will un doubtedly try to head off the March 1 crisis by renewing its unsuccessful 1970 plea for replacement of the 45‐year‐ old Railway Labor Act with a new law for handling na tional emergency disputes in all branches of transporta tion. A novel form of arbitra tion, do which a Presidential panel opts for the final posi tion of either management or labor, is at the heart of the Nixon plan. The President also can be expected to ask Congress for legislation to rationalize bar gaining in construction in hopes of putting a brake on the runaway wage movement there. Regional bargaining, in place of fragmented local talks, will be a feature of this plan. Mandatory wage and price controls are nowhere in the Administration's current thinking. Even guidelines keyed to productivity of the kind the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations used have few friends in the White House. “The way it looks we'll be swinging against empty air, and we'll be swinging hard,” is the union way of putting it.

56-> 2,383 Have a Gaelic Time at Feis Here
Under contentious skies that threatened misfortune but did not deliver it, 2,383 young peo ple of Gaelic persuasion gath ered at Lehman College in the Bronx yesterday to compete in 179 contests of dancing, music and declamation. There were 7‐year‐old boys singing “Dear Little Shamrock;” Irish choral groups, Scottish choral groups and Welsh cho ral groups. There were competitions for storytelling in the Gaelic lan guage for children under 12, and contests in accordion play ing, harp playing, flute and fife playing; in piano and violin, in war pipes and in elocution, con tests for ceilidh bands of ac cordion, fiddle and glockenspiel, and most of all there were the contests for dancers — thous ands of jiggers, reelers and hornpipers. For this was the 39th annual feis (pronounced fesh) spon sored by the United Irish Coun ties Association of New York. It had been scheduled for last Sunday, but the weather then had proved unwelcoming. Yesterday there were fears that attendance might be reduced be cause of a feis in Hartford and a hurling match with All‐Ire land players at Gaelic Park in the Bronx. There was also the chance that the day's humid torpor would condense into rain. All of this was groundless. The people came in thousands, with picnic lunches and beach chairs. The air was filled not with rain but with skirls of pipers and the clatter of spright ly quicksteps on the seven stages set up on the grassy north ern end of the campus. And by 11 o'clock in the morning John Cashin — who, his friends say, is 82 years old, although he looks to be on the green side of 60 — realized that the event of which he was chairman would come off fine. So, too, did Joseph Shelley, a printer who every year sells felt pennants with the names of each of the 32 counties that make up Ireland, North and South. “It's a big investment,” he said. “We have to mix the inks for the colors of every county — the orange in Armagh is very hard.” In most years Mayo pennants sell the best, said Mr. Shelley, himself Jewish with roots that go back to Eastern Europe. Mr. Cashin, a Tipperary man, and Peter J. O'Neill, who was born in Sligoe and is the pres ident of the United Irish Com, ties Association, took time out from greeting, directing and setting up chairs, to explain the purpose of the feis. “The primary purpose,” said Mr. O'Neill, “is to encourage the Irish arts and culture. There was a time when there were only a handful of places where children could learn the dances and the music. Now there are schools all over—in the suburbs, too. It seems that everyone is going back to their ethnic roots and it's not the melting pot anymore.” Mr. Cashin explained that the feis itself went back thou sands of years to the time when the kings of Tara con vened minstrels and poets in yearly contests. For Mary Brosman, who is 15 and studies weekly at the Peter Smith School of Irish Dancing, yesterday's feis was mostly just fun. She admitted to swelter ing in her embroidered black costume, and she said the three‐hour wait to perform was fretful. “But you know,” she added as she practiced some steps with other students from the Peter Smith School, “this is even more fun for us than for our mothers.”

57-> BATTRICK SCORES UPSET IN TENNIS
BOURNEMOUTH, England, May 22 (Reuters)—Unseeded Gerald Battrick won his first major tennis title today when he Upset Zeljko Franulovic of Yugoslavia in the final $36,000 British hard‐court (clay) cham pionships. The 23‐year‐old British Davis Cup player ran into trouble only in the third set, winning by 6‐3, 6‐2, 5‐7, 6‐0, before a capacity crowd of 5,000. Battrick collected $5,100 and Franulovic $3,000. Only a month ago, when the two met in a Davis Cup match at Zagreb, Yugoslavia, Franu lovic, one of the world's best clay players, lost only four games in crushing his rival in straight sets. Mrs. Margaret Court of Aus tralia, the grand‐slam cham pion, took the women's title by beating Evonne Goolagong of Australia, 7‐5, 6‐1. The 19‐year‐old Miss Goola gong, who is the only player to have beaten Mrs. Court this year, looked as if she might do it again, getting off to a 4‐1 lead. But Mrs. Court found her form and stormed back, losing only two more games. She re ceived $2,400 and Miss Goola gong $1,500. Mrs. Mary Ann Curtis of St. Louis and Francoise Durr of France won the doubles crown, beating Mrs. Court and Miss Goolagong, 6‐3, 5‐7, 6‐4.

58-> 119‐104 Setback 2d in Row
Life these days in the Na tional Basketball Association is not the romantic, winning ad venture that it used to be for the Knickerbockers. To the surprise and distaste of the players, their coach and most of 19,296 fans at Madison Square Garden last night, the Knicks were routed by the Los Angeles Lakers, 119‐104. It was the second straight decisive licking that the Knicks had taken in the early going of the season. On Tuesday, they dropped a 91‐84 decision here to the Detroit Pistons. Last night, after a poor first half in which they emerged trailing, 62‐52, the New York ers played superbly for one quarter, outscoring the Lakers, 37‐20, and took a firm 89‐82 advantage into the final 12 minutes. But with several players in foul trouble, forcing Coach Red Holzman to make many sub stitutions and play with a con stantly changing line‐up, the Knicks stopped moving and hitting. With Jim McMillian and Jerry West leading the way of fensively and Wilt Chamberlain and Leroy Ellis dominating the Knicks defensively, the Lakers ripped the Knicks, 37‐15, and turned the game into a one sided affair that drew boos from many of the departing fans. McMillian, a fogner Columbia star, led the Lakers with 28 points‐11 in the final period— by hitting 9 of 14 floor shots and 10 of 10 from the foul line. “He's a real smart player, not the flashy type, but he gets the job done,” Said Bill Sharman, the new Laker coach. “You don't realize usually how well he shoots until after the game when the final statistics are handed out.” Sharman has instituted an all‐out running game and has acquired the personnel to make it work. His fast, deep squad seemed full of life in the fourth quarter when the Knicks were going into their tailspin. The Lakers ran off streaks of 12, 10 and 9 points while holding New York scoreless and outscored the Knicks, 36‐9, in the first 10 minutes of the quarter. Bill Bradley, recovered from tendonitis in his right leg, start ed for New York and was one of the few players that Holz man had praise for afterward. He led the team in scoring with 17 points. The Knicks made only 37 per, cent of their shots, 41 of 109, and were routed at rebounding, 64 to 44. Chamberlain pulled down 19, moi'e than twice as many as any Knicks. Still seeking their first vic tory of the season, the Knicks left after the game for Cleve land, where they will oppose the Cavaliers tonight. The Cava liers, who posted the worst rec ord in the league in their first season, will be welcome op ?? ponents for the Knicks, who are trying to get one good game out of their obviously talented, but still disorganized, squad.

59-> Principal Opposes Reading Criterion Of Promotion Rules
An elementary school principal in a poor neighborhood in Brooklyn yesterday challenged district rules that, he said, arbitrarily denied promotion to 10 per cent of fifth‐grade pupils, those with reading problems. Nathan Davis, principal of Public School 174, brought suit in Federal Court to rescind those regulations, saying they were against the best interests of the children, and violated Constitutional guarantees of due process. Mr. Davis named as defendant Annette P. Goldman, acting district superintendent of District 19 in the East New York area. The district contains 22 elementary schools. Mr. Davis said in an interview that the regulations were patterned after flexible guide‐lines established several years ago by the central Board of Education. Local school boards were empowered, he added, to make adjustments in accordance with local experience on reading scores. Under regulations of District 19, the principal charged, a child may be promoted from Grade 5 to intermediate school (grade 6) only if he met one of the following criteria: ¶Attains a score of 4.3 on the reading test given in the spring of the school year. ¶Has been held over previously in the fifth or a lower grade. ¶Is learning English as a second language and has attended school on the United States mainland for less than two years. Mr. Davis contended that regardless of these criteria, principals had been instructed that not more than 10 per cent of the children in Grade 5 were to be held over, “The practical effect of the regulations,” he said, “is to require that in virtually every elementary school in District 19 a quota of 10 per cent of the children in Grade 5 are to be held over every year. The figure is an arbitrary one, chosen without regard to the needs, the welfare and the best interests of the children.” He noted that a child who was part of the 10 per cent quota in one school might read better than a child in a different school who was outside the 10 per cent quota. Mrs. Goldman, reached last night, denied Mr. Davis's interpretation of the rules, stating they did not lead to a quota of 10 per cent having to be held back in each school. She accused Mr. Davis of being a “believer in a 100 per cent promotion policy” and said the regulations were needed because “we were getting children in the sixth grade who were rmeading in the sixth grade who were reading on a second‐grade level.” The district's parents support the regulations, she said.

60-> AT HOME ABROAD
The revenue‐sharing debate is set in the wrong frame of reference. The policy change should focus on broad ening the availability to all levels of government—national, state and local —of contemporary abundantly yield ing tax sources. My own approach was developed during the Eisenhower Administration when the general vainly sought through the pressure of opinion at governors' conferences to get the Federal Gov ernment to return to the states and the localities those activities which they were able and willing to under take. Mr. Eisenhower failed in his ef fort to revive states' rights because he omitted from his reform equation the fiscal, or money, aspects. Today a long‐range proposed change of trend after nearly four decades of overcentralization of functions at Washington has been perverted by the immediate fiscal crises of states, cities and other local governmental entities. Thus, Mayor John Lindsay and Repre sentative Hugh Carey, Brooklyn Dem ocrat, specified that revenue sharing should represent new money and not merely constitute turning over to the states and localities of funds already allocated through grants in aid. In Congress even old‐line Southern Democrats, who were raised on “states' rights” with their pablum, think there is a Federal responsibility to supervise the manner in which states and their subdivisions expend “shared funds.” President Nixon has tried to steer a middle course by proposing a tran sition from Federal grasp of power to redistribution of authority to other levels of government—with $6 billion in new money and abolition of some 100 specific programs in favor of more loosely administered bloc grants. The dialogue already discloses a state of confusion. Instead of recog nizing fiscal reform as a change need ed to make the constitutional system of checks and balances workable in this radically changed period, men are raising irrelevant issues concerning whether state and local officials are competent and incorruptible. This ap proach implies that the overenlarged Federal bureaucracy can do no wrong. It seems to me that the choice lies between abandoning the constitutional system for fiscal reasons, on the one hand, and giving states and their sub divisions a larger portion of total tax able income, on the other. The rush to Washintgon for instant reforms was predicated on the fact of life that under the existing setup only Washington had access to revenues in virtually unlimited amounts. The re sultant overcentralizaticm not only up set the constitutional balance, but also resulted in waste, excessive over head, and increasing remoteness of government from the people. —President Nixon in his State of the Union Message If local self‐government and self respecting states are to resume their role under the American constitutional system, a better technique must be de vised for making revenues available to all levels of government. It seems to me that the best format would be for the Federal Government, on the one hand, and the states and the sub divisions, on the other, to make a com pact under the Constitution whereby a new tax collecting agency would col lect the specified revenues and redis tribute the proceeds in accordance with a preagreed formula to the var ious levels of government. Then each level of government would be responsible for honest and efficient administration, with no branch of government serving either as overlord or as Lady Bountiful. As in the past, mistakes would be made, and it would be up to vigilant voters to set standards of performance. The constitutional system under this plan would not break down through inability of states and localities to get a proper share of revenues collected. As activities were shifted back to the states and the localities, the Federal Government through forbearance and discipline should reduce its take of the total tax dollar to make room for the larger slice of other levels of government. The proposal has educational value since it would end the myth that the higher levels of Government are cornu copias with endless resources in treas ure. It would shock people into reali zation that the Federal Treasury, with its colossal debt, is an empty purse save for what it collects from taxpay ers in 50 states and thousands of cit ies, towns, villages, counties and school districts. To some it may come as a shock that there is no free lunch. The Federal Government, after free ing itself from disposable administra tive detail, can serve as a great service agency, a research center, a de veloper of goals and a coordinator of local units. In such a new tradition, it would be a step forward for Wash ington to deal respectfully with co ordinates in self‐supporting states and localities.

62-> Nixon Transfers 6 Miles of U.S. Beach to California
SAN CLEMENTE, Calif., March 31 — President Nixon today asked the Senate and House Armed Services Com mittees to approve the first in a series of nationwide moves to transfer billions of dollars worth of federally owned land to state and local gov ernments for recreational and other public uses. He an nounced he had directed Sec retary of Defense Melvin R. Laird to offer six miles of California's most valuable beâchfront, now part of the Marine base at Camp Pendle ton, to the state of California. In the planned series of na tionwide moves, state and local governments will be given the first chance to ac quire such lands free. Those lands not taken will then be offered for sale to commercial or industrial bidders. The proceeds from such sales would be earmarked for the land and water conservation fund of the Interior Department for use in developing new state or nation al parks. The Pendleton beach property is adjacent to the Western White House, but for security purposes there will be a buffer zone between the public beach and the President's own beach. Under the usual procedures for transferring excess Federal property, the two Armed Serv ices Committes can initiate leg islation within 30 days if either committee objects to transfer of the property. If the commit tees do not initiate such legis lation, according to White House officials, the transfer be comes final. Yesterday, as an interim measure, the Department of the Navy signed a lease agreement making some three miles of the beach available for immediate public use. This was a tem porary arrangement with the State of California undertaken in order to provide immediate public access to the beach area. White House officials said today's action was only a fore runner of other moves to trans fer Federal property, both urban and rural, to states and cities to use for parks, airport sites, fish and wildlife areas, schools, hospitals and other purposes. John D. Ehrlichman, assistant to the President for domestic affairs, said announcements would be forthcoming soon re garding properties in Long Is land, San Francisco, Seattle and several other areas. He did not identify the Long Island site except to say that It was not beachfront property. Meanwhile, in another de velopment, the White House re leased the text of a letter from the President to Wilbur D. Mills, the Arkansas Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. In the letter, Mr. Nixon in ef fect endorsed the committee's version of the welfare reform bill by saying that he approved various changes in the measure worked out in private confer ences involving the committee and his own negotiators from the Department of Health, Edu cation and Welfare. Among the most important of these changes are provisions that would provide 200,000 public service jobs, give the Labor Department clear respon sibility for the training, em ployment and eventual re moval from the welfare rolls of those recipients found to have “employment potential,” tighten up the bill's anti‐fraud provisions, and convert existing food stamp benefits to straight cash payments. The reform bill would replace the present Aid to Dependent Children program with a Fed eral income guarantee of $2,400 annually for a family of four, and provide various incentives designed to keep the so‐called “working poor”—those with only marginal income—at work and off the welfare rolls.

65-> ‘We Have to Choose Least of the Bad,’ Professor Says
SAIGON, South Vietnam, Oct. 2—Prof. Nguyen Ngoc Huy, who intends to cast his Vote for President Nguyen Van Thieu in the one ‐ man election tomorrow, knows that opponents of the Government have sonic legitimate complaints. But he insists that President Thieu, though he is the only choice is a good choice. “I am very sad about this one‐man show, but if Mr. Thieu resigns, the national situation will be quite mess,” said Mr. Huy, who is a lawyer and a teacher. He was a member of South Vietnam's delegation to the Paris peace talks. “If Mr. Thieu stays in power another four years, it is not the end of the long road of democracy, but if the Communists take over the South, then the road really stops,” the professor said. He spoke In Vietnamese and in French. Although many of the nation's seven million registered voters are expected to say yes to President Thieu tomorrow, for a variety of reasons, few of them spell out their reasons with the passion and clarity that this man employs. In the long living roomdining room of his villa, divided by shelves filled with Larousse's History of France and with knicknacks, Professor Huy, who is 47 years old, told how, all his adult life, he had been fighting the Communists. Then his voice took on a harsher sound. “The first priority for me as a voter is the Communist menace.” Professor Huy said. “We ask for too many things at the same time in Vietnam. We do not reflect enough on what our reality is. “Never is there a perfect democracy. Each country has its own problems. What can those who are critical of democracy in Vietnam say about the assassination of Robert Kennedy? Is that democracy? In a country (the United States) with 200 years of democracy? A man wanted to run for the presidency and he was assassinated!” This was the professor's rebuke to those American critics of President Thieu who resent the fact that he is the only candidate. Professor Huy, whose family is South Vietnamese, does not pretend that Mr. Thieu is without faults and that he has not made serious mistakes. “We have to choose the least of the bad possibilities,” the lawyer said. He says that there is “no guarantee” that Maj. Gen. Duong Van Minh, a popular rival who dropped out of the president election charging that Mr. Thieu had rigged it, could force the Communists to negotiate; Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky is described by the professor as “shallow, not serious.” “Think of Mr. Minh and his supporters—they all agree on only one thing: Opposition to Thieu,” Professor Huy said. “They could never among themselves agree on a constructive way to solve the nation's problems. How can such different types go together? They are like water and fire.” Professor Huy is the son of a civil servant who was a teacher during the French colonial regime. The professor attended a Saigon lycee and went to work at the age of 17 to support himself. His serious education began when he was working in national library set up by the Bibliothéque Nationale, the national library set up by the French, and was able, at last, to read books on politics. He remembers that as a happy time, though he was paid poorly and had to sleep on the library floor. In 1945, he joined the Dai Viet, a group named after the name by which the country was known to its people until the 19th century. This was an elite made up of some groups with connections to the imperial court at Hue and of young Vietnamese with Western education. He was drafted into the army, then controlled by the French, in 1053, and discharged two years later, after studying for his baccalaure ate degree. “The Dai Viet were always against the current,” Mr. Huy said. “In 1945, when everybody followed Mr. Diem, we were against him and were terrorized by his Government.” In 1955, he and his wife, who had been a midwife in Vietnam, were living in exile in Paris. They stayed there for eight years, until the overthrow of President Ngo Dinh Diem. Mr. Huy went to law school and to the Ecole de Science Politique, a prestigious school. His wife worked as a cashier, a cook, in a laundry and as a midwife. The Huys and some Vietnamese friends also opened a Vietnamese restaurant on the Left Bank. In 1965, he was appointed professor of political science in the National Institute of Administration here, where he now teaches. The student demonstrations and fire‐bombings last month disturb Professor Huy deeply. “I would say to these students, if I could speak to them,” he said. “‘Why don't you march in bare feet not ride on your motor bikes? Why don't you stop buying such modern clothes and dress as the peasants do?’ Don't they realize that 80 per cent of our needs are covered by American money?”

66-> Getting toned (by the Natives) in Staphorst
STAPHORST, the Netherlands—I must admit that I was a bit nerv ous about poking my curious American nose into the town of Staphorst since I had heard how they treated, or rather mistreated, tourists—throwing stones at them and smashing their car windows. So, for protection, I invited along two friends from home, Susan and her district attorney husband, Arnie, who happened to be in the Neth erlands at the time. Though sightseeing sounded a bit risky in this particular neck of the Dutch woods, Staphorst also sounded simply too intriguing to pass up. I had to come and see for myself whether this ancient town—which I had read had been settled as far back as 1217, yet was so secretive that most Americans weren't even aware of ‘its existence—was, in fact, alive and thriving in the province of Overijssel in the north‐central Netherlands. I had to see for myself how far the Staphorsters really would go to discourage tourists from what they regarded as spying on their odd ways. And I was curious, too, about what I had heard of their social customs. Was it true, for example, that a Staphorst woman who commits adul tery is punished by being driven through the streets in a manure cart while a boy has to impregnate his girlfriend before he is permitted to marry her? It took a little over two hours to drive the 120 miles that separate Amsterdam from this tiny town to the northeast. And while we noticed no sign that indicated that we had officially arrived in Stap horst, still, there was no question but that we had. To one side of Highway E‐32 a group of women stood in a tight chattering cluster. They wore old‐fash ioned Dutch costumes and their faces bore a look as cordially welcoming as the look on the face of a trod‐on rat tler. I made a sharp left turn off the high way right into the town—to all appear ances nothing but one long narrow street flanked by tiny, thatch‐roofed, two story homes which were huddled as closely together as the women on the corner. How quaint, I was thinking, but I had driven less than 100 feet down that picturesque street when, glancing into my rear‐view mirror, I saw that one of the costumed women was sprinting toward a parked car. The next thing knew she was rather ominously tail gating me. I picked up speed but she stubbornly stuck less than a foot be hind, further unnerving me by occasion ally swerving out into the other lane, honking her horn and blinking her head lights. Her fellow‐Staphorsters got the message—and fast. Seconds later, sev eral women came clomping out of their houses to glare at us and our rented car in a manner which clearly indicated that they bad not come from Welcome Wagon. Then suddenly I saw another car to my ,left. Driving on the wrong side of the road, the woman be hind the wheel was practically scraping the paint off my car as she calmly tried to squeeze me off the street and up onto the sidewalk. To add to my troubles, a little Staphorst girl—or maybe it was boy since, as I later discovered, all chil dren wear skirts here until they're 3 —appeared on my right walking directly into the path of my car. I jammed on my brakes and, swinging the car sharply to the left, avoided the child by a few feet and harassers by millimeters. I sat there shaking. I was trembling so violently that I couldn't even put the car in gear, until I saw up ahead that the Staphorsters were using this interval to mobilize. Pulling myself together, I was just starting off again when Arnie looked out the rear window and announced that a group behind us was forming up for our return. Through the rear‐view mirror I saw people standing on both sides of the road, jeering aryl. shaking their fists at us, while othere'were just sitting in their cars, waiting. “This street's a dead end,” Susan whispered hoarsely. “We could get trapped in here, and I don't like it at all.” Pelted‐With Stones Neither did I. I turned around—in time for our car to be pelted with pebbles and stones, splattered with mud, and derited by wooden shoes hurled by the furious‐looking bystanders. Even those who had been sitting in their cars now pulled out into the street one by one as we passed, honking horns that sounded like jeers and forming a hostile pro cession behind us that literally drove us right out of the picturesque town of Staphorst. We decided to park outside of town and venture in on foot at least as far as the “Staphorst Boerderij,” a farm house near the outskirts whose owners had the reputation of being friendly to tourists. Arriving at the farmhouse, we entered a spacious red and white room with the typical white and blue Dutch tiles on the walls and a display of post cards, pocketbooks, change purses, Bible covers—all of which had a distinctive Staphorst style—plus a variety of knick knacks. The owner, who spoke excel lent English, suggested we pick out some items to buy. Since his flow of informa tion about Staphorst slowed perceptibly whenever It looked as if we weren't going to buy, we took his advice. How ever, we also took care to pick out our postcards and other such odds and ends as painstakingly as if each one were precious jewel. We did not want to go broke while be talked, and we wanted him to talk a long time. From him, then, we succeeded in prying loose, purchase by purchase, the following story of A Different Dialect The Staphorsters—of whom there are currently just over 10,000—have scarce ly altered either their custorfis or cos tumes since they moved down from the northern coasts of the Zuider Zee, or possibly from the Frisian coast, around A.D. 1000. To this day these former fisherfolk who became farmers speak a dialect different from any other found In the Netherlands. They are furthermore set apart by their clannishness—partly the result of centuries of intermarriage, partly the result of their common ob sessive interest in religion. Staphorsters, who have been de scribed as more Calvinist than Calvin, engage in very few activities not specif ically sanctioned by the Bible. Thus, for example, they may not read maga zines or newspapers, play cards, throw parties or—though this matter is now being gravely reconsidered—watch TV. (Listening to the radio used to be banned as well, but this prohibition was re pealed some years ago.) Pious at all times, the Staphorsters—or more especially the nearly 75 per cent of them who adhere to the strictest of the numerous Dutch Calvinist sects—are conspicuously more so on Sunday. Dressing up in their striking black and silver Sunday outfits, they concentrate on their stern God all day, spending surprisingly short amount of their time in church and more hours in religious observances held en familia or in simply abstaining from the pleasures of this world. On Sunday their desire for pri vacy, merely vehement during the rest of the week (though Friday, we were to learn, was also an exceptional day), tends to become almost a fanatic religion in itself. Staphorsters setting out for church have been known to break their solemn ranks to smash a camera or a wind shield of an outsider who inadvertently or purposely ventured into town that day. To the Staphorsters, privacy—not cleanliness—is next to Godliness. Baths are taken only once a week and loiter ing in the tub is taboo since the Staph orsters believe that it is evil to ex pose the body. Even the barrel‐type tub in which the bath is taken is almost completely covered with canvas (except for a hole to enable the person to enter it), so that while the bather is bathing the lower portion of the body is hidden from the eye of the Devil (not to men tion the bather himself or anyone who might walk in). So anxious are the Staphorsters to maintain their privacy and to prevent others from finding out about their ways that, while the, women of Staphorst oc casionally work as maids in the near by town of Meppel, no outsider is per mitted to work or even enter the fields of Staphorst. While it is true that minute, fallen minority—such as our guilder‐hungry host in the Staphorst Boerderij—does associate with outsiders and will even capitalize on the towns people's secretiveness by revealing the secrets at a price of at least one dozen postcards, most Staphorsters shun the outside world like the plague. Those who commit the ultimate sin and marry outside the faith are not permitted to wear the Staphorst costume and gener ally walk either, to one side or to the rear of their costumed fellows when in a Look‐Anima After a millenium of inbreeding, one might reasonably expect most Staph orsters to get along with only a handful of shared last names, which they do, but also to look pretty much alike, which they also do. By and large, they have small chubby bodies (Staphorsters are so small that the men often escape being called up for military service), round faces, spaces between their teeth, half eyebrows, puffy cheeks, and very narrow eyes. In addition to looking alike, the majority of Staphorsters also dress the same. The men wear dark blue or black baggy pants and dark shirts, while the women wear long, dark, multi‐layered skirts and shirts and shoulder scarves which are either in the colorful Staphorst plaid or a somber navy blue if they are in mourn ing. Since the mourning period can last up to five years and since most Staph orsters are related and since even dis tant relatives may religiously observe the mourning period, most wear navy blue. To add to the general somberness of their appearance, the women's heads are always covered by unattractive tight blue caps, although some of the younger women sport decorative cloth‐and‐metal helmets from which dangle attractive gold coils strongly resembling—at least to the eyes of this wicked outsider—intra‐uterine birth control devices or IUD's. Birth control, however, is the least of these people's problems. If anything, be cause of their inbreeding and the re sultant sterility, their problem is pro ducing enough children. Obviously, any group which views the body as evil has one strike against them on this score. But to add to their difficulties, they also take the Ten Commandments very seri ously and if a couple breaks the sixth one, they are, indeed, driven, through the town in a manure cart to the Jeers of the morally outraged populace. In one case which occurred a few years back and which somehow leaked out to newspapers in the outside world, some 2,000 townspeople assembled as pious citizens broke down a middle‐aged woman's door In the middle of the night, dragged her. out of bed, threw mud and spat at her and generally abused her for five hours until she confessed to having committed. adultery. The man at the farmhouse told us, however, that such “entertainment” is not permitted on Saturday night since “the pleasure of jeering” might on too and dese crate the early hours of sober Sunday. Still, though the Ten Commandments explicitly forbid adultery, they have nothing to say against pre‐marital inter course—and neither do the Staphorsters. Their extravagantly liberal attitude on a. subject which most religious groups anxiously steer clear of is not, of course, based on any glorification of the body. (Their bathing customs are perhaps ample proof of this, yet there is also a piece of even more curious evidence apropos of their dread of the flesh and all that pertains thereunto: No under wear is permitted to be hung out on their laundry lines for fear that the sight might inflame the passerby with lascivious thoughts.) Pre‐marital inter course between young people consider ing marriage is encouraged for one purpose only: to discover if the girl can bear children. The Staphorsters’ chief occupation is farming and farmers want to make sure that there will be children around to help out on their farms and, when the time comes, to take over. (This custom of testing the girl to see if she's fertile is by no means unknown in other traditionally rural parts of the Netherlands. What's surprising is to find such goings‐on still going on in an other A Rustic Start A few decades ago, the Staphorst mating ritual usually got off to a rustic start when a girl allowed a boy to carry her shopping bag home from market with her. Nowadays, with cars and bi cycles to take care of transport prob lems, the ritual usually begins in—of all places—church. A Staphorst boy de clares his intentions by a conspicuous, pew‐to‐pew ogle. Actually, this site for a generally secular activity is not as strange as it seems since church is about the only place where Staphorsters of all ages regularly congregate. For the par ents of the girl, the fact that the first steps in courting take place where they do has its advantages, for by repeatedly ogling in church the boy makes his choice public. The result is that he would have a difficult time if he tried later to evade his marital responsibili ties by claiming that some other young swain was responsible for the baby. In fact, should the boy try to avoid the marriage arter the girl has become preg nant, the townspeople have been known to get out the old manure cart once again, drive him through town in it and then rough him up until he publicly Some years back, the next step in the courting process was carried out in a colorful manner, but one which has since been abolished. The wooing boy whose glance had been answered in church had to wait for the following Friday for the fun to begin. That was the evening hallowed by tradition for paying his call on her. Leaning ready for use against her house he could ex pect to see a “courting ladder” which would take him right up to the second story “courting window.” About one half the size of all the other windows, this one had blue shutters while all the rest were green. And, as a final pre caution against the risk of his entering the wrong window, a blue hex sign marked the spot. Before setting foot on the bottom rung, the suitor was expected to announce his arrival by loud, clear whistle, and he was also expected to dangle one foot at a certain point so that the girl's parents, sitting in the ground floor living room, could reach out and haul him down at the last moment. Only a suitor with enough money or land was allowed to continue A Kiss at the Summit Having passed that test, he faced yet another as he reached the top of the ladder. If he was not met with an en couraging kiss, he was duty‐bound to climb right back down again. If the kiss was forthcoming, in he went to join the girl on her parents’ big double bed. Subsequently, if the girl failed to show signs of being pregnant—and all eyes were on the lookout—she could expect nothing but derision. Even quite recently there have been instances of a boyfriend setting up a scarecrow on his ex‐girlfriend's lawn and of the towns people tossing rubbish at its straw feet. In the good old days, the couple was married as soon as pregnancy had been clearly established. Nowadays—perhaps as further assurance that the line will continue—the boy and girl continue to live with their own parents until the baby is horn. Their long‐postponed mar is then cause for celebration in Staphorst and during the wedding cere mony the newborn baby is proudly exhibited, stark naked, to family and friends. “Flow do the young folks go about their courting these days?” I asked, buying yet another knickknack to prime our narrator's pump. “Well, it's Friday night, so you might just ask them yourself. I wouldn't rec ommend visiting the town tonight, though. Staphorsters can be unpleasant to outsiders, but on the Sabbath and on Friday night which is still tradi tionally a very private night they could even become a bit vicious.” “You're telling me,” I said, and de cided not to mention that we had al ready seen a sample of their hospitality that afternoon. “But even if it wasn't Friday night,” he went on, “I still would not recommend you go farther into town than here at this time. Things are changing here these days and the people are very unhappy about it. The new highway has just been completed and it cuts right through the town. The street you're on now is only one half of Staphorst, and on the other side of the highway are most of their farms. They have been able to maintain their privacy for centuries and now suddenly they have to cross a highway to get from their farms to their homes.” (I suddenly understood why those women had been standing on the cor ner when we first approached town.) “And, of course, they are now left wide open to the outside world,” our informant continued. “People stop for a look and some have tried to take pictures of them and this the Stap horsters don't like any more than you would like it if some stranger drove up and took a picture of you. Now there's a police regulation against taking people's pictures here without getting their permission first. But some visitors go out of their way to ask for trouble. They try to sneak right into the town.” Susan, Arnie and I exchanged a guilty glance. “To make things even worse,” the owner told us, “one of our Dutch maga zines has just published a story on Staph orst so that all this past week people have been driving here from all parts of the country. These last few days the Staphorsters have been touchier than I've ever seen them before. Still, I sup pose it's just a matter of time before other magazines find out about us so even more people will come to Stap horst.” “And you,” he said; pointing’ at me, “you've been taking notes since you came in here. Are you a writer also?” I nodded. “American?” “Yes.” “Well, then I guess that's the end for them,” he said. “Oh, I don't know. about that,” I said defensively. “It could be just the be ginning. After all, we have a group in America called the Amish and they were once a secret group like the Staphor sters. Some of them have come out into the open now Many of the older ones still keep to their former ways, but some of the others have opened their farmhouses to paying guests and they have greatly improved their standard of living.” Tourist Inroads We all argued for a time about the subject of what opening up to the out side world did to such groups until finally our host said, “Maybe you're right. Already I have seen a few in dications that the tourists may be able to help us. Our people are not rich and they could use some money from the outside. Tourists are beginning, to pay to take pictures and some of the young er folks let them and, around here, every little bit counts. And some of our people act a bit strange because maybe they've married into each other's families too long, so there, too, having to deal with people from other parts of the country may do some good. “Since that article came out, the people have started asking for things like television. They've asked the preach er and he's still making up his mind. No, I suppose the old ways don't always have to be the best.” This idea then seemed to take root in his head and blossom out and he started to talk louder and louder and faster and faster as mo're and more ideas popped into his mind. “And may be the next time you come here,” he said, “there will be a big hotel right outside of the town, and maybe I will get a concession in the hotel, and maybe they'll have guided tours through Staphorst, and maybe our young girls will start marrying people who come just for a look and then can't leave, and maybe...” And maybe the demonic power of the floating guilder and the bobbing dollar will mark the end of the secretive ways of Staphorst.

67-> PRINCETON PRIZE TO MRS. STEPHENS
PRINCETON, N.J., May 22— Mrs. Lois Stephens of Ossining, N.Y., who started riding only five years ago in the hope of strengthening an injured knee, captured four classes including the prestigious Grand Prix to day at the Meadow Mouse dressage horse show. The event attracted 83 riders in its 11th Renewal. The first show in 1961 drew an entry list of 12. Mrs. Stephens, whose hus band, Claude, serves as chair man of the board of the Texas Gulf Sulphur Corporation, was up on Fasching in her triumph in the Grand Prix. She rode Arcadius to the blue in the Intermediate and Feodosia to victories in two lesser classes. ?? Col. Bengt Ljungquist, a re tired former Swedish Army of ficer who was instrumental in developing many dressage rid ers in Europe, judged the Grand Prix and gave Mrs. Stephens a score of 311, high by any stand ards. The perfect score for the Grand Prix, which includes 50 ‘tests, is 500. “I'm very pleased at the score,” said Mrs. Stephens, who intends to enter the Pan‐Amer ican Games dressage tryouts at Lake Erie College next month. “But this is the first time the present tests have been used in this country in the Grand Prix.” The Federation Equestre In ternationale, the world govern ing body of equine sports, changed some of the tests and sequences of movements in the Grand Prix this year. They were not considered major switches, but in the Grand Prix, where every movement must be care fully weighed, they were highly significant to the riders. “The changes actually seemed to make the going a little better from my point of view,” said Mrs. Stephens. “They enabled Fasching to get limbered up right at the start.” Mrs. Stephens said she never had seen a dressage ring until 1966. At that time she had un dergone three operations on her right knee. Her physician told her she could ride, so she de cided to try dressage. “It must have helped,” she said, “because the knee never bothered me again. Now I ride six or seven horses a day a total of about seven hours. We have built an indoor arena at our farm, Starbrook. It's air conditioned and we keep it at a temperature of about 50 de grees all the time.” John Winnett of Tuxedo Park, N. Y., who spent part of last year studying dressage in Germany, finished a strong sec ond behind Mrs. Stephens in the Grand Prix on Sovereign with a score of 286. Winnett also was second to Mrs. Stephens in the Intermedi are, also on Sovereign. This was extremely, close, with Mrs. Stephens finishing with a score of 186 to 185 for Winnett. Kie Johnson of Chester Depot, Vt., defeated Mrs. Stephens and Arcadius in the Prix St. Georges event. Miss Johnson scored 248 points to Mrs. Stephens's 244. Mrs., Donnan Plumb of Chesa peake City, Md., who competed hi the dressage event in the 1968 Olympics for the United States, was third on Iron Bar with a score of 239.

68-> WORLD OF SEVENTH AVE.
Risk and uncertainty are ingredients of the fashion and textile industries. But, like the mills that weave denim, those turning out corduroy, one of the most versatile in the broad spectrum of tex tiles, seem to have an as sured and growing market for their product. John S. Thompson, presi dent of the Crompton‐Rich mond Company, a leading producer of corduroy, points out that, in the minds of young people, it has the same connotation as denim, a fab ric that has its roots in work clothes, the good earth and the new breed of intellec tuals. Charles A. Reich, a pro fessor of law at Yale Uni versity, in his best‐seller, “The Greening of America,” talks about the “new” clothes that young people wear. “They express an affinity with nature; the browns, greens, and blues are na ture's colors, earth's colors, not the colors of the ma chine, and the materials are rough and tactile.” He says the blue jeans and other unostentatious clothes give the wearer free dom to do anything he wants. “He can work in them, read in them, roll down a hill in them, ride a bike in them, play touch football, dance, sit on the floor, go on a camping trip, sleep in them. Above all, they are comfort able.” “Corduroy,” Mr. Thompson said recently, “is the most versatile fabric in the textile kingdom, You can find it in anything from a $300 eve ning cape to a $1.98 pair of rompers — in men's smoking jackets and now in black cor duroy tuxedos. There has been a revival of the Norfolk jacket, and clothing manu facturers are making sleeve less two‐piece outfits for men called the ‘easy suit.’” Printed corduroy, he went on to say, has become popu lar for the more sophisticat ed wearer in jeans and flairbottom slacks. Solid colors are in demand by cap and vest manufacturers. Crompton, in addition to weaving corduroy, is the only American producer of velvet een. Other large corduroy manufacturers are Cone Mills, Inc., and Greenwood Mills, Inc. Total corduroy production do the United States last year was 185 million yards, 37 per cent more than the yardage turned out in 1969, but still under the peak year of 1967, when the industry produced 190 million yards. The course that weaving for durable press has taken in corduroys is an indication of the growing use of the fabric in casual wear, where pressing is not extremely im portant. The 1967 production jump was sparked by the advent of durable press. The industry started turning out corduroy made of 50 per cent cotton and 50 per cent polyester fi ber. These blends accounted for 25 per cent of total pro duction in that year. Since then, the trend has been back to all‐cotton con duroys that are not treated and the total of durable‐press fabric has receded to 6 per cent. Corduroy, like denim, is in strong demand. Mr. Thomp son noted that the company's output was sold through Sep tember. Other manufacturers are also booked up well ahead. These goods require a cer tain expertise and, for this reason, mills hesitate to start up a corduroy operation. Mr. Thompson estimated that total corduroy consumed amounted to about 225 mil lion yards annually. This would include about 36 mil lion yards imported in the form of apparel, and a limit ed amount of the fabric it self. Corduroy derives its name from the French “corde du roi,” cloth of the king, which leads to the supposition that the fabric was originated in France. But some textile his torians credit the British with having invented it. The Crompton Company imported the machinery to produce the fabric in 1885 and began the first integrated production in Crompton, R. I. Now its corduroy and vel veteen facilities are concen trated in Virginia, Arkansas, Georgia and North Carolina. Before World War I, it was used mainly in work clothing and boys' knickers and as the basic upholstery fabric for baby carriages. It also was the cloth that covered seats in the Model T Ford. With the advent of softer finishes, corduroy went into apparel designed for girls' and wom en's wear. With the development of pinwale corduroys, those that show 16 ribs to the Inch, and which now constitute the ma jor portion of total output, the fabric came into wide use in infants' and children's wear. The wide‐wale corduroys, with seven or fewer ribs to the inch were introduced into men's outerwear in the mid 1950's for such items as car coats and rainwear. Midwales, with 14 ribs to the inch; are a major con struction used in jeans and slacks. Corduroy and velveteen fall into the category of fabrics on which a pile effect is achieved by cutting tightly woven lengthwise loops. In velveteen the loops are so close together that a solid pile effect results after cut ting. In velvet the fabric is woven into a double thick ness and the connecting threads are severed to form two layers of cloth with ver tical pile.

70-> TRUCK HIJACKING: START TO FINISH
The arrest of four men in Queens and the recovery of about $40,000 worth of hijacked clothing disclosed early yesterday morning some of the intricacies of the highly organized and booming hijacking racket in the metropolitan area. Detectives said that the clothing hijacking began in Brooklyn last Thursday, went into Long Island and back into Queens and that it started with a major crime organization of the Long Island area and included a variety of subordinate operations. “It's hard to say at this point which mob was in charge,” said Detective John Tartaglia of the Queens District Attorney's office. “These big organizations sometimes borrow workers from one another for a particular job, but it was one of the top criminal organizations of the Long Island area.” The actual hijacking began shortly before noon last Thursday when a truck filled with children's wear was hijacked on 20th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues in South Brooklyn. For two and a half hours the driver of the truck was driven around Brooklyn and Queens and finally let out in Hempstead, L.I., unharmed. Meanwhile, the clothes were being, transfered to another truck and the hijacked vehicle was ahandoned in Long Island City, Queens. The next phase was for the hijackers or others connected with them and the major crime organization to find buyers for the stolen merchandise. It was while this was going on, according to the police, that they an across the trail of the criminals. While agents for the criminal organization were looking for customers, the truck with the stolen merchandise was “stashed away in Brooklyn,” according to one of the detectives. They refused to say where. The operation to track down the stolen merchandise was assigned to Assistant District Attorney Anthony V. Lombardino, chief of the organized crime bureau in the office of Queens District Attorney Thomas J. Mackell. They learned that the buyers had been found and would be waiting for the shipment on Friday night at the Surfside Three Motel, at 164‐33 Cross Bay Boulevard, in the Howard Beach section of Queens. About 7 P.M. on Friday, when the truck arrived, Mr. Lumbardino and Detectives Tartaglia, Harold Lipton, John Votto, Jerome McGowan and Victor Juliano were in the vicinity in two cars and a truck. The receivers of the stolen property—one of them, the police said, the nominal owner of the motel—took off in the truck and in a Cadillac that stayed in the background. For more than an hour, the truck, followed by the Cadillac, wound through the residential streets in what the police called “evasive action” to see if they were being followed. About 8 P.M. the truck pulled up to the curb at 97th Street and 58th Avenue, in Howard Beach, a mere half‐mile from the starting point. The Cadillac came alongside and a different driver took the wheel of the truck. At this point, the police said, they became concerned that the men in the Cadillac had discovered they were being followed. So they drove up with guns drawn and made the arrest. There was no resistance and no weapons were found. The men charged with criminally receiving stolen goods, were: Thomas Stabile, 31 years old, of 588 Essex Street, Brooklyn; Michael Galgano, 49, and his son Michael Jr., 21, who said they were carpenters living at 105‐30 75th Street, Ozone Park, Queens; and Joseph Luccisano, 37, of 97‐16 158th Street, Howard Beach, Queens, said to be owner of the Surfside Three Motel. The police said that the investigation of the hijacking was continuing and that among the points they still had not cleared up was who originally owned the merchandise.

71-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: Lester Markel believes that an inde pendent, well‐funded, innovative pub lic TV, once it is weaned from “Capi tol Hill and Corporation Heights,” could make average citizens more knowledgeable. [Op‐Ed July 8.] Granted there may be 40 per cent of the population “uninformed but willing to learn,” one wonders bleakly what degree of willingness must be inferred from the qualifying phrase, “if the task is made easy enough.” Does it follow that a reformed public TV will spur the citizen to action only if involvement is comfortable enough? Meanwhile, back at the super‐heeled, talent‐studded ramparts of commercial television, the corporate dynasties whose advertising budgets keep the networks in business would hardly be resting easy in the saddle. An aware, well‐informed public is anathema to vested interests, who would press on to prevail through the profitable art of mass seduction. Unhappily, it is doubtful that aver age citizens, conditioned as they are to being mindlessly amused, pampered and palliated by their TV sets, would be any more receptive to reliable sources of disturbing, truthful report age than are their ignorant or moronic cousins.

72-> EXACTA NOT TOPIC, TRACK AIDE SAYS
A Yonkers Raceway director Who chatted in the track's din ing room with Nicholas (Cock eye Nick) Rattenni shortly be fore a suspicious exacta race on June 7 denied under oath 68 stevday that he had any “im proper association” with the re puted Westchester County un derworld boss. The executive, Sidney Roth, 68‐year‐old vice president from Manhattan, told the State Har ness Racing Commission that he had never even played golf with Rattenni. “He told us he had engaged in conversation with Rattenni,” Robert Glasser, the commission chairman, reported after a one hour closed inquiry. “He told us the nature of the conversa tion. He said it didn't pertain to the exacta race.” Gates Closed to Seven The race, in which a 13‐1 winner and a 9.2 runner‐up produced a payoff of only $42.60, resulted in an apparent betting coup for insiders. A Fed eral grand jury is continuing its investigation into this and other harness races suspected of being fixed. Seven trainer‐drivers have been temporarily banned from Roosevelt Raceway pending the outcome of the investigations. The seven, including such top drivers as William (Buddy) Gil mour, Carmine Abbatiello and Ben Webster, reportedly are having difficulty securing stall space for their horses at other tracks. Daniel P. Hollman, chief of the Joint Federal Strike Force Against Organized Crime, de clined yesterday to identify witnesses being called by the grand jury. However, the indi cation was that Roth would be called soon. Roth came to Yonkers in 1954 as a public‐relations man. He became a vice president earlier this year when Stanley Tananbaum assumed the presi dency. Before that Roth had been a $30,000‐a‐year director specializing in public relations. He owns 13,000 shares of Yon kers Raceway stock currently worth $416,000. Representing the commission at the inquiry in its offices at 820 Second Avenue were Glas ser, Henry Curran, a commis sioner, and Bertram Sarafan, the commission's attorney. James A. Farley, the other com missioner, is vacationing in Eu rope. Glasser said the questioning was confined to “matters of as sociation,” and that the inves tigation would continue. “We're going to check into his answers,” the chairman said. “A determination of an improper relationship would depend on circumstances.” Rattenni, also known on the links as Nick Perry, is referred ‘to as the “garbage czar” of Westchester County because of his operation of refuse compa nies. He is currently under in dictment on three counts charging loan‐sharking, con spiracy to bribe Internal Rev enue Service agents and par ticipation in a $60‐million‐a‐year gambling ring. Though he was welcome at Yonkers on June 7, he has now been barred from all New York harness tracks at Glasser's in struction. But Sarafan caution ed against hasty conclusions. “I don't think there's proof he's bad man. He had one criminal conviction, for robbery, in 1927. That was more than 40 years ago.”

80-> Midwest Stock Exchange Automates Paperwork
While the New York Stock Exchange worried last week about what the surge in trad ing volume might do to the back‐office operations of its member fims, the Midwest Stock Exchange came to town offering what it termed a solution. The Midwest Stock Ex change Service Corporation has become unobstrusively the largest data‐processing complex exclusively serving the nation's brokerage indus try. The Midwesterners are not interested only in serving their own 353 member firms but anyone who needs help in controlling the paperwork problem. The exchange's service corporatioh is pro viding 92 brokerage firms with its Automated Book keeping Service, which com puterizes all in house, back office operations from con firmations to margin anal yses to purchase‐and‐sales blotters. The service covers all listed and over‐the‐count er stocks. It processes about 35,000 trades a day and has handled 50,000 trades. It currently is processing about 20 per ent of the nation's securities transactions, according to Da vid R. Rubin, president. Mr. Rubin believes his op eration can double its 2 mil lion customer accounts with out any strain. He explained the other day, “We designed the system with expansion in mind and can triple vol ume in a matter of six months.” The 92 brokerage firms us ing the service have more than 600 branch offices. They range in size from concerns with little more than 100 trades a day to large houses such as Blair & Co., Inc.; Thomson & McKinnon, and Smith, Barney and Co. The firms are scattered from coast to coast, including 11 New York houses. They are linked to a central data processing site in Chicago by a high‐speed communications system. Member firms transmit their information on cash and securities movement over the communications system. Aft er this information is proc essed in Chicago, confirma tions are printed on termi nals located in brokerage of fices and linked directly to Chicago computers. Confirmations are returned to the broker on the same day the transaction takes place so they can promptly be mailed to customers, Larg er and bulkier reports are flown early each morning to the brokerage firms. The service corporation uses about 30 computer sys tems and employs approxi mately 225 persons. Besides the Chicago computer cen ters, the system has addi tional computers in New York, Dallas and St. Louis. The New York computers handle about 25 per cent of the system's total transac tions. The Midwest Stock Ex change's success in its ef forts to create automated systems for member firms is the result of both serendipity and common‐sense planning, according to industry sourc es. The service corporation was organized in 1961. Je rome Brien, vice president of the Midwest Stock Exchange Clearing Corporation, who has been with the computer service operation since its inception, commented,” “From the beginning, we re alized that volume would rise substantially and that automation was the only so lution to the problem. Since some of our member firms were small, they couldn't af ford to do the job them selves. A joint effort was a necessity.” The service organization Is non‐profit. The money is ploughed back into research and development of other systems.

81-> ALLENDE BACKERS ATTACKING PRESS
SANTIAGO, Chile, Oct. 2—Chile' President, Dr. Salvador Allende Gossens, is proud of his record of defending freedom of the press. His followers, however, are trying to discredit newspapers, magazines and radio stations that oppose the Government's political point of view. Last weekend the President withdrew his publicly announced decision to close the Santiago office of United Press International for the news agency's supposed part in an alleged international plot to undermine Chile's leftist Government. Simultaneously newspapers and student organizations that support the Government increased the violence of their steady attacks on opposition communications media. President Allende, a leftist whose aim is a socialist revolution without violence in Chile, has vigorously denied charges from abroad that his 10‐monthold Government has restricted press freedom. In fact, newspapers, radio news programs and television news and commentary programs in Santiago show greater freedom in expressing a wide range of views than those of several other South American countries, including Brazil and Peru. Dr, Allendes decision to close the local office of United Press International, which he announced in a speech to union members, was the first direct attack on freedom of expression under his Government in Chile. The President said at the time that he had decided to close the bureau because of various articles the agency had issued from outside Chile in recent weeks. United Press International, the President's office announced, will he permitted to continue its gathering and distributing of news in Chile but Martin Houseman, chief of the Chilean office, will not be permitted to continue as the agency's head. The day after Dr. Allende's speech, Interior Minister Jose Gonzalez Tohá told a delegation from the Santiago Foreign Correspondents Association that the Government was bent on punishing U.P.I. but had nothing against Mr. Houseman. “The Government of Chile once again affirms its aim to facilitate the full exercise of unrestricted freedom of the press and information, as well as its firm decision to watch over the dignity, the prestige and the interests of the country,” the Government statement on U.P.I. said. The Government, however, apparently did not call off its current campaign against El Mercurio, a conservative daily newspaper with the largest national circulation in Chile. Rectangular red bumper stickers have appeared on the streets stating: “Chilean: El Mercurio lies.” The stickers are conspicuous on the walls of the presidential press office. A Communist‐controlled newspaper that supports the Government reported that the license of Radio Presidente Balmaceda, owned by the opposition Christian Democratic party, would soon be revoked for irregularities. The radio station's night talk shows have been under attack in the same newspaper.

82-> Banana Split
The Port of New York, limping back to life under pressure of a temporary court order after eight weeks of strike shutdown, has permanently lost one of its commercial mainstays. The United Fruit Company has abandoned the Weehawken terminal it opened two dec ades ago and is now using Albany and Baltimore as distribution centers for the millions of bananas it used to bring to this port from Central and South America. The snakelike conveyors which the company designed for cradling bananas when they were shipped on the stem and required extreme care in unloading became obsolete when the industry switched to boxed bananas. The prospect of heavy investment for new automated pier equipment prompted United Fruit to reassess its whole distribution pattern to determine whether wanted to stay here. Its decision that it could reach major markets more cheaply by transferring from ship to truck in Albany, even though that same decision entailed the heavy extra expense of bringing large quantities of the cargo back to the metropolitan area, cannot easily be shrugged off by any of the groups whose economic well‐being depends on the vitality of the Port of New York. The company denies that the featherbedding practices and the abuses of wage guarantees fostered here by the International Longshoremen's Association were a primary factor in its decision to quit the port. Yet it is significant that United Fruit did not even attempt to explore with the Port Authority the possibility of obtaining its help in modernizing facilities. High labor costs and sleazy work practices, coupled with off‐dock traffic congestion and other handicaps to efficient terminal operation, inevitably impel cost‐con scious businesses to question whether the natural mag nificence of New York's harbor and the richness of its market are worth the price in money and annoyance. Union‐enforced limitations on manpower mobility often confront employers with great difficulty in filling the pier jobs that are available. In the last year, 1,185 long shoremen in this port drew $9,500 each in guaranteed annual income without ever working one minute. On top of that, the industry had to contribute roughly $2,500 in pension, welfare and other fringe benefits for each these non‐working workers. The wage‐guarantee fund was a pioneering adaptation to cargo containerization; but perversions in its application can kill the port unless the union faces up to the necessity for wiping out the abuses that have converted it from boon to menace.

84-> Ex‐Commuter Counts Sheep for a Living
ELVERSON, Pa. — What's a city slicker doing on a sheep farm 45 miles from the big town? Eric Flaxenburg explained that It was what he'd always wanted to do. Besides, he married a farmer's daughter. “When I was a kid growing up in Philadelphia, I used to say I wanted to go to agricultural school,” he related. “Everybody laughed. There were no farmers in my family. Maybe it was Western movies. I had this thing about wanting to raise cattle.” But he got sidetracked, went to the University of Pennsylvania and became a teacher, putting in a three‐year stint teaching English at the University of Puerto Rico. He was back in Philadelphia working on his doctorate when he got sidetracked again. His father, who owns the United Packaging Company, had a strike at his plant and enlisted his son as a truck driver. “Then I had a meteoric rise to vice president,” Mr. Flaxenburg continued. “I hadn't been especially happy teaching, so I stayed.” And there he might still be if he hadn't met the farmer's daughter. Jean Flaxenburg, born on a farm near her present home, had come to the big city to be a fashion designer and used to walk her dog at the same time he walked his. What they both wanted was to live on a small farm and agreed to set their wedding date when they found one. “I bought a motorcycle and a lot of maps,” said Mr. Flaxenburg, a husky, bearded man of 42. “Every weekend, we rode around looking at farms.” Five years ago, they found an 18thcentury stone farmhouse on 40 acres in Chester County, near the French Creek State Park. Recently, with its pond glistening in the crisp autumn sunshine and brilliant foliage on the surrounding hills, it looked like a Grandma Moses painting. The couple were married, moved in and set about remodeling the house, which, oddly for a farmhouse, had no fireplaces. Nearby Hopewell Village (now a National Historic Monument) had been an iron center, and the house had used Franklin stoves for heating. At first, the Flaxenburgs had no idea about raising anything but children on their farm. They have a good start on that with Seth, 3½, Rachel, 2½, and Jesse, 16 months. (Mrs. Flaxenburg is pregnant again.) While Mr. Flaxenburg continued to commute almost 100 miles a day to his job in Philadelphia, he dreamed about being a true farmer instead of a traffic fighter. Knowing nothing at all about animal husbandry, he first considered cattle but was told that sheep were easier to raise. Besides, he had understood that the previous owner of the farm had raised sheep, and in his innocence, thought the barn was set up for sheep. (He found out later that the man had achieved some local fame raising fighting cocks.) Mr. Flaxenburg read everything he could on sheep raising and talked to neighboring sheep farmers. He then started with six ewes and a ram, a playful creature called Butch who wears a bell to warn visitors not to turn their backs on him and risk being sent flying into the air. Although the flock now numbers 40, it was soon obvious that raising a small herd for wool, meat and hides was not enough to support a family of five. Plus an enormous Irish wolfhound, named Horse, a Kerry Blue terrier called Bridget, and Barney, the Border collie who is supposed to be a sheep dog, but has all the wrong instincts. The farm also houses two horses and an indeterminate number of cats. Three years ago, Jean Flaxenburg came on the solution almost by chance. She made a bunting for Seth from one of the sheepskins and it was much admired. So she made more for friends. Her husband took some samples to a New York department store, which sold them at triple the price and then took eight months to pay. “I hated being a salesman. The stores made me go in the back door,” he said ruefully. Jean Flaxenburg tried her hand at making children's coats, then adult ones, buying the skins from outside sources. The French Creek Sheep and Wool Company was founded in the barn, which is used both as a work area and a salesroom. Three women from nearby areas help make the coats, sometimes bringing their children to play with Seth and Rachel during the day. Jean Flaxenburg, a small 30‐year‐old who works in blue jeans and a hunting shirt, is designer and cutter. Her husband takes care of the business end, doing the advertising and the bookkeeping, in between playing midwife to the sheep or shearing them —“just say I'm the boss.” A good deal of the company's business is mail order, via advertisements or an illustrated brochure. Some customers drive to the farm to see things for themselves. The sheepskin coats (skin side outside, fur side inside) sell for between $135 to $195, but the Flaxenburgs point out that they're virtually indestructible. Seams are reinforced, buttonholes are leatherbound. “We make them as we would for ranchers,” Mr. Flaxenburg explained. This year, Eric Flaxenburg gave up the grueling commuting and is now devoting all his time to the farm. Watching Seth bellowing at the sheep and trying to herd them with his crook, he looks happy. But there's still a sort of John Wayne squint to his eyes as he talks about the ultimate dream of a real ranch with thousands of sheep in Wyoming or someplace, “You get awfully fond of sheep.”

86-> Eastern Patriarch Defends Ordination of Married
ROME, Oct. 2—Leaders of Eastern rite Roman Catholic churches vigorously challenged Western attitudes toward priestly celibacy during opening debates today at the Synod of Bishops. In a speech from the floor this morning, Maximos V. Hakim, the Melchite Patriarch of Antioch, defended the ordination of married as well as celibate men to the priesthood as being fully in accord with the earliest traditions of the church. He said that discussion of celibacy among Western church leaders had left a “very painful impression” elsewhere. He said that Western policy regarding marriage for priests was intransigent and had cost the Eastern rite “tens of thousands of followers.” Earlier, Maxim Hermaniuk, the Ukrainian Metropolitan of Winnipeg, had urged that the question of ordaining married men be left up to the Eastern churches and, in the case of those following the Latin rite, Ito national episcopal conferlences. Like Eastern Orthodox churches, Eastern rite Catholics permit priests to marry before ordination. Bishops, however, are chosen from the ranks of the celibate clergy. Eastern rite leaders have charged frequently that Vatican proclamations on the celibacy issue do not take sufficient account of the fact that one section of the church permits priests to marry. They have also expressed resentment that in some countries, including the United States, the Vatican has forced them to conform to Western practices regarding celibacy. The Eastern rite leaders made their remarks as the Synod, which opened a month‐long meeting here Thursday, took up the question of the crisis in the priesthood. One proposal that it will debate is a change in church discipline to permit the ordination of already married men. The synod was established at the end of the Second Ecu menical Council, which met from 1962 to 1965, as a forum to provide Pope Paul with advice on major church issues. More than 200 bishops, heads of male religious orders and Eastern rite patriarchs arc participating. Thus far, discussions have focused on the theological basis of the priesthood. Early next week, the delegates will take up specific practical problems, such as celibacy and the rights of priests to become involved in politics as a means of effective social change. The basic theological problem stems from the Council, which greatly broadened the church's concept of ministry. In doing so, the Council fathers paid much more attention to the ministry of bishops and laymen than they did to that of priests. In the six years since the Council, serious problems have arisen for the church over such matters as the rights of priests in relation to bishops, or how a priest is different from a layman. “A lot of priests need to be reassured on what their role is and just what it is that makes them indispensable,” said the Most Rev. William Baum, Bishop of Springfield, Mo,, one, of the delegates appointed by Pope Paul. Some Latin rite bishops defended mandatory celibacy today. The Archbishop of Madhurai, India, Justin Diravian, said that Asian priests were widely respected for their celibacy. He said that relaxation of the rule would cause “immense damage” to the church in India.

87-> The Last Refuge
The House Banking Committee has approved a bill that would authorize $2 billion in Government loan guarantees for companies in trouble, especially for the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, which says it must have $250 million immediately to save it from bankruptcy. Before the House committee had acted, Deputy De fense Secretary David Packard submitted prepared testi mony saying that he was firmly opposed to expanding legislation for Lockheed into a general bill for bailing out other businesses. Mr. Packard said the Defense. Depart ment “does not need nor want a broad loan guarantee bill which will only encourage continuation of these practices which have caused this trouble.” On orders from the Administration, however, Mr. Packard sought to withdraw that part of his testimony opposing a broad bill, but Representative Wright Patman insisted on put ting Mr. Packard's original remarks into the record. The broad loan guarantee legislation, now adopted by both Senate and House banking committees, would cer tainly intensify the Pentagon's already serious problem of holding private businesses up to adequate standards of performance on defense contracts. But the dangers would go beyond that. For this legislation would do much to remove the risks for other large corporations that might get into trouble as a, result of management inefficiency or blunders. Presumably if this legislation is enacted, any large corporation about to fail would be able to get help by pleading that thousands and thousands of workers would lose their jobs. Although Lockheed has based its case in part upon the preservation of competition in the aircraft manufacturing industry, this bill is essentially anticompetitive in its implications. For it would mean that a precedent and a mechanism had been established for bailing out very large and very inefficient companies. One is forced to wonder what other candidates for loan guarantees the Administration or the Congressional committees have in mind after Lockheed gets its $250 million. Will they be airlines? Will they be steel com panies? Would a loan have gone to Penn Central, that poorly managed railroad had not gone bankrupt? The birth and death of companies is essential to healthy, dynamic and efficient economic system, not a process of Government bailouts to keep failing man agements alive. The approaching end of the Vietnam war should mean a further reduction in the nation's output of helicopters, air transports and many other defense goods. If, in the name of general employment policy, unneeded defense producers are kept in business and well‐supplied with orders, there will be vast wast age of resources and a diversion of national energies of the kind that President Eisenhower foresaw in warn ing of the impact on national policy of the military industrial complex. Proponents of the loan to Lockheed insist that the L‐1011 Tristar airbus is a good airplane with excellent prospects for capturing a large share of the commercial market. If this is so, why do the commercial banks that have been working closely with Lockheed not lend it the additional money? Why should Government bear the risk? Or, if Lockheed is not soundly managed and the prospects for the L‐1011 are dubious, why should its management team be rescued? Where is the evidence that the national economy stands in peril if this rescue operation is not rushed through? Are there not more serious risks to the effec tiveness of the American economy if a precedent established for rescuing huge and inefficient corpora tions and substituting Government decision‐making for private commercial lending decisions? Before this loan guarantee legislation is passed, the House and Senate will do well to demand better answers to such questions in free and unencumbered debate.

89-> Learning to Love the Police
LONDON—We need the police today, more than ever before because our moral values are being eroded by change and the conflicts between economic, generational and racial groups have come to the surface. Men not only fail to regulate themselves and each other; they are often angry and violent. This leaves public order to the police. It is their primary task and only they have the powers to maintain it. Unfortunately, police action is more likely to aggravate than to solve this problem. Because they and we have long felt that their primary job is law enforcement—that is, forcing people to obey laws they don't like—the police have become a kind of army of occupation. This military posture and image is growing stronger. We see the police, helmeted and carrying shields, advancing in military formation against crowds of protesting citizens. Some of them have been seriously injured by these angry crowds and they anxiously seek to protect themselves. Yet this understandable defense drives them further from their fellow citizens. No one, particularly the police, is happy about this. The police were long ago driven by such events to build a wall of secrecy around their affairs and to see the public as their enemy. Twenty years ago, when I studied the police, they had developed moral codes emphasizing secrecy and encouraging the illegitimate use of violence to maintain respect for themselves and to solve etimes. The police felt that they needed these rules to survive and do their work in a hostile society. Under the impact of current urban violence, these codes are stronger than ever, I have no doubt. Such group‐defensive codes persist because police work constantly brings the policeman into conflict with the community. It will continue to do so as long as the primary function of the police is thought to be law enforcement, with its consequences of military organization and a psychology of force. It is particularly disturbing to find that all urban police departments in the United States use this organizational model, since their primary function is not law enforcement. The main job has always been the maintenance of order, and here I include such dayto‐day activities as the control of traffic, the settling of domestic disputes, the direction of crowds, the untangling and ordering of human affairs as they arise on the streets of our cities. The, difference in perspective resulting from a primary emphasis on the maintenance of order as contrasted with emphasis on law enforcement is very important. If you emphasize law enforcement (as the police have done because it is the task area wherein they receive the most complaints and kudos and the most political pressure) then you tend to organize, think and act like an army. You tend to be represrave and rigid. If, on the other hand, you put the maintenance of order first, you must, in a democratic society, cooperate with the people involved and use a therapeutic, constructive, and flexible approach to the community. The principal objectives of modern urban policing should be the maintenance of public order. To achieve this objective, the police must have the cooperation of citizens, be trained in skills eliciting such cooperation and be given a relationship to the Community which breeds trust and confidence. To this end it would help if (a) police departments themselves were democratized and decentralized, (b) the decentralized units were community based, so that the order which prevails reflects the needs of our different communities, and (c) the line between the police department and the community were removed by involving citizens from the local community in the direct management of the local police, and policemen in the direct management of the community. The police must be given the advantage of sophisticated knowledge of social organizations which is now transforming industry and other community institutions in ways appropriate to the requirements of modern

90-> Harry Rogoff,
Harry Rogoff, editor in chief of The Jewish Daily Forward from 1951 to 1964 and one of its active columnists until his illness this month, died yester day at his home, 258 Riverside Drive. He was 88 years old. Mr. Rogoff joined The For ward, the leading Yiddish‐lan guage daily in this country, un der the editorship of its found er, Abraham Cahan, in 1907, as city editor. Ho soon became managing editor and was act ing editor for several years be fore his appointment to the top editorial post after the death of Mr. Cahan. Mr. Rogoff's tenure spanned the years after the paper's founding by a group of Social Democratic labor leaders to spur immigrants to join unions, through the 1920's, when it at tained a daily circulation of, 225,000, and to its current de cline, as it reflects the dwin dling interest in and knowledge of the Yiddish language among the children and grandchildren of the Jewish immigrants. A Native of Russia Born in Berezino, Russia, a son of Isaac Rogoff and the former Sarah Yachnowitz, Mr. Rogoff came to this country in 1892 and was graduated from City College in ??. At the convention of the Jewish Socialist Federation in Forward Hall at 175 Broadway just 42 years ago today, Mr. Rogoff found the prospects for forming a labor party in the United States unfavorable be cause, he said, “American labor unions are too conservative.” He noted that labor, leaders felt they could get labor legis lation from the old political parties and “in spite” of dis appointments they refuse to give up.” For most of his career, Mr. Rogoff worked under the ven erable Mr. Cahan, who largely determined The Forward's edi torial policies and style. Mr. Rogoff, after stepping down as editor, was one of the early “doves” on Vietnam, urging in 1967 an end to the bombing of North Vietnam. At the time, the paper's editorial policy was generally in support of President Johnson's foreign policies. Associates said yester day that this was in keeping with the paper's long tradition of letting its columnists speak their own mind on controver sial matters. Mr. Rogoff sup ported the election of Senator Charles E. Goodell in 1970 when the paper backed Repre sentative Richard L. Ottinger. Mr. Rogoff's published works in Yiddish include “Nine Yid dish Writers” (1915), “How America Is Governed” (1918), “East Side Epic” (1931); a five‐ volume “History of the United States” (1932) and, in 1954, “Der Geist fun Forverts” (The Spirit of The Forward), a col lection of essays and sketches of the writers who had given the newspaper its character. Surviving are his widow, the former Anna Kavaler; a son, Julian; a daughter, Mrs. Phoebe Kave; a brother, Abraham M.; three grandchildren and one great‐grandchild. The funeral service will be tomorrow at 10 A.M. at the Park West, Columbus Avenue and 79th Street.

91-> Pakistan to Ask a Moratorium on Debts
KARACHI, May 1—With financial resources sorely strained by the political condi tion in the Eastern part of the country, Pakistan announced today that she would ask creditor nations for a six‐month moratorium on payments of her external debt. The official Government news agency reported that Pakistan had asked that a special meet ing of the Aid to Pakistan Consortium be convened next month, at which Pakistan's re quest for the moratorium would be presented. Pakistan's debt of about $4‐ billion is owed to consortium members including the United States, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Develop ment, Japan, Canada and West European nations. The single greatest share is borne by the United States. The Government announced that a representative of the World Bank had arrived in Rawalpindi, capital of West Pakistan, to discuss the matter with Pakistani authoritias. Earlier today, the Govern ment announced major new re strictions on imports to Pakis tan as a means of halting the sharp decline of foreign reserves here since fighting broke out last March 25. West Pakistan has incurred large expenses in suppressing separatist rebels in East Pakis tin during the last month. The economy har been further dam aged by a decline in production of jute and other export prod ucts in East Pakistan, which are mainstays of the national econ omy. Making matters worse, inland transportation and port activity in East Pakistan have suffered the effects of the fighting, and distribution of goods has been reported a serious problem in some areas. Nevertheless, the Government said today that transportation in East Pakistan was rapidly (returning to normal, and that the rebels had been largely sup pressed. Inland river traffic was said to have resumed today from the Dacca area at the, center of East Pakistan to Chittagong, major port on the Bay of Ben gal. The Government denied that fighting continued and said that allegedly infiltrating Indian Border Security Force troops and local “miscreant” followers had been defeated. According to Government re ports here, armed separatist resistance in East Pakistan has been almost wiped out. The Government says that all im portant towns in East Pakistan are secured and that life is re turning to normal. The Karachi radio reported today another apparent break in the ranks of the outlawed Awami League—the political arm of Bengali separatists who advocate secession of East 1Pakistan from the nation. Ac cording te the announcement, A. B. Zaman, a National As semblyman who was elected to the Parliament as an Awami League member, has repudi ated the party's separatist posi tion and, called for national unity. He is the second Awami League member to have de fected to the Government's cause in the last few days. On March 26, President Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan banned: the Awami League, which held a majority of the seats in the national assembly, and prohibited all political ac tivity. Legal experts are dis cussing the future of Assem blymen belonging to the de funct league. The Awami League has no National Assembly members elected from West Pakistan. The split is wholly between the politically dominant West and the more populous East, which are separated by nearly 1,000 miles of Indian territory.

93-> Woman,65, Mugged In Baruch Houses On Lower East Side
A woman resident of the Baruch Houses, where the death of another woman in a robbery attempt last week led to stepped‐up police patrols, was mugged in a hallway of the Lower East Side housing project yesterday. The police of the Clinton Street station said that the mugging took place just before 9 A.M., as Mrs. Rosario Melendez, 65 years old, was on her way from her fourth‐floor apartment at 95 Baruch Drive to the third‐floor apartment of her daughter‐in‐law, Mrs. Carmen Golden, in the same building. As she entered the thirdfloor hallway from the stairway, she was pushed into an elevator by her attackers, who placed a cotton bandage saturated with an unidentified liquid over her nose and wound white cord around her neck. Mrs. Melendez's daughter‐inlaw heard her screams, ran into the hallway and raced up to the sixth floor, where the indicator showed the elevator to be. There she found Mrs. Melendez dazed, lying on the floor of the elevator. Mrs. Melendez's screams apparently frightened away her attackers. Mrs. Melendez had left her handbag in her apartment and the police said that nothing was taken from her. She was taken to Beth Israel Hospital, where she was released after treatment. Because of what Chief Daniel J. Daly of the Housing Authority police called a “similarity in the modus operandi,” the police were checking into a possible link between yesterday's mugging and the murder last Monday of Mrs. Diana Appelbaum of 140 Columbia Street in the Baruch project.

96-> Mr. Agnew and the World
Vice President Agnew no longer can qualify as an innocent abroad. Given the office he holds, his third foreign trip is bound to affect the interests of this country in the world. Why was it that his itinerary took him almost exclusively to countries under authori tarian rule, rather than to some of the democracies along the route? Was it really advisable for Mr. Agnew to participate in Francisco Franco's celebration of the 35th anniversary of the revolt that, with the aid of Hitler and Mussolini, crushed the Spanish Republic? Why did he feel com pelled en route to draw odious contrasts between authoritarian rulers of three African states (“dedicated, enlightened, dynamic”) and “most” American Negro leaders, whom he accused of “querulous complaints and constant recriminations against the rest of society?” Mr. Agnew is certainly not a fascist and he doubtles's comprehends the debits that accrue for the United States if its Vice President helps Generalissimo Franco, a relic of the fascist floodtide, observe a day that still stings the consciences of every democratic country Europe. The Vice President must know why it is that Emperor Haile Selassie and President Mobutu do not have to worry much about “querulous complaints” from their political opponents in Ethiopia and In the Congo. If, as Mr. Agnew says, every leader he has met on his ten‐nation trip is “appalled” by publication of the Pentagon papers in American newspapers, he surely knows that this owes something to the fact that most of these leaders do not tolerate a free press—and some allow no freedom of any kind. The impact of this trip on Mr. Agnew's political fortunes at home is a matter between himself and President Nixon; how it affects the standing of the United States is a matter of concern for us all.

The triple, which will be feature of the eighth race each night as it was at this year's first homestand, requires the bettor to select in order the first three finishers. The exacta, in which the 1‐2 finish must be picked, will be part of betting on the third, fifth, seventh and ninth races. Topping the first card of the meeting, which continues through Oct. 14, will be an open handicap one‐mile trot for a gross purse of $20,000. The presence of Duncan MacDon ald's Fresh Yankee, the 8‐year‐old mare assigned the No. post, will add interest to the race, in which she is listed at even money, but is likely to be sent away as the odds‐on favorite. Fresh Yankee has earned $957,548. Among trotters, only France's Une de Mai, with $1,116,000, has banked more. In her last 56 outings, Fresh Yankee has not finished worse than third. Joe O'Brien, who usually drives Fresh Yankee, is driving at Brandywine Raceway, out side Wilmington, Del., so George Phalen will substitute for him. Phalen handles most of O'Brien's charges in his absence.

SEOUL, South Korea, May 1 —President Chung Hee Park, who won a third four‐year term in Tuesday's national election, said in a victory statement to day that he would pursue a “positive and pragmatic diplom acy” in the future. In his first public comment on the outcome of the election, which gave him a large margin of 946,928 votes over his chief rival, the former general reaf firmed his campaign pledge to wipe out corruption in the next four years. He also set May 25 for National Assembly elections. “I will devote all my efforts to the realization of national harmony and the build‐up of our democratic strength to overwhelm Communist North Korea,” Mr. Park stated. “Externally,” he added. “I wil carryout a positive and prag matic diplomacy on the basis of accurate judgment and assessment of the rapidly changing international situa tion in order to firmly safe guard peace and freedom of the nation.” Although he did not elaborate on this point, it was generally felt here that Mr. Park, who first came to power in a mili tary cpup d'état 10 years ago, would gradually‐soften his rigid policy toward Communist coun tries. In the May 25 voting, a total of 204 are to be elected to the unicameral legislature. Mem bers of Mr. Park's Democratic Republican party now hold two‐ thirds of the Assembly seats.

Airline officials said that the plane carried 55 passengers and a crew of 8— [37 Britons, 8 Ausltrians and four Japanese in addition to the Americans. The airline said the names of the victims would not be made public until next of kin had been notified. Thu 10‐year‐old Vanguard, en route from London to Salzburg, Austria, went out of control after one of its four turboprop engines exploded, according to a farmer, Walter Maertens, who saw the crash.. “It sloped down, managed to avoid a row of trees, shot up in the air pretty steeply, and then crashed,” Mr. Maertens said. “The cause of the crash is tonight a complete and utter mystery,” an airline spokesman said. The crash occurred on the land of George Bollaert. Mrs. Bollaert said: “We saw what looked like a ball of fire corning down over our fields.” A police spokesman said reports from witnesses indicated that the pilot, Capt. E. T. Probert, had tried for an emergency landing. The plane, smoke pouring from one wing, touched down in one field, jumped a road, and plowed through grassland for 500 yards. It gouged into the ground and burst into flames in a pit 15 feet deep. Dr. Jozef van Overschelde of the local fire brigade, who arrived a few minutes later, said he found bodies and wreckage over hundreds of yards. The main, part of the wreckage was burning when I arrived,” he said. “Those aboard have been crushed and burned. There could be no surviviors.” Mrs. Bollaert said that “the fire spread from the wreckage like waves.” The airline sent an investigation team from London to inspect the site and join the police in searching for the flight recorder and seeking the cause of the crash. Policemen said that they expected great difficulty in identifying the bodies, which were taken to a village of Aarsele. The Vanguard was carrying four pilots—two more than usual—in what B.E.A. called a route‐checking flight. An airline spokesman said he did not know yet why a Vanguard was used on the flight, usually made by a Viscount. Vanguards usally are used within the British Isles. News of the crash created “terrible scenes” among relatives waiting at Salzburg Airport, a spokesman there said. “Some of them needed medical attention,” he added. A B.E.A. spokesman dismissed suggestions that the Vanguard, which had been used on the London‐Belfast route, might have been sabotaged by Northern Ireland extremists. He said the plane had not been on Belfast service for at least 48 hours and was in Edinburg all day Friday. The last B. E. A. crash was in 1967, when a flight from Athens to Nicosia crashed in the Mediterranean, killing 66. An investigation determined that the plane, a Comet, had been sabotaged.

101-> Karl Marx and the Irish
OSLO—The interesting thing about current urban guerrilla violence in North Ireland is that Communist move ments abroad seem to have abided by international rules of behavior and have done little to pour oil on the fire. FOREIGN AFFAIRS Although some arms emanating from Czechoslovakia have been seized on the way to Ulster, top London authorities say that foreign Commu nist states and movements appear so far to have kept out of the mess. The reason this is so interesting is that Marxism has been concerned with Ireland even longer than it has been concerned with Russia. Contemporary Marxist doctrine teaches that Ireland was the first country to develop a “national liberation movement.” Both Marx and Engels studied the Irish question more than a century ago and Engels actually began a history of Ireland that he never finished. On Nov. 2, 1867, Marx wrote Engels: “I used to think the separation of Ireland from England impossible. I now think it inevitable.” Marx also wrote: “The English working class will never accomplish anything until it has got rid of Ireland. . . . English reaction in England had its roots . . . in the sub jugation of Ireland.” Communism in the two Irelands is small and divided into rival groups. However, all appear to agree on press ing violence and seeking to apply enough force so that Britain ultimately agrees to let both Irelands unite, de spite the vigorous objections of Ulster's Protestant majority. This concept is most urgently put forth by the Guevarists, not only in order to achieve settlement of the Irish problem but also to embarrass Britain and enfeeble the West. The current issue of a Havana magazine called “Tricontinental” proclaims: “A blow delivered against British imperialist bourgeois rule by a rebel lion in Ireland has a hundred times greater political significance than blow . . . in Asia dr in Africa. . . . Ireland, unique today in Europe, re mains in the struggle for its national liberation.” The Marxist thesis is that the British Empire began with the invasion of Ireland in 1169 and that in the seven teenth century Britain forced the in digenous population of Ulster to emi grate and gave their land to Scottish immigrants—ancestral core of today's North Irish Protestant majority. The Marxist thesis stresses economic exploitation. It argues that Ulster's Catholic population was decimated by lack of jobs; that London won't will ingly relinquish control over Ulster because that would force it to pay for imports which now come duty‐free from the North. Irish Communists apparently are trying to use their very small numer ical influence to burrow into the Irish Republican Army which itself is di vided. The Guevarists claim the I.R.A. “feels deep solidarity with the Cuban and Vietnamese revolutions” as well as Al Fatah, the Arab guerrilla group, but such claims clearly could only apply to the I.R.A. “provisionals” who are leading the current Ulster cam paign. The Communists have no mass movement in either Ireland because both the Catholic South and the large ly Protestant North maintain deeply religious prejudices against Marxism, even if some groups borrow from its strategies. Aware of this, the Com munists stress unity of both faiths in violence. The Guevarists say: “The idea of revolution is ingrained in the Irish mind. . . . The closest allies of the Republican movement, and the only left force with ties to the Protestant working class [in Ulster], is the Communist party. . . . The North ern Irish are Irish, not British, and Republicanism is the one political force that can possibly unite Catholic and Protestant.” The Guevarists urge violent revolu tion to establish in a united Ireland “an Irish workers' and small farmers' republic.” They contend that “Ireland has the only revolutionary movement in Europe with a military component and a strategy of armed struggle.” And they conclude with this grim warning: “Full‐scale guerrilla war can not be excluded as a future possi bility.” This rationale gives special urgency to the need for tranquilizing the pres ent crisis and then attempting to work out a new political deal that will in sure fair treatment and equal rights for all Irishmen. Only such an ap proach can avoid the ultimate possi bility that Europe's terrible religious conflict, the Thirty Years War, will not again flare up in the one corner where its embers still glow—this time with a contemporaneous Marxist tinge.

102-> COACH IS ENJOYING RECRUITLESS FIVE
Jack Kaminer is on the other side of the hectic college basketball recruiting scene and enjoying it more. In the five years Kaminer coached at talent‐laden Win gate High School in Brooklyn before taking over as City Col lege coach for the final seven games last season, he was heavily involved in recruiting. He had dealings with college coaches and recruiters from all parts of the country in trying to place his players. The City College policy does not permit recruiting. “I'm happy not to be in volved in recruiting any more,” said the 29‐year‐old Kaminer, whose team upset Columbia, 50‐49, in its opener and beat Adelphi, 87‐62. “I have seen both sides of the coaching and recruiting pressures and like it better this way.” In his last season at Wingate (1969‐70), the Generals won all 20 of their games and the Public Schools Athletic League championship. The Wingate players were heavily recruited; Bernie Hardin and Phil Larkins are at Ellsworth (Iowa) Junior College, which won the national championship last season, and Darius Seguri is at Brevard Junior College in Florida. Frank Heyward, the captain of that Wingate team, went to Miami and then to Fordham after Miami had dropped bas ketball. City College does not have any former high school stand outs, nor does Kaminer expect he will get any. Most of the members of his 15‐man squad never played high school ball. For some the extent of their experience has been church league and playground compe tition. Kaminer believes that the open‐enrollment policy, by which every New York City high school graduate must be admitted to the City University system if he seeks to further his education, will help the city colleges. “We'll get some good tal ent,” he said, “but never the real standouts. They will al ways be up for grabs by the major local and out ‐ of ‐ town schools. “Sometimes I think I prefer coaching players without that big high school reputation. Players like that are apt to be willing to learn and listen more.”

103-> Apostolic Succession Doubted By Study for Catholic Bishops
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Oct. 2 (AP)—The National Catholic Reporter says a $500,000 study on priestly life and ministry questions the doctrine of apostolic succession—the belief that Catholic bishops enjoy a divine authority handed down by the original apostles. Excerpts from the study, sponsored by Roman Catholic bishops in the United States, are carried in a copyright article in the Oct. 8 issue of National Catholic Reporter, an independent weekly published in Kansas City. The study has not been released. The newspaper reports the study also questions the permanence of ordination to the priesthood. The report was prepared under direction of the Rev. Carl Armbruster, who drew fire from delegates to a meeting of United States bishops last April in Detroit when he suggested there are no theological reasons prohibiting married men from being priests or the ordination of women. The report said that “two major theological issues present themselves as especially urgent in regard to the Christian ministry and priesthood— church authority and the permanency of ordination.” It questioned the notion “that 12 apostles appointed immediate successors, from whom in turn further successors were commissioned in an unbroken historical chain” to the present. “Theological reflection suggests that in a sense it is the entire church which succeeds the apostolic college,” the report said. The report also questions the concept of “the indelible character” imprinted at the time of sacramental ordination. Father Armbruster said the report by his subcommittee on the systematic theology of the priesthood, was completed Sept. 15 and was sent to the bishops' committee on priestly life and ministry, chaired by John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia. An aide to the Most Rev. Joseph Bernardin, secretary of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, told the National Catholic Reporter that no decision has been made on a release date for the document. Father Armbruster is on the faculty of Weston College in Weston, Mass.

104-> Health Department to Monitor Cost Rise for Hospital Services
The city's Health Department has developed plans to monitor hospital services to slow down a cost rise that has skyrocketed from $30 a day here in 1955 to $110 in 1968 and about $140 to $150 now. The department plans, made known last week, would send audit teams into hospitals to study seven functional areas representing 61.6 per cent of operating costs and 81.5 per cent of manpower, as of 1969, with “critical” influence on patient care and stay. First Deputy Commissioner Lowell E. Bellin said these areas had been chosen during a six‐month feasibility study of four cooperating hospitals — one municipal, one voluntary‐teaching, one voluntary nonteaching and one proprietary—that provided Medicaid service to large numbers of patients. The department hopes to try out the plan in 12 to 14 hospitals for two and a half years. The initial study had a $200,000 Federal grant from the Medical Service Administration administering Medicaid, and the department is now seeking $900,000 from the Social Security Administration which operates the Medicare program for the elderly to be coupled with $100,000 in city services and staffing. The field audits will delve into the following areas where the cost percentage breakdown is as follows: Admitting and administrative offices, 13.7; operating rooms, 4.0; radiology, 4.2; laboratory services, 5.5; nursing 24.4; utilization review, 4.0, and dietary services, 9.8. Other areas account for the remainder. The feasibility study reported three of the four hospitals lacked “optimal administrative control of beds,” with clinical services controlling all beds in the municipal hospital. No routine preadmission testing or medical review existed in any of the four. Radiology costs and productivity ranged from an average 1.39 man‐hours for each procedure in the proprietary hospital to 2.45 man‐hours in the voluntary teaching hospital, wtith respective unit costs of $8.04 and $19.61 for each procedure. Messenger services added to delays. Laboratory scheduling, the study found, could cause an extra stay of one to three days in the voluntary nonteaching hospital because certain series were scheduled only once or twice a week. The voluntary teaching hospitals' lack of licensed practical nurses suggested “an unnaturally high ratio of registered nurses and subsequent high cost of nursing care,” the study reported. The proprietary hospital “had the most aggressive utilization review committee.” In dietary services, a patient's meal cost averaged $1.82 in the nonteaching hospital and $2.60 in the voluntary teaching hospital, but the latter had a higher productivity‐4.05 meals for each man‐hour to 3.03. Inpatient hospital and nursing home care accounts for 70 per cent of the $650‐million annual Medicaid bill for care of the sick poor here. Health Department audits of quality and abuses in other professional services in Medicaid have gone on since 1966. Dr. Bellin estimated the audits had saved or recovered $41 for each dollar spent in review in 1968. Since then, he said, Medicaid benefits have been cut back, and providers have become “more careful.” Even so, he estimates $2.50 to $3 is saved currently for each dollar out of approximately $3.5‐million spent for 300 staff members. In the past, Dr. Bellin said, hospitals had “little incentive to improve efficiency,” as reimbursement plans meant they would in effect be “penalized fiscally for having empty beds.” He said he believed hospitals now recognized that costs were getting “out of hand,” and were ready to cooperate with government efforts for efficiency.

105-> Bouzy Rouge to Come to U.S.; Red Wine From Champagne
BOUZY, France — There is no such thing as a red champagne, but the champagne country does produce a few red wines, of which the only one at all well‐known is Bouzy rouge. With a name like that, it would seem a a natural for the transAtlantic market, but Bouzy is a notoriously poor traveler; even at home, it is unstable, and only a few Paris restauants handle it. “My father told me, ‘Never make a Bouzy rouge —it's a wine that's always acting up’,” said Mayor George Vesselle. But the mayor, a shrewd and wellto‐do farmer who is occasionally mistaken for President Pompidou, will turn a considerable part of his crop this year into red wine. He says a filtration process has much improved the stability, and he will even ship some to the United States, where some amateurs think it worth the price, a bit higher than champagne. Nearly all the grapes in Bouzy are black—pinot noir. The juice, however, is white if after pressing it is quickly separated from the skins, as most of it is for champagne. Because Bouzy is one of the grands crus of champagne, the grapes command a top price. For red wine, the juice is left with the skins for a period. With the harvest now ending, it may as well be said that the news for the consumer is not stimulating. As elsewhere in France, the month of June was a disaster, cutting the crop to about half of normal. Except for a few local hailstorms, August and September were dry and sunny, much improving the quality. Fortunately, last year's champagne crop set a record for quantity, at least 60 per cent larger than normal. Contrary to the hoopla but true to the rule that a big crop is seldom a fine one, 1970 was only a “quite good average year,” according to Jean Couvreur, general manager of Mumm in Rheims. The price will of course go up, from 10 to 15 per cent in France and about 5 per cent abroad. The difference, Mr. Couvreur said, is due to competition of other sparkling wines in the world market. In Bouzy, Mr. Vesselle explained over a lunch of leg of lamb, flageolets and Bouzy rouge that champagne eligible for the name could come from grapes grown only on certain limestone hillsides, delimited by law as well as nature. That portion of eligible land not already planted in vines is hardly plantable, he said. In the courtyard, workmen were unloading grapes for the pressing. They were small, but unusually sweet. “I think it will make a very fine vintage, like 1961,” the Mayor said. “Of course, we only got three and one‐half or four tons to the hectare—10 Tears ago, I'd have said so many ‘caques to the verge’, but the old measures are vanishing from the language.” The wicker baskets, woven by gypsies, are vanishing; plastic tubs are taking their place. Otherwise, the harvest scene was much as ever: miners and their families from the north visibly enjoytheir vacation in the fields, the occasional pop of firecrackers used to chase birds from the grapes. In one field, outside the zone of the high‐priced crop, there was even a family making its own table wine, with two giggling girls with bare red legs stamping the grapes.

106-> The Nation
The stock market is surging again. Last week's trading vol ume on the New York Stock Ex change broke all previous rec ords. Since mid‐November, stock prices have moved up strongly and by Friday's closing had climbed a third of the way out of the depths of 1970's bear mar ket. Wall Street's professional mon ey managers think they know why. A year ago, when it was be coming clear that President Nixon would not shrink from his policy of economic restraint to curb inflation, the worst bear market since the Depression ma terialized. Now, they say, a new kind of market has taken shape largely because the President's economic policy has changed. A stimulative Federal budget deficit is forecast for, fiscal 1971 and 1972, and the money supply once more is expanding. And just as last year's market reacted to economic restraint, this year's market is responding to economic stimulation, both present and an ticipated. How do market watchers know? They read it all in the ticker tape. The stock market doesn't have a consciousness of its own, of course, and so its behavior must reflect human de cisions. The professionals who manage the investment portfolios for large institutions—mutual funds, say, or insurance compa nies—account for more than half of the trading volume of the New York Stock Exchange; and they have decided to buy. Two recent market character istics have made this obvious, First, the big upsurge in trading has occurred almost exclusively on the New. York exchange, which is the market for higher priced blue chips of the type sought by institutional portfolio managers. Second, the size of the trans actions has risen sharply—to a dimension far beyond the reach of small investors. The average trade on the New York Stock Exchange in the last few weeks has been well over 400 shares, or an estimated $20,000 in value. In 1968, when the public was heavily Invested, the average trade was only 300 shares. Last Tuesday, for example, when a record 28,25 million shares changed hands, the aver age transaction was just under 500 shares. And a big portion of the total came in only two blocks, both involving 2 million shares of Greyhound—obviously institu tional trades. Meanwhile, trading volume on the American Stock Exchange has not even come close to rec ord levels and the over‐the‐coun ter Market has remained virtually dormant. Professional money men rarely dabble in these arenas, because they tend to be the homes of more speculative is sues. The money managers are going to the Big Board, using their ac cumulations of cash to buy stock on the theory that a rising econ omy will mean rising corporate earnings that, in turn, will justify higher stock prices. Nobody can predict what this means for small investors be cause nobody can say how much institutional money will flow into the market or how long the flow will continue. But there are plenty of historical precedents. A surge in purchase of blue chip stocks is often the first phase of a stock market recovery. Interest is thus centered on the Big Board. Then comes buying on the more, speculative Ameri can exchange and ultimately, re newed interest in over‐the‐coun ter stocks and new issues. It almost always happens this way. But, of course, it doesn't have to this time.

107-> William Owen Cowgfer, 49, Dies; Former Kentucky Representative
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 2 (AP)—Former Kentucky Representative William Owen Cowger died here tonight in Kentucky Baptist Hospital at the age of 49. Hospital physicians said he suffered an apparent heart attack. Mr. Cowger, a liberal Republican with strong urban and civil rights orientations, was defeated for election to a third term in 1970 by a liberal Democrat, State Senator Romano T. Mazzoli. The election was close and was eventually settled on the basis of absentee ballots. But its most curious facet was that Mr. Cowger, who organized a liberal coalition to sweep oldline Democrats out of power when he ran for Mayor of this Democratic city in 1961, felt forced to call in Vice President Agnew to help round up conservative votes. As Mayor from 1961 to 1965, he pushed through stiff antidiscrimination laws, opening the city's public facilities to Negroes and moving against job discrimination. He was well regarded by labor and by urban voters. But, in 1970, he was challenged by a younger, more liberal Democrat who courted young voters and spoke out against the war in Vietnam. In the House during his two terms, Mr. Cowger consistently voted for housing, education and urban assistance. On four occasions when President Nixon vetoed spending bills, he joined others in voting to override the President. In 1967, Mr. Cowger was elected president of the “90th Club,” composed of freshmen Representatives over the opposition of conservative members of the House. As Mayor, Mr. Cowger was among the first Southerners openly to court the black vote, declaring in 1966 that “you cannot ignore any sector of your electorate.” Mr. Cowger was horn in Hastings, Neb., on Jan. 1, 1922. He obtained a bachelor's degree from Carleton College in 1943 and did graduate work at the University of Louisville and American University in Washington. He was president of Thompson and Cowger Company, Inc., a mortgage and realty firm in Louisville. In 1969 Mr. Cowger and his wife, the former Cynthia Thompson, were devorced. He is survived by two children, David and Cynthia.

108-> Moscow's Dilemma
Despite the oft‐proved capabilities of the Soviet Intel ligence services, the Kremlin evidently was as surprised as everybody else when the Nixon trip to China was announced. The surprise was implicit in the reserved manner with which the Soviet press presented the news. That there was no Moscow “line” on the subject became clear earlier in the week when sharply different reactions appeared in Warsaw and Sofia. The Poles welcomed the news while the Bulgarians raised the specter of a Sino American alliance against the Soviet Union. Now hints of a negative Soviet attitude have begun emerge publicly. Literaturnaya Gazeta has reprinted the Bulgarian blast, while ignoring the quite different Polish reaction. Yesterday the semi‐official organ of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Novoye Vremya, published a general attack on Peking's foreign policy which, while failing to mention the Nixon visit, declared, “As soon as they see a chance for an accommodation with imperialism that could be profitable to the national interest of China, the Chinese leaders do an about‐face. They forget their duty to the national liberation movement.” One need not be clairvoyant to know what the magazine is talking about. Nevertheless, the continued cautious Moscow reaction points to a dilemma in the Kremlin, The Soviet Union now is trying to improve its relations with both Wash ington and Peking. For the Soviet regime to declare pub licly that it is somehow perfidious or Immoral for Wash ington and Peking to try to improve their own ties would be too obviously inconsistent. Moscow would dearly like to have a world in which it had good relations with both the United States and China while the latter wasted their resources in mutual suspicion and preparation for pos sible hostilities. It is not an easy quandary to solve, especially since harsh Soviet criticism of Chinese American reconciliation could help drive Washington and Peking together while tending to worsen the strained relations of both countries with Moscow.

109-> CLINIC HERE PLANS ABORTIONS FOR $80
A clinic able to perform more than 10,000 abortions a year for an average fee of $80 will be opened here this summer by Planned Parenthood of New York City. The center is also being de signed to serve 10,000 to 12,000 people a year seeking help with contraception. It will oc cupy the entire fouith floor at 380 Second Avenue, at 22d Street. The clinic, if the organiza tion's hopes are realized, will handle a significant number of the abortions done here. The total number performed in the city since legalization last July 1 has just passed the 100,000 mark. About half the women were New Yorkers and half were from out of the state. The clinic's back‐up hospi tal, which is required by the city Health Code, will be the Berth Israel Medical Center. The code requires that in case of emergency an abortion patient can be taken to a hospi tal in less than 10 minutes. Alfred F. Moran, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood, predicts that the average $80 fee, plus Medicaid reimbursements for indigent pa tients, will make the clink self sustaining. Funds to set up the center are being obtained from a vari ety of sources. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund has pledged $200,000; the Scaife Family Trust of Pittsburgh donated $60,000; another foundation anonymously donated $60,000. And additional money is being sought. The new center, Mr. Moran said, “will be a prototype for the development of additional centers throughout the city, state and nation and will stimu late the conversion of so‐called abortion clinics” into facilities that would also provide compre hensive birth‐control services. Mr. Moran said that the clinic would try to serve any woman who sought its services, but that priority would be given to low‐income residents of the city. Initially, at least, abortions will be performed only on women pregnant less than 10 lweeks, using either the suction procedure or dilation andcuret tage. In any case, most obstetri cians clans refuse to use these procedures after the 12th week. The standard abortion pro cedure in later stages of pregnancy is the “salting‐out” technique, in which abortion is induced by injecting saline solu tion into the uterus. Dr. Ray E. Trussell, director of Beth Israel, said the hospital, besides backing up the Planned Parenthood clinic, would con tinue its own program of about 2,000 abortions a year. Mr. Moran said the Planned Parenthood clinic would “give patients an alternative to the commercial profit‐making abor tion services that currently op erate in the city, charge higher fees and provide less adequate services.” In voluntary — private, non profit — hospitals, the cost of an early‐stage abortion routine ly ranges from $300 to $400. In proprietary hospitals, the total fee regularly exceeds $500. The concept of the nonprofit clinic has been endorsed by Gordon Chase, the city's Health Services Administrator, and by the state's Department of ?ealth. Planned Parenthood of New York City is the largest affili ate of Planned Parenthood World Population, a national organization for family plan ning.

110-> Elvira Calvo, W. E. Kock Jr. Married Here
Miss Elvira Beatriz Calvo Lafuente, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Alfonso D. Calvo of Buenos Aires, was married here yesterday morning to Winston Edward Kock Jr., son of Mr. and Mrs. Kock of Ann Arbor, Mich., and Governour's Harbor, Eleuthera, the Bahamas. The ecumenical ceremony was performed at the Church Center for the United Nations by the Rev. Dr. Carl D. Soule of the Church Center and the Rev. John P. Casaubon, a Roman Catholic priest. A reception was held in the afternoon at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Vladimir P. Fekula, friends of the couple, who were the witnesses at the wedding. The bride is a psychologist with the Puerto Rican Community Development Project here, which is part of the Human Resources Administration and the Manpower Career Development Agency, and is doing graduate work at the American Institute of Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis. She was graduated from El Salvador University in Buenos Aires with master's degrees in clincal psychology and diplomacy and received a master's degree in industrial psychology from Teachers College, Columbia University. Her father, who is retired, was president of South Amerlean International, meat and fruit exporters. Her mother is retired superintendent of schools in Buenos Aires. The bridegroom, a vice president for Tiede Enterprises, a media sales company, was graduated in 1961 from Washington and Lee University, attended the University of Michigan Law School and received an M.B.A. degree in 1967 from the University of Cincinnati. His father, who holds 88 patents, retired as vice president and chief scientist with the Bendix Corporation, Southfield, Mich., and is a consultant to Bendix.

111-> Curfew in Southern Pines Ordered in Racial Violence
SOUTHERN PINES, N. C., Oct. 24 (AP)—A state of emer gency was declared and a cur few was imposed today follow ing a second night of scattered racial violence in this resort town in the south‐central part of the state. An 8 P.M. to 5 A.M. curfew was ordered by Mayor E. Earl Hubbard after 100 to 150 per sons pelted a police car with rocks and bottles this morning. The police said the incident came after a car occupied by whites armed with guns drove into a black neighborhood. Of ficers said two occupants of the car were arrested. Tension has been running high since last week when fighting among Negro and white pupils forced officials to close Pinecrest High School. The school will remain closed tomorrow. The school has 1,600 pupils, almost 600 of them Ne gro.

112-> ECOLOGY IS BASIS FOR ZONING RULING
POUGHKEEPSIE, N. Y., Sept. 30 — A State Supreme Court Justice, deciding on ecological grounds alone, has denied a builders' petition to overturn zoning ordinance of the town of Wappinger. The builder, Nattin Realty, Inc., of Rockland County, sued the town's building inspector and zoning administrator, Joseph E. Ludewig, to force him to issue building permits for 342 apartment units in an area zoned as a one‐family residential district. The land, owned by the developer, is known as Riverdale and overlooks the Hudson River 10 miles south of Poughkeepsie. Justice Joseph F. Hawkins of Poughkeepsie ruled: “Upon thorough review of the trial minutes and briefs, as well as the authority cited by the parties, it appears the courts must consider a new criterion in reviewing zoning legislation: the factor of ecology. “Respecting ecology as a new factor, it appears that the time has come—if, indeed, it has not already irretrievably passed—for the courts, as it were, to take ‘ecological notice’ in zoning matters.” Mr. Ludewig had denied building permits on the ground that the new apartments would overburden the area's water and sewage resources. Nattin Realty also sought to upset an amendment to the town's zoning ordinance enacted March 9, 1970, in which the town changed the classification of the Riverdale district from multiple‐dwelling units to one‐family units. Justice Hawkins denied this plea, too, saying there was no need to consider the constitutionality of the amendment because it was intended to assure residents of large, multiple‐dwelling projects an adequate water supply, which is not available at Riverdale. “The municipality has here presented sufficient evidence to warrant the rezoning of the petitioners' property,” the Hawkins decision said, “for it was prompted to do so by ecological considerations based not upon whim or fancy but upon scientific findings. “The definition of public health, safety and welfare surely must now be broadened to include and to provide for these belated recognized threats and hazards to the public weal. The town's decision to forgo what undoubtedly would be substantial additional tax revenue would appear to constitute a recognition that it as well as an owner must subordinate immediate to longterm interest.”

113-> The Environmental Conflict
Fresh air and clean water and a healthy environment are essential if human beings are to enjoy a life worth living on this crowded planet. But economic growth is necessary if the nation is to avoid worsening unemploy ment and a depressed standard of living. Last week President Nixon managed to position himself on both sides of this complex issue. On Monday the President sent to Congress a message on the environment which was comprehensive and pro gressive. On Wednesday, speaking to the National Industrial Pollution Control Council, which includes the officers of many major polluters, he said reassuringly, “I do not see the problem of cleaning up the environment as being one of the people versus business, of govern ment versus business.” These cheery informal remarks about harmony do not invalidate the specific recommendations of his mes sage to Congress, but they do point up the problem in herent in the contemporary drive for improved environ mental quality. Economics and ecology do not always go hand in hand. Installing expensive pollution‐control equipment and processes may be corporate good citizen ship but that is not necessarily good for profits. The costs cannot always be passed on to the consumer the form of higher prices. A change‐over may give a competitor a temporary but costly advantage. As Adlai Stevenson used to say, “There are no gains without pains.” There is the deeper problem of motivation. A corpo rate manager has his attention focused on profit targets and production schedules. He has a natural resistance to taking into account environmental costs, some of which may be invisible, incalculable or very long‐term. A kind of reorientation or re‐education is going to have to occur if ecological considerations are going to enter decisively into his thinking. President Nixon perhaps did his business audience a disservice in suggesting to them that this transition can be smooth or effortless. Probably it can only come about, at least in part, by the clash—sometimes angry and noisy—of businessmen with government officials and citizen conservationists who instinctively put en vironmental values ahead of profits in every situation. It is unhelpful to suggest, as the President did, that these battles‐invofve a search for “scapegoats” or an effort “to beat business, over the head.” No sophisticated conservationist thinks of individual corporate managers as villains. Indeed, many dedicated conservationists are themselves business executives. What is involved is a conflict of values. It is the conflict between those who see man as masters of the earth, free to mine its topsoil or befoul the water or darken the sky if economic necessity requires such action, and those who see man as the earth's guests with the responsibilities and good manners of a guest. In this philosophical conflict, the President refuses commit himself. He proposes many excellent environ mental measures which please conservationists, but he‐often talks the old‐fashioned language of the profits first businessman. This ambiguity extends to his actions. His relentless fight for the supersonic transport plane goes counter to his proposals on air and noise pollution. Except for water sewage treatment plants, his budget requests are substantially below Congressional authori zations. The harmony between business, conservationists and government in the environmental field which the Presi dent proclaims is theoretically attainable. But it can only come about through a fundamental reconciliation of the differing philosophies now held by the various participants. No such reconciliation is likely to evolve if the President and other leaders believe that the con flict between environmental values and growth‐as‐usual can be evaded or papered over.

115-> Defense and Smart Money
All the talk by the Nixon Administration about reorder ing national priorities from a wartime to a peacetime economy has not caused Wall Street to lose sight of the fact that—if the President has his way—the defense budget will actually be going up by $6 billion in budget authority for military and military assistance programs in the next fiscal year. Stock‐market investors were quick to anticipate the potential impact of this budget turnaround on the for tunes of the ailing companies in the aerospace industry. From the end of 1970 to Feb. 3, while all industrial shares listed in Standard & Poor's Index were rising by 5.1 per cent, all aerospace companies climbed by 27.2 per cent. Some individual changes have been spectacular. Gen eral Dynamics is up 52 per cent since the start of the year. Litton Industries is up 38 per cent since year‐end and up 95 per cent from its 1970 low. McDonnell Douglas is up 30 per cent since the turn of the year, and has risen 111 per cent from its 1970 low. Even Lockheed, with all its ills, climbed spectacularly until the latest blow from Rolls‐Royce started it back downhill again. The explanation seems plain enough. Informed investors realize that the Administration is shifting resources heavily from military manpower to hardware. This is the reordering of priorities that the stock market is registering.

116-> Advertising:
Among the more interesting agency growth stories of this year has been what is happening at Rosenfeld, Sirowitz & Lawson, now billing at the rate of about $22‐million. According to Tom Lawson, the young president who joined the agency early this year, R. S. & L. landed eight of the 11 advertisers it presented to this year. Most of the time, according to Tom Lawson, the initial contact has been made by the agency saying to a prospective client, “Look, you ought to talk to us; we have a new way of doing business.” He was with his partner, Ron Rosenfeld, the other day when he explained the “new way.” First of all, the agency uses what it chooses to call the “triangular work unit,” which means an account man, copywriter and art director, all senior people, working together constantly on assignments. That cuts out the approval layers for which the large agencies are well known. Then the agency has all media buying and research work done by outsiders but planned and controlled on the inside by Gene DeWitt and Paula Drillman, respectively. That cuts down on overhead. The agency, begun in February, 1970, as Harper, Rosenfeld, Sirowitz and later renamed Rosenfeld, Sirowitz has shown its best growth since Tom Lawson came aboard. “Everything has fallen into place,” said Ron Rosenfeld, “Len [Sirowitz] and I always realized we needed a guy who was strong in marketing as we were strong in our areas and Tom is the catalyst that's pulled it all together.” He also mentioned synergism. Everybody does sooner or later.

117-> RANGERS TRIUMPH OVER CANUCKS, 6‐1, EXTENDING STRING
Without a flaw—not even while fighting—the Rangers made the willing but overmatched Vancouver Canucks their sixth straight victims last night with a 6‐1 trouncing at Madison Square Garden. But the New Yorkers finally showed they were only human. They failed to score in the third period, ending a string of goalgetting in 13 straight periods. The triumph, though, gave them a 14‐game unbeaten streak (11 victories, three ties). They also increased their lead in the East Division of the National Hockey League to 3 points over Montreal. While Pete Stemkowski watched from the stands, his replacement at center, Bobby Rousseau, paced the Rangers with two goals and an assist. Rousseau is an exciting player, and his years of outstanding play with the Montreal Canadiens have left their mark on his style. It is totally goaldirected. “If the puck is there,” he said after the game, “you got to try to get to it.” His goal total now is eight in 17 games, double the number he scored in 68 games for the Minnesota North Stars last season. Rousseau, who wears a helmet, has been skating with Bruce MacGregor, another who keeps his head covered and Ted Irvine. Would Irvine consider wearing a helmet, too? “I have false teeth, I wear contact lenses,” Irvine replied. “If I put on a helmet I'd never have time to get dressed.” In the Canucks the Rangers faced a squad with two of the most exciting youngsters in the National Hockey League Jocelyn Gouvrement and Dale Tallon. The Canucks, though, appear to be quick with their sticks, perhaps out of frustration. Their coach, Hal Laycoe, insists: “We're not a dirty hockey club. No club in the league is trying harder not to commit penalties.” Neither sticks nor stones, however, could have stopped the Rangers. They outshot the Canucks, 52‐16, giving New York 98 shots for the weekend action. Again, their defensemen ripped off blast after blast from the blue line. Their centers fed them passes so expertly it appeared the club was on a constant power play. “When the defense is getting off shots like that,” said Coach Emile Francis, “it means that the forwards are controlling the puck and the man in the slot is keeping the other players occupied. That frees the defense.” Brad Park, the No. 1 defenseman on the team, got his fifth goal to begin the scoring. Jean Ratelle sandwiched a goal between two by Rousseau in the first period also. MacGregor's goal, his 10th of the season, in the second period was followed by Jack Eger's tally, on which Jim Neilson, a defenseman, picked up his second assist of the game and 13th of the season. Perhaps to keep himself occupied, Gilles Villemure did some stickhandling in the second period, eluding Orland Kurtenbach of the Canucks.

118-> Bond Men Expect Rates to Fall More
All parts of the credit market last week rallied for the second week in a row, and everyone wants to know the unknowable: Will interest rates continue to decline? Right now, the dominant view among bond traders and invest ment bankers is that rates will keep moving downward. The forecast last week by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette helped solidify this optimistic outlook, and the supply of bonds for sale over the near future also should work in favor of lower rates, many bond men now assert. Corporate bond prices last week advanced sharply, making the biggest gain since mid March. The rise over the last two weeks has been large enough to bring yields on AA rated utility bonds to 7.73 per cent from 8.32 per cent. Demand Sluggish The 7.73 per cent yield, how ever, has yet to prove attractive to investors. The $27‐million is sue of Kansas City Power and Light Company bonds offered originally last Thursday were estimated 35 per cent sold when the securities markets closed Friday afternoon. This week's schedule of cor porate bond sales will be rela tively light by 1971 standards. Only about 400 million of new issues are likely to be offered. Furthermore, June so far ap pears to have a comparatively light schedule. According to Salomon Brothers' calculations, the total volume for June now stands at more than $2‐billion. Of this total, convertible issues account for $500‐million. The major corporate bond sales tentatively scheduled this week include: TUESDAY Western Electric Company, $100‐million debentures, due 1996, rated AAA by Moody's, to be sold by a syndicate co‐managed by First Boston and Goldman Sachs. Northern Natural Gas Company, 560‐mil lion debentures, due 1991, rated A, Birth. Net Corporation, $30.million convertible debentures, due 1996, Dean Witter. Atlanta Gas Light Company, SW.million bonds, due 1977, rated A, and 80,000 shares of preferred stock, Stone & Webster Securities. Colorado National Bankshares, $10‐million convertible debentures, due 1996, Eastman Dillon. WEDNESDAY Falcanbridge Nickel Mines, $50.million debentures, due 1996, rated A, Dillon Read. Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Government‐insured Merchant Marine bonds, due 1989, First Boston. THURSDAY Georgia Power Comeany, $190‐million bonds, due 2001, rated AA, competitive bid ding. Several new corporate issues were announced or filed with Government agencies late last week. Walt Disney Productions registered a $100‐million issue of 25‐year convertible deben tures with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Proceeds from the offering, to be made by a Lehman Brothers ‐ Kidder Peabody group, will be used chiefly to help finance the Walt Disney World complex, scheduled to open in Florida in October. The Consumers Power Com pany sought permission from Michigan to sell $120‐million of bonds. The Diamond Shamrock Corporation filed $60‐million of 25‐year sinking fund de bentures with the S.E.C. Gold man Sachs and Kuhn Loeb head the underwriters. Municipal bond volume this week will also be light. But tax‐exempt note sales will be, extremely heavy as New York, State and New York City to gether borrow more than $1.3‐ billion. Tax‐exempt bond prices last week rose more sharply than in any week since November. Like corporate bond under writers, tax‐exempt bond men face a relatively light volume of new issues this month. This week's schedule of tax exempt issues is expected to include the following: TUESDAY New York State, $1,029,000,000 notes. New York City, $308‐million budget notes. Department of Housing and Urban Develop ment, $247‐million project notes. New York State, $90‐milion bonds, due 1972–1991. University of Kentucky, $34.7‐million bonds, due 1972–7001. Memphis, $12‐million bonds, due 1972–1991. New Haven, $11‐million notes, due Decem ber 1971. WEDNESDAY New Madrid, Mo., $63.8‐million bonds. Alaska. 473.93‐million bonds, due 1972–1996. Troy School District, Mich., $24‐million bonds due 1975–2000. THURSDAY New Jersey Housing Finance agency, $52� million notes, due December, 1971. Late last week Florida dis closed plans to sell $152‐mil lion of highways bonds on June 15 and California an to be sold June 22. In the Federal agency securities market, the Home Loan Banks will sell Thursday two bond issues totaling $500‐ million to help retire $650‐mil lion of 8.45 per cent bonds maturing June 25. In the new offering, $300‐ million will be two‐year, 11‐ month bonds due May 25, 1977 and $200‐million will be five‐year, 11‐month bonds ma turing May 25, 1977. The Home Loan Banks, the credit reservoir for savings, and loan associations, also an nounced that they had pur chased $62.5‐million of each of four issues maturing from June to September this year, reducing their debt outstand ing by $2350‐million.

119-> Hungarian Asks ‘Normal’ Trade Ties
A leading Hungarian busi ness official said here yester day that trade between the United States and his country could increase three or four times “were normal conditions to prevail.” Odon Kallos, the president of the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce, a Government agency, and head of a trade mission visiting the United States, made clear that by “normal conditions” he meant the granting to his coun try of most ‐ favored ‐ nation treatment, tariff terms equal to the best offered any nation, as well as, easier credits. Mr. Kallos, who headed a hardware manufacturing com pany before entering Govern ment service in early 1948, es timated that Hungarian exports to the United States this year would reach $11‐million, United States sales to Hungary would total about $50‐million. At a news conference at the commercial offices of the Hun garian Embassy to the United States at 150 East 58th Street, Mr. Kallos implied that he was optimistic that a meeting with Secretary of Commerce Mau rice H. Stans on Friday would lead to a friendlier trade cli mate. Mr. Stans bypassed Hungary during his recent trip to East ern Europe. On his stopover in Warsaw, Mr. Stans noted that the Nixon Administration had opened the way for long term credits to Rumania. During the 90‐minute news conference, which included of ferings of Hungarian brandy, wines, sweets and cookies, Mr. Kallos made clear that Hungary was not looking for direct American investments. Instead, he said, American companies were welcome to join with Hungarian companies in ven tures to produce and market in third countries. Noting that about 100 such ventures existed with Western companies, Mr. Kallos said Hungarians had developed technologies on their own in such varied fields as prefabri cated housing or in the manu facture of small rechargeable batteries. Asked to list some priorities in Hungary's current five‐year plan, Mr. Kallos singled out petrochemicals, the building industry, agricultural machin ery and agricultural chemicals.

120-> U.S. and Soviet Discuss Modernizing Hot Line
VIENNA, March 31—Talks to “improve and modernize”, the Washington‐Moscow hot line opened here today be tween American and Soviet experts under the supervision of the two delegations to the talks on limiting strategic arms. An American spokesman announced the move today. The first meeting was held in the Soviet Embassy. The direct link was agreed on by President Kennedy and the then Soviet Premier, Nikita S. Khrushchev, after the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. It took several months before the agreement could be put into practice and the line was opened in 1963. The hot line is a permanent Telex link via London, Copen hagen, Stockholm and Hel sinki. There is an alternate radio link via Tangiers to be used for service messages or in technical difficulty. The messages are in code,

121-> National Notes
The nation's construction unions said “No” last week, and they said it twice. Meeting in Florida, leaders of the Buildings and Construction Trades Depart ment of the A.F.L.‐C.I.O. de clared that they would fight a proposed new Federal regulation requiring them to take on a specific quota of nonwhite ap prentices. And they added their determination to ignore a re quest by President Nixon that they come up with a program to stabilize wages in the build ing industry. The proposed new apprentice ship rules were placed in The Federal Register on Jan. 29 by Secretary of Labor James D. Hodgson, and will become bind ing unless rescinded by March 1. They will require unions with federally registered apprentice ship programs to adopt “af firmative action plans” to take on more nonwhites. According to an Equal Employment Op portunity Commission report issued last Monday, black mem bership in the building trades unions actually declined in 1969 from 7.4 per cent in 1968 to 6.8 per cent. The unions, however, said on Wednesday that “the goal of equal employment opportunity in apprenticeship has generally been achieved under existing regulations” and that “allega tions of discrimination on the basis of race in our, apprentice ship program is an emotional throwback based on reckless rhetorical and political pander ing.” The rules, they added, would “substitute quotas for quality” because the programs would be “inundated . . . with unqualified short‐term dropouts at the expense of dedicated future craftsmen.” And so they will fight the rules on Capitol Hill and in the Administration unless the Labor Department withdraws them. A day later, the unions zeroed In on President Nixon. They would not, they said, initiate or endorse any wage freezing or stabilizing program applied to the construction industry alone. If the President wants to freeze or stabilize wages, they said by implication, let him do it himself under Congressional authority that extends until March 31. The scene: Midtown Manhat tan. The action: All along the streets and avenues, shopkeep ers and employes are out in the sun, polishing plate glass win dows, sweeping the streets and gutters. The time: The near future. At least, that's the vision of a new association formed by 100 prominent businessmen and an nounced last week. The target area of the Association for a Bet ter New York will be from 34th to 57th Street between Second and Eighth Avenues where most of the major buildings are owned or managed by members of the association. A three‐year budget of $2.5‐million will get the program going. On top of the businessmen's plan there came another pro posal last week to set the mid town area aright. Mayor Lind say announced an approach (sub ject to approval of the City Plan ning Commission and the Board of Estimate) that might halt the march of sterile office buildings along Fifth Avenue. Under his plan, the area along Fifth from 38th to 59th Street would be designated a special retail district, and at least the two lower floors of any new buildings would have to be rent ed to retail tenants. The more extra space allotted to retail use, the higher the building could be. About 15 years ago, Dr. Wil liam H. Masters, then a St. Louis gynecologist, was about to em bark on what he hoped would be a unique study of human sex uality. He realized, however, that the work would require a female assistant. So he adver tised and among those answer ing the ads was a young di vorcee, Mrs. Virginia Johnson, a psychologist. Over the past 15 years, Dr. Masters and Mrs. Johnson have become world‐famous as scien tific collaborators, as heads of the Reproductive Biology Re search Foundation in St. Louis and as co‐authors of the best selling “Human Sexual Re sponse” in 1966 and “Human Sexual Inadequacy” published last year—classic studies of the sexual life of more than a thou sand representative people based on personal study and research. Now the Masters and Johnson collaboration has become even closer. It was announced last week that they were married in January in Fayetteville, Ark., in what Dr. Masters—divorced last summer—described as “just a private ceremony.” Though now married, professionally they will remain Masters and Johnson.

122-> State Senate Passes Welfare Changes
ALBANY, April 6—The Senate tonight passed a series of bills proposed by Governor Rockefeller to change the state's welfare system. Among the bills is one that strips the State Board of Social Welfare of its rule‐making powers by transferring them to the Social Services Commissioner. The bills were passed and sent to the Assembly although the Senators—particularly the minority Democrats—had only minutes to review them. The Senate then adjourned for an Easter recess until April 20. The Assembly will meet tomorrow and is expected to take a similar holiday break. The bill reducing the State Board of Social Welfare to essentially an advisory body was seen here as a successor to a measure approved by the Legislature last month that gives the Governor the power to appoint the Social Services Commissioner. Since the mid‐nineteen‐forties, the Social Welfare Board has had the responsibility of appointing the Commissioner, as a means of keeping the appointment apart from politics. The board was also empowered to require the Commissioner to carry out its directives. The bill granting autonomy to the Commissioner, which was described by Mr. Rockefeller's office as permitting the Social Services Department “to set the tone, direction and character of the welfare system,” will take effect July 1 if, as expected, it is passed in the Assembly. The Governor has recently advocated changes in the way welfare is administered in the state, and he has also indicated displeasure with the present Social Services Commissioner, George K. Wyman. Mr. Wyman's term expires June. 30 and there is speculation that the Governor will replace him. Other welfare measures given Senate approval tonight include the following: ¶A bill requiring home relief recipients, a welfare category paid for entirely by the state and by localities, “to perform such work as shall be assigned to them” by a local welfare official or the State Industrial Commissioner. It also disqualifies from welfare aid a person who refuses to work in “a public work project” l although deemed fit to do so. Several Democrats, citing Federal regulations governing such large welfare categories as aid to dependent children that ban requiring recipients to enroll in anything other than training programs, said the bill was “a political publicity stunt” to create the illusion that the Republicans were seriously cracking down on welfare cheats. “I don't think a thousand people in this state will be put to work on this,” said Senator Manfred Ohrenstein, Democrat of Manhattan. ¶A bill, conforming with new Federal regulations, that relieves caseworkers of the responsibility of determining welfare eligibility and assistance payments. The determination of eligibility is to be made by lower‐paid clerical help. ¶A requirement that recipients deemed employable must receive their welfare checks in person from the State Depart meat of Labor rather than in the mail. ¶A requirement that persons receiving public assistance be photographed for an identification card which may be asked for in order to cash relief checks. New York City tried this but found it expensive. ¶A bill that says that if a person transfers property within one year of the date he applied for welfare the transfer “shall be presumed to have been made for the purpose of qualifying for such assistance.” All the bills would take effect July 1. Other matters concerning the Legislature follow: The Governor submitted to the Legislature his proposal for a $2.5‐billion mass‐transportation bond issue with half the money earmarked for highway construction and the remainder for mass transit. The measure must be approved by the Legislature at the current session and the voters in November. The Senate shelved a bill that would have permitted New York City firemen to serve as volunteer firemen in their home communities. New York City Fire Commissioner Robert O. Lowery has barred such service. Senator John Caemmerer, Republican‐Conservative of East Williston, Li., said the measure would affect at least 600 city firemen who also serve as volunteers in their Long Island home communities. The measure had been passed by the Assembly and could be brought up for a vote again in the Senate.

123-> DUKE SETS BACK N. C. STATE, 41‐13
DURHAM, N.C., Oct. 16 (UPI) —Ernie Jackson scored two touchdowns today to spark Duke in a 41‐13 victory over North Carolina State. The 168‐pound speedster pulled two tacklers into the end zone with him on a 7‐yard run in the first quarter and leaped over from the 1 in the second period before leaving the game with a sprained ankle in the third period. Bill Thompson, who alternat ed at tailback with Jackson, also scored twice. His first touchdown came on a 1‐yard run in the second period and he plunged through the line late in the fourth quarter from a yard out. Dennis Sayshur of Duke scored on a 6‐yard run with 32 seconds left in the first half ?? and passed to Rusty McDow for a 16‐yard scoring play mid way in the third quarter. Willie Burden of North Caro lina State scored on a 7‐yard run in the second period and Bill Shaw passed to Steve Les ter on a 10‐yard scoring play late in the game. Satyshur pulled a fake field goal attempt on fourth down to set up Jackson's first touch down, passing to Bill Thompson instead to make it first and goal at the 10. Jackson set up, his own second tochdown with a 46‐yard punt return. ??

124-> Point of View
The new Securities Inves tors Protection Corporation is just the first step in a pro gram that will lead to reor ganization of the securities industry along more rational lines than it has had. The next steps will be directed toward development of a central marketplace suited to today's economic climate and toward a revenue structure that will allow brokerage firms to attract the perma nent capital they need. There is nothing like ad versity to focus attention on essentials. Wall Street has re learned from its latest crisis that the essentials of its business are the individual investor and the central mar ketplace. The growth of institution al investment from 31.4 per cent of transaction volume 10 years ago to 55.9 per cent currently should not obscure the fact that the confidence of millions of investors in the securities markets is one of the most important bases of our economic system. It is the individual whose money is at stake, directly or through mutual funds, trust accounts or pension funds. Public confidence is based on the proposition that cen tral exchange markets, bring ing together all buyers and sellers, could insure fair prices for all. But the inabil ity of exchange markets to adapt rapidly to increased in stitutional trading has led to a Topsy‐like growth of new methods and practices not necessarily in the public in terest. The central market I see on the horizon will have as one of its principal objectives revisions to counter this trend—to provide both insti tutional and individual inves tors with dependable execu tions. Artificial distinctions. will be erased. Differences in commission will reflect vari ations in cost, not advan tages of positioning. There will be a public record of all transactions. Constructing the new sys tem will not be easy. There are varying interests to be reconciled, and honest differ ences of opinion. But a con sensus is forming around the essential principles: Integrity of the central marketplace for determining values; equal access for all investors; price information available to all; the same ground rules for everybody playing the game. Confident that the market place is being run in its in terests, the American public will be willing to pay the real cost of maintaining it. The public has not been paying sufficient compensation. Inci dents of bad management figure in the disappearance of some firms, but the inade quate and inflexible com mission rate schedule and the capital structure it en gendered have been largely responsible for the loss of more firms over the last two years than from 1929 to 1940. No over‐all adjustment of commission rates has been made for 13 years, except for one reduction and the cur rent service charge [of $15 added to the published com mission on a transaction, or half the published charge if that charge is less than $30]. During that time the Con sumer Price Index has in creased by more than one third and the average wage has nearly doubled. Changes over the last decade toward a mass retail market for se curities have been accompa nied by major increases in cost. Even the massive cost cutting efforts of recent months left the break‐even point for the brokerage com munity as a whole well above 11 million shares. The average cost of han dling a single transaction of a group of representative firms has more than doubled since 1958—from $24.60 to $58.94. Between the summer of 1968 and the fall of 1970, the clerical cost per transac tion rose by more than 80 per cent and the cost of equipment rental soared 150 per cent. For business in general 1970 was the worst year in a decade; for Wall Street it was the worst in more than a generation. Brokerage loss es strained and in some in stances fatally impaired the capital bases of many firms. An industry whose reve nues can dip sharply while costs are going up, that must be geared to meet a peak load although volume can double overnight or shrink in half, becomes an extremely risky investment. Profits must rise inordinately in boom times, or revenues as well as costs must be subject to manage rial controls. The surcharge is a recognition that there is a cost aspect of transactions having nothing to do with the price of securities traded. Commission income should be simplified, readily adjust able and understandable. The industry must question wheth er a competitive commission structure meets those crite ria. Money involved—the dol lars in a transaction—ap pears to present one logical approach, rather than the historical criterion for charg es, a trading unit of shares. The securities industry has, at long last, come to grips with its future. It is, how ever, not an entirely free agent. The movement toward reconstructing the industry along rational lines will be difficult unless the Govern ment also assumes an intel ligently flexible attitude. Relations between Wall Street and the Securities and Exchange Commission have traditionally been good. But in recent years, neither has really kept up with changing times. The history of Ameri can railroads, in which an in ternal resistance to change was reinforced by an overly rigid regulatory scheme, also should be read as a caution ary table.

126-> U.S. Aides in Athens, Under. Fire, Defend Policy Favoring Regime
ATHENS, March 25 — United States diplomats in Athens, under fire from both Senate investigators in Washington and opponents of the military Government here, are shifting their tactics slightly but hold ing firm to the policy that they, and the State Department have formulated. The policy is rooted in de fense considerations, the strate gic position of Greece on the southern flank of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the value of Greek ports to ships of the United States Sixth Fleet and the need for Ameri can communications installa tions on Greek soil. While these were the consid erations leading to the resump tion of shipments of heavy arms last September, the State De partment declared at the time that the “trend toward a consti tutional order is established” in Greece. That judgment, disput ed by other knowledgeable dip lomatic observers, still holds. Although American officials here and in Washington are now more prone to express, worry about the hesitant pace toward constitutional order, they remain basically optimistic in public and private. The political result of the United States policy appears often as public support of the Government of Premier George Papadopoulos, installed in a swift, bloodless military coup d'état April 12, 1967. Responsible embassy officials insist that the appearance of support is supplemented by pri vate pressure on the Govern ment to honor its pledge to lift martial law and restore parlia mentary democracy. Public crit icism of the Government's fail ure to achieve these goals after nearly four years in power, they say, would only inflame tempers, which discreet diplo macy should seek to calm. Nonetheless, American rep resentatives have recently be gun to increase their contacts with leaders of the limited op position in Greece. Ambassador Henry J. Tasca, who met many of the better‐known anti‐Gov ernment spokesmen at a large official cocktail party a few months after he arrived here early last year, has recently in vited some of these men to his residence for dinner. Other officers, many of them even more recent arrivals than the Ambassador, have also taken to having Hinch with op position figures, who felt that, until now, they had been sys tematically ignored by Ameri cans. The level of contact is still too low to please many. Panayotis Kanellopoulos, the Premier deposed by the coup and still spokesman for the banned conservative Radical party, told a visitor recently that several Western ambassa dors call on him almost week ly. Mr. Tasca has not made such overtures, he added. Even before the 1967 coup, the United States Embassy maintained a form of boycott of suspected politicians. When the late Elias Tsirimokos was designated to be Premier in the troubled political summer of 1965, Americans discovered that because Mr. Tsirimokos had fought with Communist parti sans during World War II, they had had no official contact with him in 17 years. Opponents of the Govern ment are also irked by what they see as United States aid to the Government's internal propaganda efforts. This help, beyond technical assistance to Greek armed forces television broadcasters, takes the public form of frequent press photos of Premier Papadopoulos, who is also Defense Minister; receiv ing visiting American military men. The most recent photograph of the sort, given front‐page display March 20 by pro‐Gov ernment papers, showed the Premier shaking hands with Gen. Joseph Moore. The United States Air Force general, com mander of the Sixth Tactical Allied Air. Force, was making farewell calls in Greece. Worse than the military pub licity, others maintain, is the apparent practice of sending youngsters from the official school for children of the American community to sing Christmas carols for the Pre mier. The last such visit re sulted in a three‐column pic ture of the smiling Premier amid the youthful songsters on the front page of the pro‐Gov ernment paper, Eleftheros Kos mcg, last December. By contrast, it was noted that American officials ap parently had been unable to secure the release from island exile of Miss Rita Plpinopoulou, a secretarial employe of the Fulbright Educational Commis sion since 1963. Suspected of subversive activity, she was or dered to enforced residence on the remote island of Kythera March 1, 1970, and returned to Athens last Dec. 28. Embassy officials said that some Government officials have criticized them privately for promptly reinstating Miss Pi pinopoulou. They also said they were considering paying her for the months she was absent from her job. Such a gesture would hearten opposition forces. Few think, however, that gestures will still the constant criticism of United States policy and the diplomats who carry it out. One recent summation of this criticism came from James G. Lowenstein and Richard M. Moose, staff investigators of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. After spending the first week in February in Athens inquiiing into Ameri can policy, they issued a staff report, which both embassy and opposition figures say was largely fair. Greece's official foreign affairs spokesman said it was “lacking in seriousness.” The report's concluding para graph found that “rightly or wrongly, most Greeks believe that the United States supports the regime” and added that this belief “constitutes the regime's greatest asset and at the same time provides the United States with its most effective political leverage.” “As far as the pursuit of our declared objectives in the politi cal sphere is concerned, how ever,” the investigators said, “this potential leverage does not seem to have been effec tively applied. The policy of friendly persuasion has clearly failed. “The regime has accepted the friendship, and the military as sistance, but has ignored the persuasion. Indeed, the regime seems to have been able to ex ert more leverage on us with regard to military assistance than we have been willing to exert on the regime with regard to political reform. We see no evidence that this will not con tinue to be the case.”

127-> HOUSE DEMOCRATS ASK PULLOUT BY '73
WASHINGTON, March 31 — House Democrats called today for an end to United States involvement in Indochina by the start of 1973. The action was almost identi cal to that taken by Senate Democrats a month ago. It was the first time that the House Democratic majority had spo ken out on the issue. A resolution, approved by a vote of 138 to 62, went further than some Democratic Repre sentatives, including Carl Al bert, the Speaker, had original ly wanted. At the same time, it fell short of demands of the lead ing doves, who had pushed for total troop withdrawals from Southeast Asia by the end of this year. Some indication of the sharp division within Democratic ranks was expressed by Repre sentative Teno Roncalio of Wy oming as he emerged from the three‐hour closed caucus. “There is a feeling of to getherness in there,” he said wryly. “Everyone is reasonably unhappy.” As finally adopted, the reso lution represented a compro mise hammered out in recent days between House leaders and antiwar forces. The resolution states the fol lowing: “Resolved, that it is the sense of the Democratic caucus of the House of Representatives that in the 92d Congress the House Representatives should work to end the United States military involvement in Indo china and to bring about the release of all prisoners in time certain during the 92d Congress. “Resolved, further, that in pursuit of these objectives, the Democratic caucus urges full support wherever possible by both House Democrats and Re publicans of the initiatives of the President, the House com mittees and members, and the Senate, which may be perti nent to these ends.“ While the resolution was adopted by a wide margin, the crucial vote came earlier when the Democrats voted, 101 to 100, to substitute the compro mise for the more stringent proposal for withdrawal of troops this year. Thus, by a mere one‐vote margin, the Democrats blocked all chances for a vote on with drawing troops this year. The more militant antiwar spokesmen in the House including Mrs. Bella Abzug of Manhattan and Ronald V. Deelums of California—termed the caucus action “a victory for Nixon.” Much the same view was ex pressed by the House Republi can leader, Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, who applauded the Democratic action as one strengthening the President “in the courageous course he is pursuing.” More generally, however, the Democratic action Was viewed as a major step in forcing the President to step up efforts to end the war. “Sure, we didn't get as much as we wanted,” said Repre sentative Sam Gibbons of Florida, one of five co‐sponsors of the proposal for total troop withdrawals by the end of this year. “But you've got to con sider where we came from. A month ago, we didn't stand chance of getting any antiwar resolution through caucus.” In forcing the issue to vote in caucus, leaders of the antiwar resolution had to over come earlier opposition of Olin E. Teague of Texas, chair man of the House Democratic Caucus, Dr. Thomas E. Morgan, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Mr. Al bert. Dr. Morgan, a supporter of the war politics of bath the Johnson and Nixon Adminis trations, said he was satisfied with the caucus action. Asked what message he felt it conveyed to President Nixon, Dr. Morgan replied: “I would consider this a directive, from Democrats in both branches of Congress, that this war has to be wound down during this session of Congress.” He said that his committee would open hearings, shortly after Easter, into various anti war proposals introduced in the last few months. Mr. Albert, too, said he was satisfied with the compromise. He termed it neither “a slap at President Nixon” nor “a vote of confidence in his conduct of the war.” Sponsors of the original pro posal for troop withdrawals this year said they would con tinue to exert pressure on the Administration to end the war.

128-> Parliament in India Condemns Pakistani ‘Massacre’ in East
NEW DELHI, March 3—The Indian Parliament accused Pakistan today of a “massacre of defenseless people” in East Pakistan that “amounts to geno cide.” Parliament also assured the East Pakistanis “that their struggle and sacrifices will receive the wholehearted sym pathy and support of the people of India.” [According to Reuters, a Pakistan radio broadcast monitored in New Delhi to day said that the Pakistani Government had accused India of infiltrating armed troops into border areas of East Pakistan.] The Indian condemnation of the Pakistani Government, based in West Pakistan, and the expression of solidarity with the Bengali people of East Pakistan came in a resolution introduced by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and adopted unanimously in both houses to applause, cheers and thumping of benches. Sitting in the diplomatic gal lery in the lower house was Mrs. Sajjad Haider, wife of the Pakistani High Commissioner in New Delhi. India and the two wings of Pakistan, all once Brit ish India, are members of the Commonwealth and maintain high commissioners rather than ambassadors in each others' countries. Meanwhile, the picture of the fighting in East Pakistan re mained confused, with all normal news channels blacked out. There were no broadcasts to day by transmitters identifying themselves as voices of the re sistance forces. The East Paki stanis have said they have set up a provisional government for Bangle Desh, or Bengal Nation. The radio silence could mean that the Pakistani army consisting of West Pakistanis, has tightened its control on the cities, where it generally be lieved here the transmitters have been situated. The Government's radio spoke of “restoration of peaceful con ditions in all major cities and the entire countryside” and said that the province was “gradu ally preparing itself to resume normal economic life.” The fighting began last Thursday night when the army struck against the indepen dence movement led by Sheik Mujibur Rahman and his Awami League, East Pakistan's dominant political party. In elections last December, it won a clear majority in the National Assembly, which was to have met March 3 to start writing a constitution to end the military rule of Pakistan. At that time, the Awami League was de manding regional autonomy. But President Agha Moham mad Yahya Khan postponed the assembly, and strikes and other protests followed in East Pakistan, with the Awami League gradually taking over control of the province. The resolution adopted today by the Indian Parliament did not come as a surprise, since India and Pakistan — mainly Hindu and mainly Moslem— are enemies, and have fought two wars, the last in 1965. Still, the resolution made In dia the first nation to condemn Pakistan for the recent events, and the wording was particu larly sharp. “This house demands im mediate cessation of the use of force and the massacre of de fenseless people. This house calls upon all people and gov ernments of the world to take urgent and constructive steps to prevail upon the Govern ment re Pakistan to put an end immediately to the systematic decimation of people, which amounts to genocide. This house records its profound con viction that the historic up surge of the 75 million people of East Bengal will triumph.” India anal Pakistan have often sought to embarrass each other in the eyes of the world, and there is undoubtedly some die ment of this in Mrs. Gandhi's resolution, which was worked out in advance with all the Opposition parties. Pakistan, which insists the conflict is a domestic matter, has accused India of inter ference in her internal affairs. East Pakistan and West Paki stan are separated by over 1,000 miles, with India be tween. The West, though it has fewer people, has always domi nated the East economically, politically and militarily.

129-> FLORIDA IN UPSET OF FLORIDA STATE
GAINESVILLE, Fla., Oct. 16 (UPI)—Richard Franco of Flori da kicked a 42‐yard fourth quarter field goal today as the Gators, previously without a victory, handed Florida State its first loss, 17‐15. Franco's boot gave the Gators a 17‐7 lead and then the Gator defense shut off a furious Semi nole passing attack in the clos ing seconds after Florida State had closed within two points with 3 minutes 2 seconds re maining. The Florida State quarter back, Gary Huff, hit Rhett Daw son with a 6‐yard scoring pass to cut the margin to 17‐13 and teamed with Dawson again for a 2‐point conversion toss. The Seminoles got the ball again with 2:10 left. Huff hit three straight passes to the Gator 49 before he was decked for a 10‐yard loss. Huff hit Dawson on the Gator 28 on the next play, but Dawson dropped the ball as he hit the ground and the pass was ruled incomplete, ending the threat. ??

131-> BANKERS WILL LEND TO MINORITY BANKS
WASHINGTON, July 22 (AP) —Commercial banks have set up an investment company called Minibanc with projected assets of $3‐million to $10‐mil lion to lend capital to minority owned banks, the American Bankers Association announced yesterday. Thomas W. McMahon Jr., chairman of the association's urban affairs committee and executive vice president of the Chase Manhattan Bank, said that at present the 29 black, one Puerto Rican and five Mex ican‐American banks have total capital investment of $25 mil lion. Twenty‐two minority banks have operated as full‐service banks for three years or more, one criterion for getting a Mini banc loan. Other criteria, Mr. McMahon said, are “the extent to which eligible minority‐owned banks” find “traditional sources of cap ital” blocked to them, their handicaps resulting from insuf ficient capital and their ability to invest the loan promptly, profitably and safely. Only banks that are members of the association may invest in Minibanc and no bank may own more than 5 per cent of its outstanding shares. The cor poration also may buy tem porarily a maximum of 20 per cent of voting securities in minority bank.

132-> FOREIGN AFFAIRS
ROME—Italy's political enfant ter rible, Giorgio Almirante, is an avowed ex‐Fascist whose adversaries call him neo‐Fascist and who is certainly at least quasi‐Fascist. Mild mannered, quiet, he prefers to think of himself as a “qualitative democrat” who fa vors liberty for everybody except the Communists, whom he would outlaw. He wants constitutional amendments to give the president strong executive powers, and providing for arbitration of labor disputes. Nevertheless, Almirante decries to talitarianism, dictatorship or single party states. He says only that he wishes to end the divorce between the Italian people and their politicians, provide direct popular election of the president, and end the corruption and disorganization which plague the re public. His M.S.I., the Italian SociSI Move ment, was merely one of several un successful right‐wing parties that have flickered on the Italian scene until, two years ago, Almirante assumed leadership. He has unified and ex panded its membership, replaced its old‐fashioned political vocabulary, and achieved an initial electoral victory. In last month's regional elections the M.S.I.'s local strength zoomed and, even more interesting, the Communists declined for the first time in years. At least part of the protest vote that has been backing Marxist candidates as a token of frustration obviously decided to swing right. Almirante has none of the flam boyance of erstwhile Fascists. Al though a brilliant orator with an un challenged record of bravery, he is quiet, distinguished‐looking, conserva tively dressed and speaks in a calm voice using unexcited language. He lives in a bourgeois apartment and likes to talk of modest personal ambi tions. Npw 57, he is the first of four gen erations in his Sicilian family who has not been on the stage. Almirante even wrote a play himself, at 22, but a theatrical‐minded uncle told him it was awful. He then wrote two novels “which were worse.” Had he too become an actor Al mirante would have been perfect for roles as the quiet English gentleman with his well‐cut features, green eyes, lean figure, gray mustache and balding head. Instead he became an active Fascist. He had a splendid war record and followed Mussolini to the end at the Salo Republic after the King took Italy over to the Allies. Almirante joined the new M.S.I. and edited its newspaper. Perhaps the inherited judgment of an actor makes him appear the least histrionic of Europe's postwar neo Fascist figures. He stresses the appear ance of respectable legality, has dropped Fascism's black flag (thus in curring support among.the armed forces), contends it is hard to envision a coup d'etat situation and insists he only wants to amend the constitution by normal procedures. He professes restrained interest in this year's presidential elections, pre ferring to concentrate on building M.S.I. strength for the 1973 parlia mentary vote. Obviously his hope is to gain enough strength to try to push Italy toward an “opening to the right” replacing today's “opening to the left” or center‐left regime. He is quietly negotiating with the dwindled Monarchist party, hoping it will dissolve and join the M.S.I. He also hopes many of the small Liberal party's members will enlist behind him and thus offer Italy “a genuine right.” He mentions limited aspirations—perhaps fifty deputies after the 1973 elections—instead of the present 25. But some of his enemies talk about dangerous rightward swing that might give Almirante a hundred deputies and the possibility of seriously ham pering democratic processes. It is hard to look even two years ahead in Italy and one remembers how, in the late 1940's, the strutting neo‐Fascist Giannini built up a huge movement called l'Uomo Qualunque which suddenly vanished like a bad dream. Almirante is certainly a weightier, more significant figure. He takes pains to minimize any menacing aspects of his movement. He has no strange gods, swearing only by Gianbattista Vico and Giovanni Gentile, without whom no one can understand Italian politics, and (as a former literature professor) by Dante, Pirandello and Verge. He proclaims a desire to emulate the great Christian Democrat, De Gas ped, who sought a “national Catholic and anti‐Communist force.” He eschews “the dark old past” and Mussolini's vainglorious slogans. Nevertheless he wants a powerful executive, enforced arbitration of strikes, and an out lawed Communist party. Whether this is low‐profile Fascism depends on vo cabulary identification, but it certain. ly means running Italy with a tight rein.

133-> Colt Players Questioning Value Of Finishing First in Division
Why finish first? The Baltimore Colts and the Miami Dolphins may ponder the question this week in advance of their game at Baltimore on Satur day. First place in the East ern Division of the American Conference will be at stake and the Dolphins currently lead the Colts by half a game. This division's first‐ place team is scheduled to meet in the playoffs the winner of the Western Division—Kansas City or Oakland. The East's second‐ place team will likely qualify for the playoffs, too, as the division runner‐up with the best won‐lost percentage within the conference. In the playoffs the runner‐up team will oppose the Cleve land Browns, the Central Di vision winner. The Browns, uneven and inconsistent, represent a much more palatable playoff opponent than do the Chiefs or Raiders. “You like to win things out right, but it really doesn't matter too much if we finish first or second,” said. Mike Curtis, the Colt linebacker. “Finishing first don't mean a damn thing,” said Bubba Smith, the Baltimore defen sive end. “It don't mean more money. All that matters is getting into the playoffs. Getting there matters a great deal to the Detroit Lions, whose loss to the Eagles dimmed their hopes considerably. “I can't believe we're in this situation,” said Mike Lucci, linebacker and captain. “We're too good. We've made too many mis takes.” Added Coach Joe Schmidt: “We played lousy. The penal ties screwed us up. You only see that junk on sandlots. Somebody is going to have to lose big ones for us to make it now.” The Lions play the Vikings on Saturday. The Vikings have problems of their own and Al Denson, a receiver who quit the team rather than accept demotion to the taxi squad, lifted the curtain. “They've got men out there who can't tote my shoestrings,” said. Denson. He had 10 pass receptions on the season to none for John Henderson, his replace ment, and only seven for Gene Washington, the big touchdown threat. Washing ton had 44 last season. The Vikings have used three quarterbacks, all of whom have ignored Washington. After Minnesota's loss to San Diego, Carl Eller of the Vikings said, “A loose team can always upset one that is going for a championship.” Oakland, another worried playoff candidate, lost to a loose Warn in Atlanta and Mary Hubbard, the Raider fullback, criticized Daryle Lamonica, the quarterback, for having called passes rather than running plays near the goal. “I asked for the off‐tackle play several times, but was ignored,” he said. Hubbard also called for a team meeting “to clear the air.” As for Paul Brown, he did not seem to mind that his team, Cincinnati, had lost to Cleveland and been elimi nated. “Actually this is good,” he said. “We need a high draft position.” The Dallas Cowboys are one outfit full of confidence. “Momentum is on our side,” said Tom Landry, coach of the East's leader in the Na tional Conference. “With Calvin Hill in there against the Jets, we were in the best physical condition in four or five weeks. I can't remember when our first unit looked as good as in the first quarter.”

134-> Ecology Exhibit on Capital Mall Is Planned by U.S. Park Service
WASRINGTON, May 1—The National Park Service is devel oping a 12‐acre exposition here to show how man must learn to redeem the environment he has polluted. The exposition will include demonstrations of the simplest to the most sophisticated de vices for cleansing the air and water, a pollution‐free pond using recycled water and sup ported aquatic life and a 500‐ seat outdoor amphitheater for seminars and forums on en vironmental problems. It will also include a crafts village for demonstrations of a wide variety of craft work, to emphasize man's disciplines and work, and “grass roots” folk performances to dramatize man's leisure time. It may ultimately include a living laboratory, an inflated plastic dome to show a clean world with an unpolluted at mosphere. A visitor could step out of his polluted world and make instant comparisons of plants and trees growing in clean air with those growing outside amid the effects of pol lution. The exposition is to be con structed on the Mall between the Reflecting Pool at the Lin coln Memorial and Constitution Avenue, where until last year, World War I “temporary” Navy ‐ munitions buildings blighted the area. The buildings were razed last summer at the direction of President Nixon as part of a plan to beautify the capital. As conceived by the plan ners the exposition is to be a major tourist attraction geared particularly to individuals mo tivated to carry home the en vironmental clean‐up message. The exposition is now re garded as temporary. The White House, through Secretary of the Interior Rogers C. B. Morton and George B. Hartzog Jr., director of the park service, au thorized ithe exposition to en able the public to use the site until a permanent plan can be devised. It could run for two or 10 years, the planners said. The park planners have called the exposition “humanisphere.” Some elements may be ready by mid‐July. These may include the crafts village, the outdoor ex hibit of technological devices for cleaning water and air, the small stream and pond, the am phitheater and a small inflated plastic dome for exhibits yet to be chosen. The concept of other parts of the exposition, including the “clean world” dome, and a demonstration or recycling waste water from public facili ties on the grounds and perhaps even from the polluted Potomac River, are stil in the planning stage. The park service planners emphasized that they sought to preserve the integrity of the exposition land and its concept. One park service official said “we will not permit any wide open showmanship.” “We want to demonstrate that all segments of the society, government, industry, business, and individuals, particularly our youth, can work together in a sort of national community meeting place to work out our environmental problems.” He ruled out any. “commercialism” or efforts by industry to use it as a showcase for their anti pollution works. Much of the initial work will be done by volunteers, the plan ners hope. For example, they said, youth groups from Wash ington and surrounding com munities will be enlisted to build the crafts village. Under the leadership of experts, they will erect eight Mongolian sheep‐herders' huts, known as yurts, in which weavers or pot ters or iron mongers can show “man at work.” The crafts, Indian, folk and contemporary, will be changed from time to time to give varie ty. The handicraft products will be sold to the public. Initially, the work will cost under $100,000. This includes work now being done on the site, including proper drainage, landscaping and sodding. There was no estimate of what the entire plan would cost because, officials said, ideas for the ex position were still evolving as private industry, other Govern ment agencies and individuals fed them in.

135-> CON EDISON SEEKS A 142% INCREASE IN ELECTRIC RATE
Consolidated Edison asked the state yesterday for elec tricity rate increases of 11.4 to 15.3 per cent from all three million of its residential and commercial customers in the city and Westchester County. The increases would push the bill of the average city family using 250 kilowatt hours month up from $11.04 to $12.61, a rise of 14.2 per cent. The rises would range from 21 cents to $2.70 a month. The request, filed with the Public Service Commission, is aimed at bringing a 14.9 per cent increase in the company's annual revenues. Con Edison's vice president for public affairs, Robert O. Lehrman, said the revenue increase was needed to improve the utility's rate of return to attract financing for a $2.2‐billion construction pro gram at an economical level. The program includes eight million kilowatts of new power facilities in various stages of construction. “Right now we are prac tically certain to have brown outs—drops in voltage—this summer and we are doing all we can to avoid load‐shedding which would interrupt service to some of our customers, as happened to 1 per cent for 90 minutes last year,” he said. “This construction program will lead us out of our present capacity shortage. But we can not attract the investors needed to carry out the program with out rate relief to increase the return on our investment in the near future.” The company's actual rate of return for 1970, as a result of the rate increase in September, was 5.85 per cent, or with ex traordinary costs removed, 6.38 per cent, he said. “The Public Service Commis sion found in our 1970 electric rate case that a fair rate of return was 7.28 per cent,” said Mr. Lehrman The judgment was based on 1968–69, not 1970, costs. Asked what rate of return on total investment was sought by the new increases, he said, “on total investment, 8.01 per cent.” He added that on equity capital, the portion of the in vestment provided by security owners, “the return will work out around 12 per cent.” The increases sought would yield $142.8‐million a year on 1970's billings, the company estimated. Growth in the use of electricity by 1972 was ex pected to increase this sum to $154‐million. Mr. Lehrman said that “se vere inflationary pressures” had affected the company's fi nancial position adversely. The revenue from electricity sales was low in relation to interest costs. Investors are concerned with how well earn ings from operations covered such costs. Hence, the official said, “Con Edison's stock continues to sell below book value,” re ferring to its value as indicated by the excess of assets over liabilities. The request showed That The days when rates for public util ity services lagged Willie con sumer prices moved up rapidly are definitely over. Both manufactured gas and electricity costs will move up automatically because fuel costs are rising, and these charges are passed along to The cus tomer in fuel rate adjustments. With natural gas in short supply, gas rates are expected to move up, Central Hudson baying led New York state utilities in ap plying for an increase. The city has already raised water rates for urban custom ers and is seeking an increase from suburban and null sys tems it supplies. Mr. Lehrman said that in this year and 1972 the company needed $1.05‐billion for con struction. About $700‐million of this must be raised by the sale or securities or through other means of outside financing, he said. On this account, Mr. Lehr man explained, the company also asked the commission for a temporary rate increase of 10 per cent, yielding $95.8‐ million, to go Into effect June 1. “We can't afford the usual lag of about one year between filing and approval,” he said. The commission has until May 1 to consider the request. Then it will set public hear ings. To expedite them, the utility filed its whole case with the application. If approved, the temporary increase would affect all direct customers at once. Tenants whose gas and electric costs are included in the rent would not be billed for the increase, city officials said. But land lords would be expected to ap ply for a rent increase. A report to Governor Rocke feller from the commission's chairman, Joseph C. Swidler, disclosed that the utility was studying a proposal that gas turbine power and steam gen erators be combined in a single system.

136-> Englewood Pupils' Poems Are Made Into a Record
ENGLEWOOD, N.J., May 1— Pupils in the eighth grade of Dwight School and the Engle wood School for Boys, which are on adjoining campuses here, will make their debuts next week as recording artists. The pupils have macle a long‐play ing record, “Promises to Be Kept,” which will be released next week by Spoken Arts, Inc., of New Rochelle, N.Y. The record is made up of poems composed and recited by the pupils of Susan Sherman, an author of two novels who teaches English at Dwight. The recording represents more than 75 original poems read by 40 pupils. Started as a morale project when the class was shifted to a less attractive room than one used formerly, the recording program was conceived by Miss Sherman when she was struck by the beauty of the poems the children had written for Christmas. Proceeds from the sale will go to the Dwight School's stu dent fund

137-> CARACAS REFORMS ITS BUS SERVICES
CARACAS, Venezuela, May 1 —The Caracas City Council has voted unanimously to abolish the municipally owned bus system and create a mass trans part corporation jointly with private capital to operate a new one. According to city officials, the unusual action is fraught with political complications here and runs contrary to transport trends elsewhere in Latin America. The council president, Rafael Dominguez Sisco, conceded the other day that the public would oppose any fare increases, but said that the rapid deterioration of the present system had also causing rising discontent. “We have no choice,” Mr. Dominguez said. Past adminis trations have considered the bus system as a purely public service, he went on. “But today we have buses running on only 25 of 46 routes.” “On one route, the busy Manicomio‐Silencio line, there is only one bus in operation, he said. “And the city loses more than $3‐million a year to keep less than 200 units oper ating.” Mr. Dominguez said that he expected trouble from transport workers unions and “certain political groups” when the new company began operating in a few months with an initial fleet of 200 buses. A council aide added that the bus system had deteriorated because “city employes have come to believe that as long as taxpayers tolerate deficits and their jobs are secure they are retired the day they are hired.” This is not so, spokesmen for the transport workers told newsmen afterward. “Our men work just as hard as those employed by private bus lines,” one union statement said. “The problem is that those who run the city do not ride buses and don't give a damn about the poor people who have to wait an hour or more for a bus.” “What have they done about the traffic mess, which dis courages riders? Our shopmen work miracles to keep the decrepit buses running and have to do without materials and tools,” the statement said. Most Caracas residents inter viewed agreed with both views but placed the blame on other factors as well. They said Cara cas had tripled in population in the last dozen years. This capital now has 2.5 million people, a quarter of the Vene zuelan population. Caracas is believed to be the most motorized city in Latin America. Two‐thirds of the country's 960,000 vehicles crowd its streets. The city has no center. Caracas residents describe the city as a collection of communities connected by choked freeways that end in narrow alleys. The traffic problem is ex pected to worsen when work begins on the city's first sub way in November. As it is, a bus ride that is scheduled to take about 20 minutes actually takes never less than one hour, and usually longer, several drivers said. To add to the confusion, some 5,000 privately owned vehicles ply the streets, carry ing up to five passengers. They charge the equivalent of 11 to 25 cents—or twice the bus fares—and pick up and dis charge passengers anywhere the passengers indicate. Many white‐collar workers expect the privately owned vehicles, which they favor over buses, to raise fares when those for the new bus system go up. Rates of ordinary taxis often depend on traffic conditions, the time of day and the dis tance traveled. The minimum fare is the equivalent of $1.10 —there are no metered cabs in Caracas. The regular taxis are fre quently hired from auto‐rental companies or from individual owners for about $10 a day or for a 12‐hour period. The driver pays for the fuel and keeps the fares. One trip to the airport here pays for the day's rental. The Ministry of Communica tions and Transport recently proposed the elimination of police patrol cars after a study found that it often had taken two hours for calls to be an swered. It was proposed that police men use motorcycles and fol low the example of many motorists who use the side walks to bypass traffic jams.

139-> The Joe Alsop Story
WASHINGTON. MRS. ALICE ROOSEVELT LONG WORTH, the most deadly 87‐year‐old lady in the world, fretted all afternoon one day to come up with a “nice” story to tell me about Joseph Alsop, her dear cousin, who is the syndicated Washington political columnist. The best she could do was one about Joe and his two brothers, Stewart, the Newsweek columnist, and John, who lives near the Alsop family farm in Avon, Conn., and ran for Governor unsuccessfully a few years ago. Until Joe grumpily quit the act in the early nineteen‐sixties, the Alsop boys used to play a melo dramatic scene set in the snowy wastes of Siberia. John and Stewart were the desperate muzhiks who flung the children to the hungry wolves. Joe was cast as Grishkin, the faithful but ill‐fated old Russian horse. To Cousin Alice, Joe was al ways most endearingly abashed and humorless down there on his hands and knees. With the Russian horse story, rather well‐known “Joe story” as it turned out, Mrs. Longworth felt she had properly discharged the promise Joe had extracted from her to be kind. The rest of her conversation was as forthright as a sharp stick in the eye, and largely unprintable. * * * FEW days later I received a tele phone call at home. “Baah‐ney?” inquired the voice of Joe Alsop. Joe Alsop has affected a Sir Cedric Hardwicke accent since he was a little boy. “I am having about 15 young peo ple over for drinks and discussion tomorrow night,” Joe said. “They're from Yale, the Political Union, and they're in town for seminars. I won der if you and Maggi would like to come over and see how Old Joe gets on with young people?” We arrived at Joe's house in Georgetown about half an hour late and expected to see a crowd. But Joe was in his living room poised on the edge of his Louis XV chair with an outsized glass of Scotch and water cupped in his hands. Across from him sat one ill‐at‐ease young man. When it was only we—not the ex pected crew of Yale students—who entered the room, Joe's eyes blinked behind his round, owly glasses and his shoulders drooped. He rose heav ily to greet us. “I am told by this young man,” Joe said lightly, “that the students may have chosen this time to eat their dinner since they have not yet been fed. Therefore, we may not see them tonight.” The young man from Yale was try ing hard to think of excuses without any luck. We made small talk for a while. Poor Joe, one of the most renowned and attentive hosts in Washington, swirled his Scotch and cocked his head at every street sound. After a time, it grew evident that Joe had given a party to which nobody, or worse than that, only one lone young man, had chosen to come. “I'm terribly sorry, Barney,” Joe said bleakly when all hope was lost. “I suppose I could have attracted them with something to eat had I known they would not be fed.” Now if you have seen or heard enough of Joe Alsop's stately side, his imperious side, his pompous, ar rogant, biting, intellectual, practical, maudlin, sentimental, amusing, bitchy and mock‐humble sides, you cannot help but be refreshed to catch a glimpse of any honest emotion es caping from Joe Alsop—even if it happens to be honest suffering. If you like Joe you will enjoy his suffering because you find it endear ing, as Mrs. Longworth does. If you are among those who find him intol enable, you will enjoy his suffering because you like to see him squirm. That helps explain why Joe's friends and enemies both delight in telling essentially the same “Joe stories.” Their motives may differ, but the results are the same. Anyway, before the “Joe story” about the‐party‐nobody‐came‐to goes the rounds, let me add what some people will think is a happy ending. The Yale students all arrived in a dither about five minutes later, ex plaining that a Washington cop had stopped and delayed them for a blind headlight or something. Joe instantly re‐inflated himself and filled the house like one of those yellow rubber life rafts when you yank the cord on the gas cartridge. He led his guests into the candle lighted dining room, took his place at the head of the table and artfully let them know during the first hour of monologue some of the things he feels are basic field orientation about himself. is related to both the Teddy and the Franklin branches of the Roosevelt family tree; Jack Kennedy was at home in Joe's living room, and after the Inaugural Balls he dropped Jacqueline off at the White House and finished celebrating in Joe's house; he has 26 godchildren (more or less), two stepchildren and a wife “acquired” when he was 50; he is, naturally, Harvard; he has written a Washington column for almost 35 years, minus a hitch in the service in World War II as an aide to Gen. Claire Chennault of the Flying Tigers; he reads and speaks French, and he taught himself to read Chi nese during eight months in a Japanese internment camp; he is a dedicated amateur archeologist; he considers himself first and foremost a reporter—“of facts.” The Yale students stayed for nearly three hours and then left only reluctantly. They all knew from reputa tion or reading his columns how bellicose a hawk Joe is. So they listened politely to his pronunciamentos on Viet nam, gave brief rebuttal and passed on to more engaging subjects, like the scandalous state of American education, the meaning of success in American life (“Money,” Joe said flatly and approvingly), and even the drug culture. “I'm for legalizing mari juana,” Joe said. “I smoked opium myself in China. Gave me a terrible hangover.” Toward the close of the dis cussion, Joe was nudged away from the profound Alsopy Po litical Thought stuff and into things like his garden, the books in his immense personal library, Greek historians, tales of the Alsop ancestor ladies whose small, seawater‐cold eyes looked down on the gathering from their wall por traits, and Joe's father, who when he got furious with Jce, as he often did, would bellow, “Jesus Christ in the foothills!” and berate his fashionably lib eral son for his goddamned unrealistic ideas. The young people were eager to know that kind of thing about Joseph Alsop and the evening was thus a huge success. * * * McGEORGE BUNDY, the president of the Ford Foundation and a longtime friend of Joe's, remarked: “Washington absolutely chews itself up over whatever is going on at the moment.” What was going on in Joe Alsop's sphere at the moment was the column. The column, published in early February, was headlined “Courage of a President.” In it Joe had praised President Nixon for his “lonely” de cision on Laos. Joe has never been anything but relentlessly hawkish about Vietnam; his position that the United States must either “win” or admit defeat and creep away into Second‐Rate Powerhood has never wobbled a bit over the long years during which others have about‐faced. Con sistency for Joseph Wright Alsop is not the refuge of simple minds, but of strong ones. What Joe did in the column was juxtapose his notion that President Nixon demonstrated “cool courage” in taking the Laos “risk” and the angry reaction to the Laos adven ture by Senator J. W. Ful bright and his colleagues who, Joe wrote, “are downright eager to be proved right by an American defeat in war, and will loathe being proved wrong by U.S. success in Southeast Asia.” When the White House press office copied and dis tributed the column in ques tion (without Alsop's “writ ten” permission) and thereby gave Presidential sanction to the accusation against Ful bright & Co., the roar of dis pleasure rumbled through most of the Washington press corps and around town for weeks. The Fulbright slur moved at least four of Alsop's fellow columnists to forsake their usual aloofness from one another and attack him in their own space. Jandes Res ton of The Times called Al sop's accusation “unspeak able,” which is a resounding denunciation in Scotty Res ton's written vocabulary. Several people eagerly pointed ‘out that President Nixon had called Alsop at home one afternoon to give him advance knowledge of the Laos ‘invasion. Within hours, the content of ‘that private Nixon‐Alsop telephone conver sation was all over town, and within days it was in the press. How the tale of the telephone call leaked out tells you something about the cal culation that goes on in Washington's clubby world of Power Politics and Power Press. It happens, Joe says, that the wife of Tom Braden, an other Washington columnist, was sitting in Joe's living room when the Alsop maid entered, saying something like: “Mr. Alsop, the President is on the telephone.” President Nixon had called, Joe ex plains, to extend a personal invitation to Joe to attend an 87th birthday party for Mrs. Longworth at the White House. “At the tail end of our little conversation he told me that Laos was going to happen. It was just a few hours in ad vance. Certainly it was no ‘scoop’ or anything. What was I going to do with the infor mation? I don't work for wire service. “But I made the mistake,” Joe went on, “of telling Tom's wife. Of course I pledged her to utter secrecy, and of course she couldn't wait to get out of the house to tell, and it was out”—precisely as Joe Alsop knew it would be. “There are no secrets in your little Georgetown group, are there, Joe?” I asked. “They know everything down to the ‘number of fillings ‘in man's teeth.” “Yes, Baah‐ney,” he said, “the gossip is simply awful. I remember when everyone discussed [former Secretary of Defense] Clark Clifford's piles, with Clark Clifford in the lead.” The angry buzzing after the telephone story was out painted Alsop as just short of an Administration flack being paid off with inside tips from a grateful President whose vanity Joe loved to massage. Even some of Joe's closest friends were a little squeam ish about the whole episode, but they cautioned that any Administration or politician who thinks Joe Alsop is in his pocket is making an impetuous and shallow blunder. Their most recent case in point re calls the cordial relationship that existed between Joe and Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird—until Joe dug up evi dence (from his gold mine of Pentagon sources) that Laird was trying to slip us gently out of Vietnam while still talk ing like a hawk. The inevita ble column was headlined: “Laird—Grand Saboteur.” * * * PART of Joe Alsop's daily stock in trade is awe and fear. People are awed by Joe's retentive mind and his eru dition. He enjoys letting you know that he has read all of those classics you neglected and many you never heard of. Joe will somehow find a rea son to quote Herodotus or an 11th‐century Chinese poet philosopher at you, and the recitation is often punctuated with learned catarrhal noises and a self‐satisfied chuckle that excludes you entirely from his arcane little joke. If that kind of uneasy preten tiousness bothers you, you'll soon be driven up the wall. If you can filter out the man nerisms, with a double Scotch perhaps the content of his mind is rich and often gen uinely keen and funny. People are afraid of Joe's friends. Even Joe's friends are afraid of Joe's friends. Joe Alsop has “acquired” his friends with a Yankee shrewdness for good business and long‐term investment. His blue chips, of course, are his family associations with the propertied WASP Establish ment. Then, back in the early days of the New Deal, when young men of great potential for future power and in fluence were a dime a dozen in Washington, Joe collected avidly and well. Later, he speculated brilliantly on such as Jack Kennedy, who was certainly a sleeper back when Joe first spotted his possibili ties for growth. Now, as ever, he is scrupulous about select ing “younger friends” who will mature in a decade or so, like tax‐free municipals. “That's the way Joe plays the Game,” remarks Mrs. Longworth, who vastly ad mires anyone who plays the political game well. “I know that whenever I go over to Joe's house for a dinner party I am working for him. I don't mind a bit. Not a bit. I know Joe uses me. Good heavens, he uses everybody.” MRS. KATHARINE GRA HAM, the publisher of The Washington Post and News week, who is a fast friend of Joe's and knows how to play the Game as well as or better than he does, asked him one night after a lot of partying, “What do you do with your old, boring friends?” “That's simple, dah‐ling,” Joe “I send them to the thrift shop.” A lot of people, whose ca reers or life style dictate that they circulate in Washington, nervously know what that means. “I know I' well off” a Washington columnist with a reputetion for utter fearless ness said. “I'm not going to get involved with Joe.” “You'd better be careful what you say about Alsop,” came the friendly warning from Nicholas von Hoffman, the bad‐boy Washington Post columnist. “That is, if you ever intend to get around with the Georgetown bunch. I don't envy you.” “I want to be very careful,” Prof. Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, said. He has had some titanic rows with Joe, usually in front of lots of peo ple. “We have resumed,” he added, “a precerious friend ship.“ * * * “MAKE what I told you come out funny, Bar ney,” said Art Buchwald, the Washington humor columnist. “Say that I said Joe Alsop has the biggest collection of cap tured North Vietnamese docu ments in America.” I have said it, but the Alsop Buchwald feud is sometimes less than funny, although it has its moments, like hippo potamuses making love. Art wrote a play called “Sheep on the Runway” that got to Broadway last year. In it was a character named Joe Mayflower, a syndicated Washington political colum nist who might bear a resem blance to Joe Alsop. In the play, Joe Mayflower barges into the American Em bassy in a remote and lazy kingdom called Nonomura and instantly sniffs out a Com munist threat to America's security requiring armed U.S. intervention. Joe (Mayflower) throws his bullying weight around, invokes his mighty friends in Washington, sum mons cowed Army generals to the scene, and soon gets him self a lovely war going. It is a conflict, one is left to as sume, which only the most pusillanimous foreign ‐ policy of — unless, of course, they wanted to see the United States defeated in a war just to prove Joe (Mayflower) wrong. The feud is said to have erupted after some of Joe's and Art's friends persisted in needling Joe about the May flower character. Joe's in creasingly violent reaction both d;smayed and delighted the Washington gossips. First, Joe threatened to sue Buch wald for libel or something. He was advised that suit would fail and simply produce added publicity for a play that was destined to flop if out‐of‐ town reviews meant anything (It actually ran 100 or so per formances, and lostmoney for the backers. Art says he made money.) Joe then applied pressure to his friends to get Art to delete or change the character. Joe said he was afraid the May flower character was going to make him a laughingstock, in the same way (as Joe tells it) the character of Sheridan Whiteside in “The Man Who Came to Dinner” made a laughingstock out of his dear, departed old friend Alexander Woollcott, the razor‐tongued drama critic and radio “Town Crier” of the nineteen‐twen ties and thirties. When that ploy failed, Joe spread the word that Art Buchwald was a foul excre ment and that anyone who went to see the play could never darken the Alsop door again. The ultimatum caused near panic in the streets of George town. The problem was that most of Joe's friends are also Art's friends, and also friends of one another. Robert Kint ner, the retired president of the National Broadcasting There are those among Joe's friends who went to the play, and those who didn't. The ones who didn't say things like, “Well … I just didn't.” There were those, too, who wanted to go but simply couldn't. Like the wife of the Israeli Ambassador, who stayed home for reasons that might have been discussed at a Cabinet meeting in Tel Aviv. It is a fact of Israeli diplomacy that Joseph Alsop expresses articulate positions in his columns, and to his friends in high places, that often faith fully reflect Israeli informa tion and designs in the Middle Company and one of Joe's oldest friends—they started writing a column together back in 1937—pleaded with him: “For God's sake, Joe, don't start up with Buchwald. He's the only man in Wash ington whcl doesn't have any enemies.” But word of the feud was already out in the newspapers —precisely as Joe Alsop knew it would be —and Joe would not relent. East. And who is Ant Buch wald but a funny Jewish columnist? Art easily survived the at tempted shunning, of course. But a lot of Joe's friends will tell you that they are glad it was Buchwald who was sent to Joe's thrift shop and not a lesser man. “You know what it is about Joe,” mused Polly Wisner. She is the widow of Frank Wisner, the former head of the depart ment of dirty tricks for the Central Intelligence Agency. Mrs. Wisner is a “dear, close” friend of Joe's who, along with Kay Graham, goes to Baden‐Baden and Hot Springs with Joe on his annual rest cure. Polly also went to Art's play. “What it is is that Joe really intimidates people. He likes that. You always feel that Joe Alsop has the drop on you.” * * * JOE ALSOP owns the face of a bilious basset hound with a high forehead. His eyes, like the eyes of those 18th‐century burgher ladies on his dining‐room wall, are the color of Long Island Sound on a stormy morning, and just as hard to see into. The lines at the corners of his mouth slant naturally down from a thin upper lip; two deep lines run from the flares of his patrician nose and down under his cheek bones. A lot of little character lines sag under his eyes. He has contrived the habit of holding his face in both hands when he talks to you as if he had two awful tooth aches. When he wants to register Alsopian displeasure, he has learned to press the heels of his hands together just above his chin; then every one of those lines is drawn even steeper and the look is one of excruciating despair. To register Alsopian approval, he presses up on his cheek bones and the mouth lines go up like the happy face on a stick man. People will try to ascribe most of what they tell you is wrong with Joe Alsop, includ ing his position on Vietnam, in some way or other to … glands. He was once very fat. Mrs. Longworth recalls the first time she met Joe in Washing ton, about 48 years ago: “He was a fat, sullen, sour little boy.” But Joe's grandmother, Corinne Roosevelt Robinson, predicted ‘that “one day you and this child will become good friends.” As in the Vic torian novels, it came to pass. Kay Graham remembers meet ing Joe at a dance once when she was a young girl. “You could never have told me we'd ever be friends,” she says. “He was repulsive.” At age 27, just before Joe and Bob Kintner started out writing the column, Joe checked into Johns Hopkins hospital for a three‐month crash diet cure. “I was suffer ing fibrillation of the heart,” Joe says. “The doctor told me I had to get the fat off or die.” Joe lost about 80 pounds, down from 245 to 165 on a 5‐foot 10‐inch frame. He car ries a paunch now and must fight an endless war to keep from ballooning up over 200 pounds again. What effect it had on Joe to be a corpulent freak in those formative years of childhood and young manhood is a mat ter of plentiful speculation. Joe recalls leaving Johns Hop kins with his shrunken and suddenly unremarkable new physique: “I felt that I still had to be the jolly fat man,” he says. “But the same jokes you told when you were a jolly fat man are not funny any more. You are not so conspicuous. You have to do something else to be conspicuous. It is a very different world.” * * * ALL the Alsop boys went to Groton School, which was founded in 1884 by the Rev. Dr. Endicott Peabody. Into Dr. Peabody's arche typal Eastern Establishment, Episcopalian, sternly self‐dis ciplined hands were delivered the boys of the most privi leged, not necessarily rich, American Families, whose male issue were groomed to run the nation (and whose daughters were prepared to inherit it). Boys like Dean Acheson, Newbold Morris, Sumner Welles, Averell Har riman, Roosevelts by the dozens, Cushings, Motleys, LaFarges, Whitneys and so on. “My second and third forms were probably the worst time in my life,” he says. “I was disgustingly fat. On top of that, Pa dressed me in Con necticut homespun — he was very ‘patriotic’ about Con necticut and he insisted on it — and homespun was this gray, drab material exactly like the chauffeurs' uniforms. “I didn't have any friends at all, not a single one—ex cept, I guess, Dick Bissell, who was from my neighborhood.” (Richard Bissell, as a ranking official of the C.I.A., was to take much of the rap for the Bay of Pigs fiasco.) Long before he arrived at Groton, Joe had learned to live comfortably secure in the world of books. So he read incessantly. “Then I decided that it Stewart Alsop, who was 57 years old not long ago, is three years his brother Joe's junior. He is a big, likable man and a prolific political writer. The num ber of long articles he wrote for the old Saturday Evening Post alone is astonishing. Stewart was rejected by the United States Army before we entered World War II and he joined the British Army. He was a machine‐gun pla toon commander in Italy. Later, he parachuted be hind the lines in France for the O.S.S. He spent some good times and bad, ending up in Cognac en joying the Napoleon brandy. He learned “how remarkably effective and easy guerrilla warfare is.” Joe was seeking a col umn partner after Bob Kintner left for broadcast ing and shortly after the war was over he seized upon Stewart, who found the typewriter easy to op erate. Their stormy part nership lasted 12 years, and Stewart says the “di vorce” was amicable. Stewart has six children, ranging in age from 26 down to 3, and lives in Cleveland Park, the leafy section of Washington to which Georgetowners move when they begin to repro duce. Stewart feels that his and Joe's “mind sets” are very much the same, except that “from the start I was dubious about the Vietnam war, where Joe wasn't. But once we made the decision, I, too, felt we could not just sneak out.” On domestic issues: “Both Joe and I are very square ‘New Deal’ liberals, although I have much more interest in the New Left than Joe does.” Joe and Stewart and their families see each other a lot, and Joe, who relishes the role, acts the head of the family.—B. L. C. was far, far too lonely. It was a terrible bore. So, being a practical young man, I de cided to make friends. I had no leadership qualities at all, I can tell you, so no friends were going to just come to me. “I understood that I was hopelessly fat and not ath letic. So I made, roughly speaking, jokes. Jokes. That was the way I made friends of my chums. I was always very careful to keep my inter est in books and my ideas mostly away from other peo ple's lives. Things like books and ideas are a part of so few people's lives.” Joe shared the scholastic leadership of his class with two other boys and went on to Harvard, class of '32. He is certain that he was the only student in the college with a copy of James Joyce's “Ulys ses” (which was banned from the U.S. until 1933 as ob scene), or who for that mat ter had ever read Joyce. He was also the only student who had ever scored 100 per cent on Harvard's English en trance examination. “It was an essay test and I wrote an essay on five different ques tions because I read the in structions incorrectly. All you had to do was one.” Dr. Pea body, in what can only be described as an orgy of letting go, gave Groton a day's holi day in honor of Joe's accomp lishment. An Alsop family council consisting of Pa, Ma, Uncle Teddy Robinson, who had been an Under Secretary of the Navy in the Hoover Ad ministration, and Grandmoth er Robinson met in private deliberation upon Joe's grad uation to decide what the boy must do. “They rejected business be cause they thought I would go immediately bankrupt,” Joe says. “I might have gone back to Harvard for three years in law school, which was my vague intention, but then they thought I would probably have become one of the nu merous family drunks. So Ogden and Helen Reid, who were close young friends of my grandmother, were pre vailed upon to find me a place on their newspaper.” It is the prerogative of pub lishers to issue ukases like the order to employ Joe Alsop, and it is the reflex of editors, Like the legendary Stanley Walker, who was city editor of The New York Herald Tribune, to raise hell about it. “Stanley Walker was ex tremely horrified,” Joe recalls. “What was he going to do with this fat Harvard boy with a peculiar accent in his tough city room?” Richard Tobin, now the as sociate publisher of Saturday Review magazine, went to work for The Herald Trib on the same day, June 24, 1932, and sat next to Joe. “Joe didn't even know how to type,” Tobin recalls. “He was a strange figure in that city room. He had a huge belly and he wore a gold chain across it, over English‐tailored suits.” JOE swears that he never read a newspaper before he walked into the Trib offices “except to follow the reports on the Prohibition Amend ment, about which I was en tirely interested.” But Alsop had depth and talent, and Stanley Walker knew it after the first story or two. Within six months, Joe, whose style was fashionably fancy for the time, became one of The Trib's two or three top feature writers. His Fife in Manhattan was a forecast of what it is today in Washington. Joe lived in a large and comfortable flat on upper Madison Avenue which he shared with a college friend, Bill Patten. They em ployed a Japanese houseboy named Buto. (Joe was later best man at the wedding of William Samuel Patten, the Pattens of Lancaster, Mass., and Susan Mary Jay, a direct descendant of John Jay, the first Chief Justice. Bill Patten died of complications of asth ma in March, 1960, and in February of the next year Joe and Susan Mary were wed.) “Joe told me then that he had a stipend of $100 a month,” Dick Tobin recalls, “so he was well‐off, consider ing our salary at The Trib was $18 a week in the depths of the Depression and it wasn't long before we took a cut to $16. Joe always had booze in his apartment and of course it was always filled with poor reporters and strange people.” A vignette of the blubbery Joe sticks in Dick Tobin's mind: “We played craps in Joe's living room and I can see Joe with the dice. He sat cross legged on the floor with that big belly rolling out like one of those Japanese statues and he had a huge glass of Scotch next to him on the floor. Most people take the dice and throw them. It's a kind of ac cepted thing. Not Joe. Joe took his dice, held them in one hand up in front of his face and just dropped them— plop! — between his knees. Then he would look down on them with a quizzical expres sion. It was just another thing Joe insisted on doing his way.” took the young Joe Alsop un der his wing about that time. Like the Joe of today, the Aleck of yesterday was prone to loftily overstated judg ments of friends, enemies and circumstances. His young friend Joe was “exalted into lonely grandeur as 'the only young American I have ever met who is truly educated.’ “ The quotation comes from a book entitled “A. Woollcott, His Life and His World” by Samuel Hopkins Adams. I was told by one of Joe's columnist friends that it was a “key” to Joe's character, so I read it. Perhaps lit is. At any rate, anyone who reads the book and observes Joe Alsop must recognize that the older man had a profound effect on the mind and man ners of his protégé Woollcott was a master of the glittering insult and a skilled practition er of the defensive art of mock self‐effacement and mock humility. He was a grossly obese man, as Joe was, who had developed pretenses and idiosyncrasies Joe was eager to learn. He made revolting scenes at par ties, as Joe is accused of doing today; he was alternately vicious and fawning toward women, as Joe tends to be; his rages were volcanic but next morning his apologies could be abject, and it is much the same with Joe. There clearly was a method to the Woollcott madness, as there is to Joe Alsop's. That is that a calculated dose of eccentric behavior, call it “in dependent” if you like, serves to keep you from becoming “invisible,” as Joe puts in. In visibility was Aleck Wooll cott's abiding fear, too. “Aleck was a very, very cozy, warm, funny and gener ous friend,” Joe says, “and owe him a great, great deal.” * * * JOE was sent to Flemington, N.J., to cover the sensation al trial of Bruno Richard Haupt mann, the accused kidnapper and murderer of the Charles Lindbergh baby. With the at tention of the entire nation riveted on the proceedings, Joe did The Trib's features with notable flair and insight. His reputation was secured and not long after he was as signed to Washington, where his fifth cousin once removed was in the White House, to help make sense out of the New Deal. Within months, Joe had set up housekeeping in a little house not far from where he lives now. Grandmother Robin son's prophecy was fulfilled as Joe and Cousin Alice be came good friends. She gave him entree to the social set and fleets of interesting peo ple. Joe took proper care to cement friendships with ‘the promising newcomers still outside Alice's orbit. “It wasn't long,” Joe recalls, “be fore I knew everybody. Wash ington was a very small and provincial town, almost a vil lage, in 1935; in fact, until after the war. You could get a good grip on it then.” One of Joe's first assign‐ments in Washington was covering the so‐called Second Morgan Hearings, which were run by a stanchly isolationist Senator from North Dakota, Gerald P. Nye. The premise of the hearings was that the United States must not be come involved in a European war; that all wars are fostered by “the merchants of death” like the House of J. Pierpont Morgan, which was accused of trying to get America em broiled in a dirty overseas conflict to save Morgan in vestments in England. The up shot of the hearings was the Nye Neutrality Act prohibiting the United States from supply ing arms of any sort to any belligerents. “I supported the neutrality act on balance,” Joe says, “and much to my father's indignation. He kept shout ing, ‘Jesus Christ in the foot hills,’ and saying that within four years I'd be screaming for the act's repeal. He was wrong. I was screaming for repeal in three years. “That whole business had a was a period so much like now that it makes you sick to think about it.” Thus Joe made the switch tionism to pre‐World War II interventionism and he did it with the passion of a man who regrets having strayed from the God of his father and is determined to make amends. Now, when Joe gets started on Vietnam, you can hear the tone that must have been in his father's voice when he stormed about the Alsop manse in Avon bellow ing and slamming doors and calling down Jesus Christ in the foothills for the thou sandth time to help this thick son understand. In 1937, Alsop wrote a series of articles with Times reporter Turner Catledge about F. D. R.'s struggle to liberalize the Supreme Court. After the series appeared in The Saturday Evening Post, the North American News paper Alliance offered the two men a contract to team up as columnists. The Times did not want to let Catledge go and offered him a hefty raise and fine prospects. Cat ledge stayed on to become The Times's executive editor. Joe found a partner in Kint ner, a financial reporter for The Trib who knew the execu tive branch as intimately as Joe knew the Hill and the White House. * * * JOE was not then and never has been shy about pro moting his points of view both in and outside his col umns. “I always believed,” says Kintner, “that a reporter should report the facts and stay the hell out of the deci sion‐making process. But not Joe. Joe has always wanted to make things happen.” There is certainly nothing unusual about newsmen want ing to make things happen. Under the overcoat of so called objectivity and fairness, of strained reports that feebly try to balance lopsided situa tions, there is the naked urge in almost all newsmen to get things to happen their way. A lot of them succumb to the urge, of course, but few ad mit it even when caught in the act. Columnists are news men whose urge simply has gotten the better of them. “My boy,” McGeorge Bundy one day when Bundy was White House adviser for na tional security affairs. “My boy, I come not as a reporter but a friend. I come to tell you that you must save Mc Namara from himself.” Bundy was used to it. “Joe recognizes and enjoys the obvious fact that the news paper world is pent of the Washington power game,” Bundy says. “Joe is a partisan,” says Tom Johnston, whose close friendship with Joe started when Tom was Senator Rob ert Kennedy's New York of fice manager. “What Joe does is not balanced. Anybody who reads him must understand that.” When Joe and his brother Stewart were partners in the column for 12 years there were some terrible battles between them over Joe's out spoken views and Stewart's equally strong ones. Friends of theirs say that Stewart normally spoke for modera tion, Joe for ferocious attack. (Stewart was also the one who roared about the tele phone bills; Joe the one who would say, “Yes, Stew, yes,” and pick up the receiver to place a call to Hong Kong.) In the McCarthy years, they were among the first to speak out above the squeak of the liberal crowd. When Henry Wallace, a former Vice President of the United States, was summoned to testify before the Senate's Internal Security subcommit tee, Washington lawyers in great flocks found reasons not to represent him. “Joe and I spent hours and hours trying to get someone who would defend Wallace,” Arthur Schlesinger recalls. “We finally got George Ball to do it.” “We Accuse,” the brothers' book in defense of J. Robert Oppenheimer, was also alone at the time. Back a few years, when Joe turned interventionist in those ominous days before America got into World War II, he saw nothing whatever out of the way about working actively behind the scenes as a lobbyist for the British, who were desperately trying to persuade Roosevelt to let England have 50 or 60 First World War‐type destroyers. Joe was tipped off by John Foster, who was then of the British Embassy staff and is now a Member of Parliament, that Winston Churchill had “pleaded” with Roosevelt to send the warships, for other wise England was in grave danger of going under. Roose velt was said to have replied that antiwar sentiment in America completely prevented him from acting. With that carefully planted piece of top‐secret informa‐ tion, Joe went out to the Democratic National Conven tion, told key people what the real situation was with Eng land, and organized a lobby to get those warships. Later, Joe sent pro‐warship people to see F. D. R., was instru mental in getting Gen. John J. Pershing to make a radio broadcast backing the move, and persuaded Benjamin V. Cohen, a close Presidential adviser, to write a favorable opinion on the matter. “I was but the weight of a feather in the balance,” Joe says humbly now. Churchill is said to have credited the arrival of those destroyers, as much as any thing, with keeping Britain afloat. When war at last looked inevitable, Joe gave up the column and volunteered for the service. The Army re jected him for something to do with blood pressure, but the Navy accepted him on a waiver. He was assigned as a naval observer in Bombay. That, Joe says, was much too far out of the action for him and he pulled strings with high‐level friends in the War Department and was allowed to resign from the Navy to join up with the. American Volunteer Group, the “Flying Tigers,” training in Burma. 'Stilwell and the American Experience in China 1941‐45,” the best‐selling book by Bar bara Tuchman, the historian, contains some searing refer ences to Joe Alsop, who is described as a fanatic “public relations aide” for General Chennault, who had aligned himself with the fortunes of Generalissimo Chiang Kai shek. General Stilwell hated the Generalissimo, whose re gime he felt was rotten with corruption and could not fight. He also despised “nauseating” Americans who pretended British accents. And he felt about Roosevelt the way most Republicans did. Old “Vinegar Joe” did not waste much of his affection on Alsop or his boss, and Mrs. Tuchman doesn't either. In the book, Joe is depicted as a wily character assassin who cost Stilwell no end of anguish and finally his com mand in China before he died. Then, with Chennault, Joe is said to have defamed Stilwell after death by trying to paint him as soft on the Chinese Communists, whose troops, Stilwell felt, fought far better than Chiang's. The tangled tale in Mrs. Tuchman's book is best told by her; his fierce rebuttal may be found in the book Joe says he's thinking about writing on the Alsop Experience in China, 1941‐45. * * * MEMORY usually betrays the tellers of fish stories and war stories, so I shall leave out numerous Al sop escapades in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Most of the stories, from friends, enemies and Joe himself, re veal a man of considerable physical courage and derring do, who seeks out flying bul lets and trenches and the soldiers and officers who do battle. “I spent a lot of time with Joe in Vietnam,” says David Hoffman, who was a Washing ton Post correspondent out there for several years. He recalls watching Joe operate last year on one of the twice yearly trips to Indochina that Joe has made for the past seven years. “He worked his damned tail off,” Hoffman says. “At the end of the day he was gray and exhausted, but I was 35 years old and he was 60 and I was almost in a state of collapse. Then he would spend the night getting drunk as a dog with some officers or diplomats, and the next day he'd be out in the field work ing again. He's a journalist in the tradition of Saint‐Exupéry or André Mairaux, and I have great admiration for him. “The damned hook is that for all his work and sweat he might just as well be back home in Georgetown because he sees only what he wants to see out there — just like the dove reporters who see only the things they want to see. The difference is that Joe usually writes what he wants to see with more style.” Hoffman's is a minority re port. Many other reporters who have watched Joe operate in the war zone detest him. They resent that he is heli coptered about w:th the effec tive rank of a brigadier gener al. They loathe his swagger ing attitude toward the brass, who are under orders from the Pentagon to polish him. Still, there is often a perverse kind of admiration expressed about him, this strange ghost of a 19th‐century man report ing, in his Kiplingesque way, this uniquely 20th‐century war. * * * MUCH is made of how ludicrously often Joe has abandoned his innate pes semism about everything and predicted an end to the Viet nam war by such and such a date. “Well, you keep learning in this business; I've learned not to deal in time frames,” Joe says. “And I also overesti mated the capacity of our own country, which is an error in itself.” Joe asserts that he no longer minds criticism about his dreadfully wrong predic tions. “The only thing I ever really get mad about now is being constantly accused of inaccuracy. Take the Tet of fensive. I said it was a mili tary ‘disaster’ for the other side. I was accused of gross inaccuracy at the time. Then, six months or so later, a Times reporter looked over the Tet results and said in a front page story that Tet was a po litical and military disaster for the other side.” * * * JOE ALSOP says he is not misled by some notions of progress. It decidedly does not follow, in his view, that the latest model is necessarily an improvement over the first, and that goes for cul tures and nations and civiliza tions as well as things. “I don't really know what human progress is,” Joe says. “It is perhaps people's degree of freedom, their relative com fort, simple things like that. We are supposed to have progress, but I cannot observe that people are as happy or content as they were when I was young. This country was very much happier and at ease in its own skin then.” Now we are in a God‐awful mess on so many counts: SURVIVAL: “Survival is the most urgent problem facing the nation, of course. Our survival is by no means as sured; it is not God‐given by any means.” MIDDLE EAST: “IT is a fright ful situation in the Middle East. The Israelis say the danger is less now. That may be, unless we commit some damned folly in the short run. I am convinced that if the danger is less, it is because President Nixon showed great toughness in the Far East and Jordan crises. But if we neglect the overseas balance it will be awful.” GHETTO “If one had very much sense he would see that what ghetto schools need is a very radical, expensive, school‐improve ment program. I was for this long ago. Then, too, you have the problem of children locked up by their mothers in their houses, eating lead off the walls for hours and hours and hours and hours. And then what you get in the prekin deegartens are lumps — just lumps.” CHILDREN: “I think parents nowadays are afraid of their children. I never had any chil dren of my own so I don't know precisely how that hap pens. It is a different thing being a stepfather. Your ego is not so engaged.” DISSENT: “I am very philo sophical about it. Everybody forgets we had dissent in the Korean war but it was less effective because it was right wing dissent. … It reminds me now a very great deal of the British in the nineteen thirties. The dissent is based on a very wishful estimate of the world we live in.” Joe's big glass of Scotch is down to the ice cubes and the incandescent gloom closes in completely. “You used to be able to be enthusiastic about remedies,” he says in soliloquy. “We enacted all the supposed remedies for all the great domestic problems, ex cept pollution, which wasn't recognized as a problem, and they haven't worked. And probably some have worked in reverse. Now it gets very hard to fight. … “For God's sake, give me something I can be enthusias tic about.” * * * “MAYBE it ‘is silly (al though I am not sure about this in the age of the H‐bomb) but I am one of those who is much moved by history. I am stirred by the triumphs, depressed by the defeats, and made melancholy, above all, by the terrible transitoriness of human ac complishment which is, I fear, history's most obvious les son.” Joe Alsop wrote that pas sage in a book called “From the Silent Earth, A Report on the Greek Bronze Age.” It is small wonder that those who know Joe well almost all men tion his melancholy streak. Nothing, not even human ac complishment, is as transitory as a political newspaper column. If you read back over years and years of Joe Alsop's columns and reportorial books you will soon forget almost every one. You will be left with an impression of careful construction, lucid writing, a sure and clever control of the English language. But except for a column he does once each year about the joy and pain his Georgetown garden gives him, you will not carry away an ember of warmth. On the other hand, in a handful of articles for The New Yorker magazine, and in the “Silent Earth” book, Joe displays a magical gift for raising the dead from the dust and breathing life into their shades. He uses his vast knowledge of the political game, which probably has never changed in its essen tials, to give real motives to the movements of the Myce naeans and the Minoans. He talks about them as if they peopled the White House and the Capitol, planned their raids and wars in the Penta gon and schemed and celeb rated in Georgetown. The an dent Greeks hold no power but the power to fascinate Joe; his judgments about them are therefore far more kind and deep and memorable than most of his contemporary opinions. He is now hard at work on a huge book about “taste”— in the sense of discernment, quality, esthetic preference. read 10 completed chapters. With some editing to delete his pedantic repetitions and his mock humilities about being an amateur in the field (as if there were any “profes sionals” of taste), it is a vivid and completely engrossing tame‐machine trip that traces beautiful and important ob jects of art from warm hand to warm hand up through the centuries and attempts to ex plain why people behold beauty so differently from one time to the next. These two books are clear ly the product of Joseph Al sop's carefully guarded other side. The side that thinks “the 95 per cent of my thoughts which I share with no one.” The side that Joe learned to hide back at Groton while he made, roughly, jokes, to plead for friendship and at tention to that lonely little kid buried under all the flabby flesh. Perhaps, in the seventh dec ade of his life, Joe Alsop will grow less afraid of dis appearing and will produce something more that will en dure after the surviving friends and politicians he has so diligently cultivated say their “Washington‐won't‐be the‐same‐without‐Joes” and resume the Game where they left off. ▀

143-> President's War Powers Face State and Federal Legal Tests
HARTFORD, May 1—In at least 10 state capitals as well as in Washington, lawmakers have begun to question the ex tent of the President's author ity in undeclared wars such as Vietnam. State legislators from Con necticut and New York to Cali fornia have introduced bills de signed to force the Supreme Court to clarify who is empow ered to commit American troops to battle and under what circumstances. At the same time, a few Congressmen in Washington have presented legislation that sharply defines and limits the use of military might by the President. Support for the bills has been somewhat limited in the traditionally conservative state houses, but significant interest has been noted in the Senate. No clear picture of the extent of interest in the legislation has yet emerged in the House of Representatives. Under a bill written by Sen ator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York which is perhaps the most comprehensive of those now being studied by Congressional committees, the President could—as is now the case—independently order the military into action to repel a sudden attack, to protect American lives abroad and to comply with such national com mitments as those agreed to by treaty. More important Mr. Javits would require the President to report promptly to Congress any use of the military and prohibit him from sustaining military action for more than 30 days without legislative ap proval. Mr. Javits and some of his colleagues feel that over the years, as the World Wars have become a part of memory and limited wars — such as in Korea, the Middle East and the Dominican Republic—have be come more common, the bal ance in foreign policy has tipped in favor of the President. What he hopes to do in his legislation, Mr. Javits said, is “restore the traditional balance between the President and the Congress as envisioned in the checks and balances between the executive and legislative branches in the Constitution.” In what appeared to be another expression of concern over the imbalance, the Sen ate Armed Service Committee approved legislation on Wed nesday that would limit the President's power to draft troops. The legislation set ceiling on conscription that the President could exceed only by issuing an executive order set ting out urgent national secur ity reasons. The state legislation that has been introduced across the country has been patterned after a bill signed into law in Massachusetts last spring. It challenges the constitutionality of the United States's involve ment in Vietnam. The authors of the legislation argue that Presidents Johnson, and Nixon overstepped the, bounds of their constitutionally ascribed authority by sending American troops into sustained combat in Vietnam in the ab sence of a formal declaration of war by Congress. For that reason, they insist, young Americans cannot be legally ordered to combat in Vietnam. The bills stipulate that no state resident shall be forced into combat overseas unless Congress has declared that state of war exists. Some of the bills permit the President the independent use of troops for brief emergencies, such as delineated by Mr. Javits. In nearly every case, the bills di rect state attorneys general to defend young men who refuse orders to proceed to the “com bat zone.” “In the entire history of American constitutional law, the courts have never once ei ther explicitly or by inference affirmed the Presidential usur pation of that part of the com plex of foreign policy powers which commit the nation to war,” said Steven Worth, an associate professor of political science at Northeastern Uni versity in Boston, who helped write the Massachusetts bill. “We are seeking through this legislation,” he went on, “one constitutional avenue under which the Supreme Court must make that decision. Last fall, Robert Quinn, the Attorney General of Massachu setts, attempted to take a case on the war issue directly to the Supreme Court. But the Justices ruled that the matter had to be heard first in the lower Federal courts, where it is now pending. According to Mr. Worth, the present strategy is to try to get several states to take cases to Federal courts with hopes that they would eventually be joined as one and heard by the Supreme Court. In Connecticut and New York and most of the other states, the legislation is given little chance of becoming law. But Gov. Wendell R. Ander son of Minnesota signed a war challenge bill in mid‐April after it had overwhelmingly passed the Legislature. And Gov. Pat rick J. Lucey of Wisconsin has expressed enthusiastic support for a similar bill that is ex pected to reach his desk some time this month. Last September, the New York City Council passed a res olution directing J. Lee Rankin, the city's Corporation Counsel, to institute court action on the request of any soldier from the city who had been ordered to Vietnam and objected on con stitutional grounds. So far, no case has gone to court, but a soolcesman said this week that the Corporation Counsel's office was “in the process of formulating a com plaint and will be filing suit in the very near future.” While antiwar bills either died in committee or were ex pected to in New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia and Oregon, with little evi dence of public concern, they appear to have stimulated fur ther discussion on the war in Maryland, California and Con necticut.

145-> Rex Stout, 85, Gives Clues on Good Writing
DANBURY, Conn., Nov. 30 —Orchids tomorrow for Rex Stout. The creator of Nero Wolfe, that imperiously cunning and outsize fictional detective who solves the most intri cate crimes without stirring from his chair or endanger ing the pleasures of palate and intellect, is 85 tomorrow. Mr. Stout lives in a sprawling green house on a low country hill here, and birthday wishes are pouring in. The mailbox stands in New York State, but Mr. Stout was careful to build his house across the border in Connecticut. “It was 1930 and I didn't want Hamilton Fish as my representative,” he explained. “So what did I get? Clare Boothe Luce.” With throse three words of one syllable, the wispy bearded militant Quaker author who has fought many a public battle—against iso lationism, against a soft peace for Germany, In favor of world government—made displeasure plain. “One trouble with living beyond your deserved num ber of years is that there's always some reason to live another year,” he said. “And I'd like to live another year so that Nixon won't be President. If he's re‐elected I'll have to live another four years.” Mr. Stout began fussing with creation at the age of 4, when he read the Bible through, and at 15 he sold a 34‐line poem to the maga zine Smart Set. By 1933 he had written five novels and had learned two things: “I was a storyteller and I was not a great writer.” “It seemed apparent to me that writers of the first rank get themselves involved in the difficulties of the people they write about. It was ob vious in a paragraph the way Dostoyevsky felt about Ras kolnikov, or the way Tolstoy felt about Natasha, and their feeling was of a degree that I wouldn't get.” Mr. Stout spoke of char acters as made‐up or created. Made‐up characters are life like and adorn the page; cre ated characters live and haunt the memory. “In Thomas Mann's ‘Bud denbrooks’ there are four or five really created charac ters,” said Mr.. Stout, “and in ‘The Magic Mountain’ there isn't one. Tarzan was created and so was Scarlett O'Hara. It has nothing to do with the level of literature.” “Dickens couldn't introduce a character without going to the mirror and making faces,” he added. “That was a man who may have been interested in ideas, but peo ple was what he was excited about.” Mr. Stout went on: “I will not read the writing of a man like Malamud—a man interested in problems who pretends he's interested in people. Philip Roth's another who's interested in sociology instead of people, and it's too bad, because they're both pretty good at words. “Take Updike. He's such a good writer, he knows how to put words together. But he couldn't think up a new character to write about. He just got a new idea for problem. “You can always be fairly sure you don't want to read a story with a title that's pre tentious. That word ‘Redux’ [in ‘Rabbit Redux’] gives poor Updike away completely. If he wanted to use ‘Rabbit’ again, O.K., because that's the name of a person. But he had to get a word in it to fancy it up.” Mr. Stout has his own favorite. “When you're with E. B. White you're with the best American writer,” he said, “not in the sense that he's written great things, but he understands the fitness of words — and which go to gether. He never makes a mistake.” He has his own ranking also for mystery story writ ers: “Simenon has written some damn good ones, but he's also written some damn lousy ones. Ross Macdonald is a hell of a good story teller, but I wish he'd quit telling the same story over and over again. “I'd put Josephine Tey, an Englishwoman who died about 10 years ago, just after Dashiell Hammett, who was the best American de tective story writer not counting Poe, who started the whole thing. “In ‘The Glass Key’ Dash Hammett did the thing Hem ingway tried to do in every book he ever wrote, and a better job of it—establishing the essential manliness of a hero by telling a story about him, what he did and what he said and how he handled a situation.” Mr. Stout has written about 55 books, and he has no regrets about not having written more. “A lot of writers pretend they're des perate because they haven't accomplished more, but just don't believe them,” he said. “If you're able to use a pen you don't have to be sorry you can't write more —you just write more.” His last book, “Death of a Dude,” came out in 1969, and he is stuck midway through another book. Severe headaches have kept him from the type writer lately, and although physicians have found no physical explanation, he thinks it would be ridiculous at 85 to start psychoanalysis. Fortunately the headaches are disappearing, and he looks forward to the re newed pleasure of his trade. Writing books pleases him on two counts. “They have been popular enough so that I didn't have any difficulty for 40 years making a nice living from it,” he said. “That should be the funda mental concern of any healthy man.” The second satisfaction comes from readers’ letters: “My God you love to get them, and good Lord you hate to answer them.” Age has given him what he calls “a mealy self‐satis faction when you compare what you've done with what other people have done.” But he also considers himself a failure because of his “in ability to be concerned about things not close at hand.” He went on: “It's much easier for me to excuse my self for not being concerned about somebody else's prob lems because I have a right to be dead now anyway. “I haven't got any hatred for my fellow men, except about their handling of death. How pleasant it would be at 62 or 70 or 75—if a man with a healthy attitude to ward life and his own death could arrange a really pleas and end. “There seems to be some thing in the nature of the human animal that makes it difficult for him to bear the very word ‘death,’“ he said. “If you ask me, that's pretty dirty and it accounts for so much of the misery of life. ‘People's attitudes are so morbid that they consider suicide immoral. That's the unhealthiest and most con temptible attitude people can have, and I think we should be bitter about letting death make such jackasses of us. “I'm 85 now, and I could have such a pleasant time de ciding on the day and the ar rangements for my own quit ting, but the feeling of moral turpitude is so strong that my wife and daughters won't allow me to be happy. It an noys me that I'm not allowed to do a thing that would give me so much pleasure and so much satisfaction.”

146-> Women Seek a Bigger Role in Phase 2
WASHINGTON, Oct. 24—The National Women's Political Caucus criticized the Nixon Ad ministration today for naming only one woman, out of a total of 22 members, to the price and pay control agencies that will administer Phase Two of the economic stabilization pro gram. In a telegram to Secretary of the Treasury John B. Con nally, the caucus asked that the membership of the Price Com mission and Pay Board be ex panded so that more women could be included. The one woman named to the control agencies was Dr. Marina von Neumann Whitman, a professor of economics at the University of Pittsburgh, who was selected as a member of the Price Commission. Elizabeth Carpenter, spokes woman for the caucus, said that the group had decided to send its telegram to Mr. Con nally because “we aren't sure that President Nixon ever sees our messages to him.” She disclosed that the caucus had written Mr. Nixon Sept. 24, asking him to meet with a dele gation from the women's or ganization to discuss the ap pointment of a woman to the Supreme Court. But its letter and several follow‐up telephone calls were never acknowledged, Mrs. Carpenter said. The National Women's Politi cal Caucus is a grass ‐ roots political movement, which is in the process of organizing in each of the states. Its principal aim is the election and appoint ment of more women to public office. A 30‐member Policy Council, which directs the activities of the women's caucus, decided to protest Mr. Nixon's appoint ments at a meeting in Detroit yesterday. Mrs. Carpenter for mally announced the action to day. While there are more Demo crats than Republicans on the Policy Council, there are at least half a dozen Republican women, including Elly M. Peter son, former assistant chairman of the Republican National Committee. All of the Repub lican women who were present at the Detroit meeting partici pated in drafting the protest and all signed it, according to one of them, Bobbie Kilberg, a former White House Fellow un der the Nixon Administration. In addition to its telegram to Secretary Connally, the wom en's caucus also wired Presi dent Nixon, deploring “the empty lip‐service which ap pears to have marked the Ad ministration's attitude toward consideration of distinguished women for the Supreme Court vacancies.” The caucus has not yet de cided whether to oppose con firmation of the two men Mr. Nixon nominated to the Su preme Court, William H. Rehn quist and Lewis F. Powell Jr. It will “investigate before de ciding what to do,” the caucus informed Mr. Nixon. The caucus also sent a tele gram to Senator James O. East land, Democrat of Mississippi, who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will hold hearings on the nom inations, asking to be permitted to testify “so that our position can be fully stated and the availability of qualified women made fully known for vacancies on the Supreme Court and other Federal courts.” As for the appointments to the Phase Two stabilization agencies, the caucus informed Secretary Connally that it was “shocked that no women have been named to serve on the Pay Board and only one woman has been selected to sit on the Price Commission when, as you know, women represent almost half of the work force, the majority of the electorate and half of the brains in this country.”

148-> Reform Leaders Concerned Over the Lack of Awareness by American Jewish Youth of the Nazi Holocaust
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 7—Spiritual leaders of American Reform Judaism expressed concern today over the attitude of American Jewish youth who view the Nazi holocaust as “ancient history” without meaning for them. Reform rabbis, in interviews and in informal talks at a special session on this theme at the biennial convention of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, criticized organized religious groups for their failure to instill in youth a deep‐rooted awareness of what the holocaust means to contemporary Jewry. They conceded that the problem had been compounded by the fact that most American Jewish youngsters were born after the Hitler regime had been destroyed. Asserting that Jewish college youth “find themselves unrelated to the crucial events which shaped our contemporary Jewish consciousness,” Rabbi Jack Bemporad, director of worship for the union, called it “imperative” that organized Jewligious and secular groups overcome the gap” between those who lived through the Nazi holocaust in the nineteen‐thirties and nineteen‐forties and those born after the end of the Nazi regime in Germany in 1945. Along with other spiritual leaders, Rabbi Bemporad called for an intensified development of curriculum materials in religious schools and synagogues that would focus on the teachings of the holbcaust. In this connection he and other rabbis urged that a day must be set aside annually by the American Jewish community to commemorate the six million Jews who were killed during the Nazi regime. Such a day, they said, would be similar to one that is observed in Israel annually and is known as “Yom Hashoh” — day of the holocaust. Rabbi Jack D. Spiro, director of the union's commission on Jewish education, said that while material was being produced by his group on the holocaust, the “formidable challenge” was to overcome the attitudes of the Jewish youngster. The youngsters, he said, feel that other humanitarian issues facing them surpass the remembrance of the holocaust. Rabbi Roland B. Gittelsohn of Boston said that young Jews frequently responded to the holocaust “by asking why they should become so excited about the murder of Jews a generation ago, when the Vietnamese, Bengalese and many other peoples are being brutally killed.” In urging that a day be set aside by the Jewish community in observance of the holocaust, Rabbi Joseph B. Glaser, executive vice president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the rabbinic arm of American Reform Judaism, cited a remark by his 14‐year‐old son, Simeon, when both were in Israel at the time of the observance: “When the siren began to blow, everybody froze—people, buses—just dead silence —no motion, I really knew then what the holocaust meant.”

149-> South African Interracial Group Seeks to Ease Apartheid Strain
STELLENBOSCH, South Africa—A new high‐level interracial group that is seeking to ease the strains of apartheid has its basis, surprisingly enough, in this placid university city 30 miles east of Capetown, that is a gem of Dutch colonial architecture and a citadel of the Afrikaner intelligentsia. The loose grouping, known as Synthesis, is remarkable because it includes respected black African and other nonwhite spokesmen along with members of the governing National party and of the two other parties in Parliament. Liberal South Africans say they don't expect any immediate change in official thinking as a result of the Synthesis group, but consider it significant nevertheless because of its mere existence and, because it may have influence on a new generation of Nationalist leaders. “Synthesis is a first in South Africa in the sense that it comprises political leaders, members of the conventional Establishment,” said the group's secretary, Dr. Frederik van Zyl Slabbert. “If a consensus has emerged after four round‐table discussions of Synthesis, it is one of mutual concern and a greater degree of tolerance.” Dr. Slabbert, a lecturer in sociology, said in an interview that the 11‐man study, group; in its first meetings the last few months, had discussed a vast range of problems created by the, Government's policy of apartheid, or racial separation, and had questioned many assumptions. “We talk a lot about the viability of the homelands,” Dr. Slabbert said, observing that those areas — the so‐called bantustans — should be considered development projects, rather than a definitive solution to the race problems. The Government has set aside scattered territories totaling 13 per cent of the land as homelands for eight major tribal groups of the blacks, who make up three–fourths of the population of 21 million. Doctrinaire advocates of apartheid propose that the millions of blacks living and working in urban areas reserved for whites be removed to the bantustans eventually, with migratory workers allowed to fill the Manpower needs of industry in the white areas. Dr. Slabbert said that a majority in Synthesis rejected that policy as a way of settling the question of the urban blacks. Synthesis was set up at the suggestion of a National party member, Dr. Louis C. van Oudenhoven, who is close to some in the Government. Other participants are Nic Rhoodie, a Pretoria University professor who is also part of the National party establishment; Japie Basson, a frontbench member of the United party, the major opposition group, and. Colin Eglin, leader of the small Progressive party, which combats apartheid. Black members are Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu tribal group and one of the most vocal black spokesmen; M. Thomas Moerane, a Johannesburg newsman, and Curnick Ndamse, a minister in the Government of the Transkei, a territory that has had bantustan Status since 1963. The Indian community is represented by Pat Poovalingan, a Duitan lawyer, and the Cape Coloreds (those of mixed ancestry) by Dr. R. E. van der Ross, an educator. Another member of the group is Nic Olivier, a Stellenbosch professor who is an authority on black affairs. Synthesis is scheduled to hold its next meeting in a Capetown hotel on Nov. 20. As before it will have to apply for an exemption from the Separate Amenities and Liquor Acts, which forbid convivial interracial gatherings in public places.

150-> Not Political, Aurelio Says
Deputy Mayor Richard R. Aurelio said yesterday that the John V. Lindsay Associations had no intention of disclosing their finances, because they were not political organiza tions. Under state law, political groups must make full financial disclosures. Mr. Aurelio met with news men after Councilman Matthew J. Troy, Queens Democratic leader, displayed an inch‐thick journal published by the John V. Lindsay Association of Queens last February at its an nual dinner. Mr. Troy ques tioned the propriety of numerous full‐page advertise ments paid for by city employes, as well as other ad vertisements that bore the names of business concerns that hold city contracts. Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz announced on Mon day that he was investigating whether the associations had violated the state election laws by failing to disclose their fi nancial condition. Groups Called ‘Nonpartisan’ Mr. Aurelio attributed Mr. Troy's criticism to professional jealousy. He said that “when old‐line political organizations are on the decline, the non partisan John V. Lindsay Asso ciations are thriving through out our city. “The John V. Lindsay Asso ciations,” Mr. Aurelio asserted, “are not political organizations but civic and urban‐improve ment associations committed to progress, reform and urban development.” Asked about advertisements by city employes and com panies with city contracts, the Deputy Mayor said: “There's nothing wrong with a company advertising in a booklet con nected with a civic associa tion.” He added that there was no proof that these advertisements had been solicited either by the associations or by city employes. Coordinators Flee Reporters Mr. Aurelio added that no in come‐tax return had been filed by any of the Lindsay associa tions. “Since they are not profit‐making and have no earnings, they are not required to file returns,” he said. A spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service said last night that if an organization has any any income, it must apply for tax‐exempt status if it wants such status, even if it is a non profit organization. Robert Laird, Mayor Lind say's assistant press secretary, said last night that the Lindsay associations had not filed for tax‐exempt status. Mr. Aurelio walked into the reporters' room at City Hall shortly after a 40‐minute meet ing with the Mayor's five bor ough coordinators, who raced from the building through vari ous exits with reporters in pur suit. The Deputy Mayor denied that the borough coordinators —four of whom are high city officials—ran the associations in the five boroughs. He said that they were merely the Mayor's liaisons to the organi zations, which he contended worked independently from City Hall. Albert J. Ungar, the Mayor's Queens coordinator, pursued into City Hall Park after the meeting in Mr. Aurelio's office, said “no comment” when asked if he personally had solicited advertisements for the dinner journal. Asked how much a full‐page advertisement had cost, Mr. Ungar replied, “$150.” Mayor Lindsay has said that the John V. Lindsay Associa tions paid the bills for his cross country travels during which he “tested the waters” to de termine whether to make a Presidential race. The associations also paid for transportation and hotel costs while he campaigned for candidates across the country, including Charles Evers in Mis sissippi and Richard Hatcher in Gary, Ind. Association funds also have been contributed to political campaigns in New York City and the state. Mr. Aurelio was asked later why he had spoken for the John V. Lindsay Associations if they were independent of City Hall. Mr. Laird said in statement: “We clearly are not saying that the associations have no connection with the adminis tration. Of course, the associ ations are connected with the administration and with the principles of the administration and John V. Lindsay. “Because of that, we have liaisons who work regularly with them, and we agree with the progressive and positive re forms to which the associations are committed.” Davidoff Statement Recalled Ten days ago, however, Sid Davidoff, a mayoral aide, said of the Lindsay associations' potential: “It has served and can con tinue to serve as a political entity, in that it participates in political elections. In some areas the John V. Lindsay Association is the political or ganization. There's just no other organization. We think we have the ability to turn out a pretty good campaign force.” Mr. Davidoff, who said Mon day he was the citywide co ordinator for the associations, was asked yesterday to recon cile his statement with Mr. Aurelio's position. He said: “No one disputes that the John V. Lindsay Associations have political input, but their main function is for urban and civic improvement.” Mr. Davidoff added that precedent for not filing a finan cial statement with the state was the organization Women's Strike for Peace, an antiwar group that supported Congres sional candidates but that, ac cording to Mr. Davidoff, has never filed a financial state ment. Mr. Troy said early last eve ning that he would hold a news conference this afternoon at which “I'll bring irrefutable proof that they are a political organization in the form of letter from Mayor Lindsay to Al Unger in 1968.”

151-> Superscope Antitrust Suit Filed Against Sony Corp.
Superscope, Inc., a distribu tor of Sony tape recorders, said yesterday that it was filing $149‐million antitrust suit in Los Angeles District Court against Sony and was seeking to prevent Sony from canceling a distributorship deal expiring Dec. 31, 1974. Although Superscope said it had indications that the Sony Corporation did not intend to renew, Sony denied that it had made such a statement to Su perscope. Sony said in Tokyo it would not make any com mitment now.

152-> Europeans Find Economy Deterred by U.S. Moves
Italians call it the worst eco nomic crisis since World War II. Argentines speak of “stag nation.” The Germans com plain that the foundations of free enterprise are in danger. The Japanese see a recession. Hardly any country, a survey by correspondents of The New York Times indicates, seems to have found the right medicine that would invigorate industrial production and at the same time cut inflation and unem ployment. Even Canada, which has es caped a recessionary slowdown, faces a nagging unemployment situation. Further, most nations feel that they will get no help from President Nixon's new econom ic program. To the contrary. The Execu tive Commission of the Euro pean Economic Community, in a quarterly report released late last week, predicted an aggra vation of the slowdown in in dustrial activity and a deterioration in the balance of trade because of the program. The commission warned that the six‐nation community, or Common Market, faced its most difficult economic situation since its creation at the be ginning of 1958. A commission official stated: “The report shows that the United States trade and mone tary measures are going to ag gravate a situation that al ready was deteriorating.” The report stated that al ready there were signs that in vestment is slowing down be cause of the 10 per cent import surcharge imposed by the Unit ed States Aug. 15 and growing uncertainty about the risks of overcapacity. On foreign trade, the report said that United States “pro tectionism” meant that demand for Common Market exports would probably settle at a rela tively low level. Consequently, the upturn in world trade that began earlier this year would be “slowed down considerably” by the United States action. Following are summaries on individual nations as prepared by correspondents of The Times: The French are looking for growth next year of slightly more than 5 per cent, but everybody is keeping his fin gers crossed. The French have tried to in sulate themselves from reces sionary forces by keeping their exchange rate in commercial transactions at the old parity. Thus they are hoping for a devaluation effect that would stimulate exports. Export‐led industrial expansion is the top French economic priority to put France in better position vis‐a vis West Germany. But the mood of the business community is still a little gloomy. The monetary disorder and the two‐tier exchange mar ket have caused French busi nessmen to delay investment projects and sit tight on cash. Consumers are still saving at a high rate and restraining their purchases. The French stock market hast taken one of the sharpest dives of any market in Europe—off 15 per cent since Aug. 15. A debate is raging in Britain over whether the economy is recovering from the recession in the first half this year when the gross national product was down 1 per cent from the last half of 1970. Consumer spending, construc tion and business confidence have all revived, but industrial production is flat, and capital spending is down. Some economists estimate the underlying growth rate at 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent as a result of the Government's stimulus to consumer spending with tax cuts in July. But many fear a consumer led boom would not be soundly based. Industrial production from August, 1970, to August, 1971, was up only 1 per cent. Un employment is at a postwar high of about 900,000, or 3.9 per cent of the labor force. Re tail prices are up 10.3 per cent over the year‐ago levels. Worried about monetary un certainties, the head of a major chemical company warned re cently that repeated upward re valutions of the mark (there were two in as many years) could force companies to build production facilities outside the country. Latest statistics show that industrial production in August was 7.2 per cent down from July, and 1.7 per cent from August 1970. Reflecting the gradual but slow decline of economic activ ity, the growth rate of indus trial production in August was 2.2 per cent, as against 2.7 per cent in July and 3.1 per cent in June. Swiss industrialists are be ginning to look worried. The official quarterly index of in dustrial output at the middle of the year was 147, exactly where it was 12 months ago. Since then, there have been other signs pointing to a change in the economic climate. Among them has been a series of cut backs in employment by Alu suisse, an aluminum maker with worldwide holdings, and by major companies in the show and paper industries. Investors are also viewing the future with concern, as re flected in the retreat in the index for Swiss shares from 355 on the day of President Nixon's economic message on Aug. 15 to under 330. The concern stems mostly from the fear that the Swiss export industry, the backbone, of the nation's economic life, may be particularly hit by in ternational repercussions to Mr. Nixon's program. Italy's Minister of Industry last week described the coun try's economic climate as one of “uncertainty” and Italians in general are worried about the economic slump because solu tions are not visible. Renato Lombardi, chairman of the General Confederation of Italian Industry, termed the cur rent state of the economy as the “gravest since World War II.” He reported that there were nearly one million unemployed and underemployed, or 400,000 more than last year. Other signs of the country's “malessere” (malaise) are: In dustrial production dropped by 3.5 per cent in the first eight months this year, while con sumer prices were 5 per cent higher in September than a year ago. Housing starts in June were 22.7 per cent below that of the same month a year ago. Mr. Nixon's economic pro gram has added salt to the wounds. A Cabinet member said that the American restric tions had provoked “grave repercussions, particularly on the psychological plane, and in the long run would also influ ence the economy.” There are few signs of ob vious recession in Belgium, though the rate of growth has slowed because of a combina tion of internal factors and ex ternal economic uncertainty. Growth in the second quarter fell 5.5 per cent, compared with 7.8 per cent in the first three months of the year. The number of hours worked in manufacturing industries has also undergone a slow but steady decline, after remaining stable during the first quarter of the year. Belgium's Ministry of Economics also reports that there are signs that the demand is tending to fall off in some basic sectors, which in turn could cause a reduction of new orders in several other indus tries. Belgian exports to the United States are heavily dependent on steel and textiles, both of which are greatly affected by the chances of voluntary agree ments being reached that would result in a lifting of the 10 per cent surcharge. The Common Market com mission, in its quarterly report on community economies, stresses that there is little like lihood, however, of Belgium's moving into a period of rela tively low economic activity. The commission predicts that the economic rate of activities will remain high throughout the rest of this year, although growth will be relatively low. Because of this, there are ex pected to be few signs, such as unemployment, associated with a full‐scale recession. There is no recessionary trend in the Canadian economy. In fact, it has been picking up speed. Nevertheless, there is a problem—unemployment. It has been rising, to 7.1 per cent in September, just when it was supposed to drop. Consequent ly, Ottawa has just unwrapped a $1‐billion package of fiscal medicine in the form of tax cuts and higher spending. Paradoxically, figures on the economy are encouraging. The gross national product in cur rent dollars has been rising at increasing speed, at an annual rate of 8.4 per cent in the spring quarter as against barely 3 per cent in 1970. Meanwhile, the annual rate of inflation has eased. Industrial production and housing starts have been set ting records. Consumer confi dence is on the upswing. Em ployment is up smartly from a year ago. But the number of job‐seekers is up even more, and so the unemployment rate has risen. Apart from the last fact, the economic data look good and the outlook is promising. Yet, the stock market is down. Un certainty is rife in the business community, and could persist “for some months,” according to a confidential analysis by a major bank. The industrial index on the Toronto Stock Exchange closed on Friday at 162.22, as against a 1971 high of 188.94 on April 15. Most of the decline since then came after the Aug. 15 announcement of a more pro tectionist United States eco nomic policy. If that protec tionism proves to be permanent and contagious, Canada could have grave problems. What the Japanese call a re cession is usually termed a slowdown in the growth rate elsewhere. The Government's economic planning agency has predicted that Japan's growth rate would drop from an originally esti mated 10.1 per cent to 5.5 per cent in the current fiscal year ending May 31. The import surcharge im posed by President Nixon and the subsequent floating of the yen are generally given as the major reasons for the slow down. Industrial production in Sep tember dropped 0.7 per cent and corporate investment will rise only fractionally. The wholesale price index, which had been relatively steady all year, dropped from 110.9 in August to 110.6 in Sep tember and to 110.1 during the first 10 days of October. But consumer prices, which have been shooting up steadily during the country's economic expansion, reached a new high of 146.2 in September. This was 10.3 per cent increase over the year‐earlier period. South Africa last week heard gloomy warnings by some of its leading economists that the country was balancing on a knife edge with the danger of gross inflation on one side and a serious recession on the other. The growth rate of industry, which last year was 5.2 per cent, against an original target of 6.7 per cent, has further slowed down this year, although no exact figures are available. The output of mines, still an important sector of industry, is stationary. It is now foreseen that the over‐all economic growth rate for 1971 will be 3.5 to 4 per cent, against a target of 5.5 per cent. Argentina is bogged down in the middle of a stagflation (a combination of stagnation and inflation) swamp, and the root is political upheaval. Although the armed forces are still in the saddle, they have changed Presidents twice in less than two and one‐half years and a procession of min isters, all with different poli cies, has mismanaged the economy since the military took over in June, 1966. Currently inflation is gallop ing ahead, by 39.6, per cent ac cording, to the official cost of living index. But, because of a price freeze on consumer goods, the wholesale price index is more accurate. It records an in crease of 45.8 per cent. The gross domestic product rose only by 3.7 per cent in the second quarter this year, against an objective of 6 per cent.

153-> Yen at 10.87% High
TOKYO, Dec. 6—The yen was traded today at its highest rate since it was floated on Aug. 28, 324.70 yen to the dollar, as a result of the heavy sales of American currency in the Tokyo foreign‐exchange market. Turn over amounted to $148,790,000. The rate was equivalent to an upward revaluation of 10.87 per cent for the Japanese cur rency over the old official par ity of 360 yen to the dollar. The increased dollar selling was attributed partly to the ac tive conclusion of export con tracts by small and medium companies that resulted in an increase of dollar deposits for disposal and partly to the steps taken by trading concerns to discount their export bills hur riedly. The Government began today the first of a series of confer ences of key Cabinet ministers to work out Japan's position in the coming conference in Wash ington on the realignment of currencies. Also under consid eration are domestic measures to cope with the deflationary consequences for the country's economy that a sharp revalua tion would likely produCe. There is a strong trend of thought in Government and business circles that a revalua tion of 15 per cent or more of the yen would plunge the coun try's economy further into a prolonged recession and that the Government therefore should attempt to hold revalua tion to the possible minimum.

154-> WAGNER DEFEATS ALBRIGHT, 27‐14
READING, Pa., Oct. 16—Jake Ellis's record‐breaking perform ance powered Wagner College to a 27‐14 victory over Albright today before a Homecoming Day crowd of 3,500 at Albright Stadium. Ellis, who made the switch to tailback from his defensive cornerback position last week, broke Neil Leonard's 19‐year single‐game rushing mark with a 169‐yard effort. The old standard was 160 yards. The Sea Hawks jumped to a 13‐7 first‐quarter advantage on Ellis's 4‐yard run and 9‐yard touchdown pass from Jim Fagan to a flanker, Lonnie Brandon. Both clubs added touchdowns in the second period, as Wagner held a 19‐14 half‐time lead. The Sea Hawks took the game out of reach in the final period on Larry Schmidt's 1‐yard touch down plunge. ??

155-> NASSAU WILL SUE ITS CITIES ON TAX
MINEOLA, L. I., Dec, 6 — Nassau County Executive Ralph G. Caso said today that the county would sue in State Su preme Court here this week to prevent Use cities of Glen Cove and Long Beach from “illegal ly usurping” the county's right to a one‐cent‐on‐the‐dollar in crease in the sales tax in their jurisdictions. The county Board of Super visors unanimously approved the increase last week, to be come effective March 1. The total sales tax in the county will then be 7 cents on the dollars — 4 for the state and 3 for the county. The increase, which is ex pected to provide $34‐million more in a 10‐month period, was proposed by Mr. Caso to help balance a record budget of $426‐million for next year. Mr. Caso said the imposition of the additional sales tax would permit a reduction in property tax rates. The present tax rate of $5.86 for each $100 of assessed val uation would be reduced by about 19 cents, but a substan tial increase in the tax rate in the Police District would cut the over‐all tax decrease to 3 cents. Mr. Caso contended that the property tax rate for most of the county's residents would have had to be increased by about $1.04 for each $100 of assessed valuation without the one‐cent increase in the sales tax. He said today that the meth od used by Glen Cove and Long Beach to obtain the one‐ cent tax proceeds for their own use were improper. In Long Beach, he said, the action to obtain the tax came a day after the county law was amended to raise the sales tax. In Glen Cove, he noted, the City Council passed a res olution to pre‐empt the sales tax. It was estimated that Long Beach would obtain $365,000 by pre‐empting the sales tax and Glen Cove would get $400, 000. A suit brought by three Democrats, challenging the le gality of Mr. Caso's budget on the ground that its form vio lated the County Charter, was dismissed today by State Su preme Court Justice L. Kings ley Smith. The Democrats said they would appeal.

159-> Despite Slump, a Stable Enclave
ATLANTA — The South east is anticipating signifi cant economic growth in the coming decade, even though achieving it may be more difficult than in resent years. Behind the ?? tions this region has for 1971 and beyond is a decade of remarkable expansion. Even more notable was the rela tive stability the region en joyed during the recession year of 1970. “It's going to be much harder for this area to dupli cate its rate of growth in the sixties, even though it will certainly outstrip the growth rate of the nation,” says Carl E. Sanders, a for mer Governor of Georgia and now a leading lawyer in the state. Mr. Sanders, along with Richard Rich, chairman of Rich's department store here, and other business and gov ernmental leaders in the South Atlantic region, cite many reasons behind its po tential. Few cyclical indus tries, an abundance of raw materials, a mild climate, a diversity of power availabil ity, an expansion of exports and an ability to reach vast markets through overnight deliveries dominated their lists. The region's momentum is easily documented by many of the statistics compiled by Federal agencies about the Southeast — the 12‐state area of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. The greatest economic ex pansion in the country dur ing the last decade took place here. For example, while the population increase of the 12 states was fractionally below that of the United States as a whole, personal income in the region more than dou bled as the national average growth approximated 90 per cent. The difference in the gain in manufacturing em ployment was even more striking — 41 per cent for the Southeast and 20 per cent for the country. Over the 10‐year period, retail sales advanced 74 per cent, while effective buying income jumped 83 per cent. Construction contract awards in the latest 12‐month period for which figures are avail able leaped 26 per cent in the Sixth Federal Reserve District and fell 6 per cent nationally. More People Moving In Moreover, George H. Brown, director of the Cen sus Bureau, notes that “for the first time since the 1870's the past decade has shown more people moved into the South than out of it and the population of the South is becoming metropolitan at twice the rate of the North.” And while per‐capita in come throughout the United States between 1960 and 1970 increased 80 per cent, the advance in eight South Atlantic states and the Dis trict of Columbia was 99 per cent. Look at some of the key cities in the area. Atlanta, transportation and distribu tion center, saw the con struction of 50 new down town buildings during the decade, with 17 reaching at least 15 stories high. “Sheer demand for hous ing at any cost here is grow ing at the rate of 100,000 units a year,” says J. B. Fu qua, chairman or Fuqua In dustries, Inc., an Atlanta‐ based conglomerate. The leading banking insti tution in the city is the Citi zens and Southern National Bank, and its president, Mills B. Lane Jr., has his own theories on local growth pat terns. “The South was tra ditionally an exporter of manpower but today you've had a complete reversal,” he asserts. Richmond, Va., boasts of its 10‐year growth of whole saling from $1.3‐billion to $2.4‐billion, a rise in value added by manufacturing from $520‐million to $778‐million and of savings and loan de posits from $129‐million to $271‐million. “Of course, our area start ed at a lower base than others,” says William B. Thal heimer Jr., president of Thal heimer's, the largest depart ment store group in Virginia, with its flagship store in Richmond. “Nevertheless, we've been getting a faster influx of industry — and it's a widely diversified group of companies.” Savannah, Ga., also has been moving rapidly ahead from a base beneath that of many Northern cities. House hold income in the metropoli tan area of this busy port city and tourist center zoomed 77 per cent in the decade of the sixties, while retail sales have advanced 95 per cent in the last five years. High‐Wage Industries Such diversification is im portant to this section of the country because its major in dustries are markedly differ ent from those in the United States as a whole. Transpor tation equipment, nonelec trical machinery and elec trical machinery — all high ??age industries and frequent ly defense‐related — are the largest groups in the coun try. In the Southeast, how ever, the three top places are held by textiles, apparel and food, which are mostly low‐wage industries. In the last decade apparel employment rose by more than 60 per cent here (four times the national average) and textile employment ad vanced by 21 per cent (three times the national average). Besides manufacturing, many more aspects of the Southeastern economy show greater than average devel opment in recent years. Whether it is the population growth of the Miami area— up 30 per cent in the nine teen‐sixties — or food sales in Durham, N. C. — up 149 per cent in that period — the South is rising again. “Our people are so busy planning and serving ship pers that we don't know how bad things are,” says R. R. Smith, president of Smith's Transfer Corporation of Staunton, Va,, a large truck ing company. The ‘Pacesetter’ King D. Cleveland, presi dent of the National Bank of Georgia, says: “While other sections are analyzing prob lems of the past and coping with problems of the pres ent, we are looking to the opportunities of the future.” Some Southerners are less sure that everything will be milk and honey in the years ahead. One business leader, for instance, says: “I think our tax structure is inade quate for the growth that's predicted. And there's still too much political separatism down here that has to have an economic effect on us.” Nevertheless, the prevail ing opinion in these parts is that 1971 will be the be ginning of a new upsurge in the Southeast. “When the black man goes from $3,000 to $6,000 a year in average salary, all of us are going to rise with him.” declares Ivan Allen Jr., former Mayor of Atlanta and a senior mer chant here. “This is our greatest hope in the next 10 years.”

160-> IRAQ ANNOUNCES OIL PRICE ACCORD
BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 7— Iraq and the foreign oil com panies operating there conclud ed a priding agreement tonight. The Baghdad radio, announc ing the accord, said that Iraq's income from oil in 1971 would rise to approximately $990‐mil lion from $549‐million last year. Judging by the highly tech nical agreement, Iraq did not get all that she had asked for. The agreement, which raises the posted price of Iraq's oil exports from the Mediterra nean, does not give the Gov ernment a 10‐cent premium for each barrel, which was grant ed to Libya in April. The premium to Libya was for the low‐sulphur content of her crude. The Iraqis insisted that they should get the same premium because, they argued, Iraqi crude has qualities that more than make up for its higher sulphur content. The announcement said that in the agreement. Iraq received the same benefits as Libya with the exception of the pre mium on sulphur content. The statement said, however, that Iraq received other bene fits, such as a promise by the foreign oil companies to in crease Iraq's production and exports both from the fields in the north and the south. Since 1920, Iraqi oil has been produced by the Iraq Petro leum Company, owned by British Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, Compagnie Française des Petroles and Standard Oil of New Jersey. Under the agreement, the Iraq Petroleum Company is to give the Government a new loan of about $30‐million. Fur ther, the company has agreed to postpone for four years the payment, by the Government of an earlier loan of about $60‐ million. Fifty million tons of Iraqi crude are expected annually at Mediterranean terminals in Syria and Lebanon via an oil pipeline owned by Iraq Petro leum. Under the agreement, Iraq's posted price was increased 80 cents a barrel, bringing the price to $3.21.

161-> Vietnamese Face Vast Uprooting
SAIGON, South Vietnam, Jan. 10 — South Vietnamese and American officials here have disclosed plans for what is ex pected to be the largest organized movement of peasants in the history of Vietnam. The Saigon Government, with full American support, hopes to resettle the refugees in more sparsely populated provinces. The peasants are to be moved to the two southernmost mili tary regions, called III Corps and IV Corps. Estimates of the total num ber to be involved in the move ment vary. American sources cite figures ranging from 200, 000 to more than a million, de pending on security and the wil lingness of the peasants. South Vietnamese officials, however, confirm that the movement could involve between two mil lion and three million peasants throughout two military regions during the next three years. It is an attempt by the South Vietnamese to solve chronic ref ugee problems in the northern most military zone, called I Corps. Some American officials here have expressed fear that the movement will create more physical and psychological stress than the peasants, al ready bewildered by the war, can handle. They add that the movement will add greatly to postwar social reconstruction problems. South Vietnamese officials feel the vast movement will be acceptable to the refugees who have already broken ties with their ancestral plots, so im portant as centers of Vietna mese religious worship. Some Vietnamese, sharply critical of the movement, say that the plan is a political move by the Government against the Vietnamese of the northernmost provinces, who have consistently resisted con trol by the Saigon Government. The area has been tradition ally sympathetic to the Commu nists and remains the poorest economic region in South Viet nam. By moving the peasants, these critics say, the Govern ment would attempt to disperse its opposition at the cost of still more suffering. The project, already approved in principle by the highest South Vietnamese and American offi cials, is now in its final plan ning stages and will be an nounced soon by Saigon. A new agency will be formed to handle the movement. The project will be financed by the United States, according to Franklin Stewart, the direc tor of the War Victims Program in Vietnam. “We expect that this year's allotted refugee fund will he ex hausted during the first two months of the program. Mr. stewart said. “After that we hope to get additional money from the U.S. Government.” “The costs of the project after all would be too much for the South Vietnamese Govern ment to handle at this time,” he said. The Minister of Social Wel fare, Dr. Tran Nguon Phieu, said the plan had been considered for several years but had not been acted on because of the “political Implications” of mov ing peasants out of the north ern provinces during the initial period of the Paris peace talks. “Only now do we feel that we can go ahead with the plan. Before this time political ob servers watching the peace talks in Paris would have seen the move as a preparation for handing over the area to the North Vietnamese,” he said. “I expect the movement will begin this spring, when the monsoon season in central Vietnam ends and work becomes possible.” Difficulties for Saigon Refugees in the five northern most provinces of South Viet nam have long been a source of frustration for officials here. Since 1965, the fighting there has often been heaviest. Search‐ and‐destroy operations have sent hundreds of thousands of refugees into relocation centers near urban areas, where the peasants have lived off an econ omy sustained by American troops. Security in rural areas and unexploded mines and bombs have often made village resettlement impossible. Refugee officals here estimate that about a million Vietnamese continue to live in what is termed “nonviable” conditions in I Corps. Unofficial estimates run even higher. “The success of the pilot proj ect, the resettlement of the Cambodian refugees, has en couraged us to begin a land de velopment project in general, the Minister of State, Dr. Phan Quang Dan, said. Dr. Dan headed a program that resettled more than 200, 000 refugees from Cambodia. He is expected to head the new, resettlement project. Loss of Jobs Is Noted “For years we have spent billions in the I Corps and have achieved nothing. Our idea now, is to settle hard‐core refugees on new land. It is just nonsense to dole out money to them without giving them solutions.” Dr. Dan said. “We are facing tremendous economic problems,” he, went on in accented but clear Eng lish. “The withdrawal of Ameri can troops is now beginning to be felt.” “Sixty thousand families have already lost their jobs. There will be twice as many in '71 and after that many more,” he said. “But we have two tremendous assets,” he continued, “rich land and a disciplined army. We can resettle soldiers and their families on land which together can add greatly to development of the country. Gradual Beginning “At first the relocation proj ect will be gradual,” he said. “Village representatives will be brought down to look at the land. Then they will go back and tell the people what they have seen. I figure we can bring down 200,000 within the first six months. That would be a good beginning.” In response to a question as to whether some peasants would be forced to move, the minister Said, “For those who say yes, we would bring them right away. The others will follow, I know. They are like sheep. We know from the Cambodian ex perience that the peasants will jump at the opportunity to have new land.” In the past, such big move ments have been avoided by re fugee officials here. Only one such movement has occurred during the course of the war. It involved 3,000 peasants who were settled in the Camranh Bay area. Vietnamese peasants are known to have strong ties to the graves of their ancestors. Both Buddhist and Roman Catholic Vietnamese traditions encourage respect for ancestors. Some American refugee ad visers are showing opposition, charging that the new move ment would create even more rootless Vietnamese. One American adviser, who asked not to be identified, said: “I am afraid that if they try to settle refuges in our province the peasants will eventually move to Saigon to join the ur ban slums. I am opposed to the movement. I know other Amer ican advisers are opposed. In the long run, it will only add another tragedy to our already tragic involvement here.” Mr. Stewart, however, be lieves that the peasants will have a choice. “Our first priority Is to let Vietnamese settle in their own villages,” he said. “If that is not possible, we want them to re settle them as near as possible to their lands. In all cases it will be our policy to have vol untary movement where we are dealing with permanent reloca tion of refugees.” History of Moving “I know some people feel the Vietnamese peasants want to remain near their ancestral graves,” Dr. Dan said. “But look back at Vietnamese history. Vietnamese have been moving south for centuries.” “This will be the largest or ganized movement of Vietna mese in all of Vietnamese his tory,” he noted with pride. “I feel that ancestral ties are important but are overstressed. A chance to farm land is more important to the peasant,” he said. Vietnamese have been mov ing south from the Tonkin re gion — now North Vietnam— since the eleventh century. The move has been gradual, with Vietnamese clashing for centur ies with the Chams, an Indian civilization that occupied pres ent day central Vietnam, and later with Cambodians in the nineteenth century. The largest refugee movement came in 1954, when 850,000 left North Vietnam to resettle in the south, where they awaited the unification of the country which was to follow elections in 1956,

162-> Vietnam Veterans: A Battle for Jobs
WASHINGTON — The young man who manages to make it home from Vietnam still has one final battle to fight. He must find a job. ployment sterns from deliber ate Government policies to a very large degree.” The Jobs‐for‐Veterans Com mittee has a budget of $200, 000, a minuscule amount by Washington standards. Never theless, it already has sent out some 5 million “hire‐a vet” pamphlets to major and minor businesses, governors, mayors and news organiza tions. Although committee offi cials cannot yet say what effect the pamphlet campaign is having, the past perform ance of private employers of fers little hope. For instance, a year or so ago when the Office of Economic Opportu nity asked a hundred Balti more companies what special hiring practices they had for veterans, only 28 companies bothered to reply and only two of them were actively recruiting ex‐servicemen. The jobless veteran's best employment bet ??nese days is one of the hundreds of local, state and Federal un employment offices. There also are about 70 special “as sistance centers” that the Veterans Administration has set up to advise ex‐service men on everything from jobs to G.I. Bill benefits. But the veteran who drops by one of these offices or centers should be prepared for disappointment. “Day in and day out,” says Oscar McDaniel of the Chi cago assistance center, “about the best we can do is find work for one of every five men The rest just have to keep coming back.” In between return visits, the jobless veteran may draw unemployment compensation. Most checks run about $50 a week and most recipients remain on the payments list at least two months. Having to join the ranks of the jobless increases the bitterness many ex‐service men feel about the war. This is particularly true of blacks, who generally are unemploy ed and underemployed at higher rates than whites. As William Randolph of Washington, a black ex‐heli copter door gunner, says: “I went to this dumb war and I did my share for my country. But I came home to hard times and no apprecia tion. What we veterans need is some sort of Government run readjustment program to assure that we get back into the system on equal terms with the civilians.”

ORONO, Me., Oct. 16—Con necticut maintained its football jinx over Maine by defeating the Bears, 21‐7, today behind the quarterbacking of Bob Ro bustelli. It was Connecticut's sixth straight triumph over the Blue and White since 1965. The Huskies had to come from a 7‐0 deficit, and Robus telli was the key figure. He drove them 90 yards near the end of the second period for the tying score, with Lou Allen going over from the 2. Robustelli got the second Connecticut touchdown in the third period on a 1‐yard sneak. Then Bob Warren ran 30 yards with a punt return into the end zone. ??

165-> Panel to Select L.I.U. Head
A 15‐member panel has been assembled by the chancellor pf Long Island University, Albert Bush‐Brown, to screen and select candidates for the presidency of the university's main campus in Brooklyn. The committee represents several campus groups, most or which are composed of students or faculty members. Only two of the 15 panel members are university administrators and two more are alumni. The search and screening committee is headed by Prof. Leslie Jacobson of the L.I.U. biology department. The vice chairman is a student, Keith Barnard. The group is charged with conducting a search for three suitable persons to nominate for the office. The panel must determine the qualifications and the willingness to serve of the candidates and submit three names to the university's board of trustees. One of the three will then be named president. This is the second time that L.I.U. has used this process to appoint a highranking university official. A similar committee was established last January to select q chancellor for the university and it resulted in the selection of Mr. BushBrown. The system was agreed upon by the trustees to meet a university statute that requires them to consult with students, faculty members and alumni on major administrative appointments. Dr. Jacobson revealed that she already had two possible candidates. Although their names have not been released, one of them is thought to be Eugene Arden, the executive dean of the. Brooklyn Center, who has said that he wants to be considered for the presidency. Mr. Arden has been running the college since the departure of its former president, Alexander Aldrich, on Oct. 1. Mr. Aldrich, a cousin of Governor Rockefeller, resigned the post to become the New York State Commissioner of Parks and Recreation. During Mr. Aldrich's tenure and before, the Brooklyn Center was faced by a financial crisis brought about at least in part by inflation and open enrollment in the City University system. The acute, problem is likely to be passed on to the next president. There has been a sharp drop in enrollment at the Brooklyn Center, which op. crates almost entirely, on income from student tuition. According to the university treasurer, Mrs. Mary Lai, the college has just managed to break even in the last two years. This year, the chancellor has ordered, an $800,000 cut in the Brooklyn Center budget, and Mrs. Lai says it reduces the projected deficit to $210,000. The total budget for the college this year is $12.8‐million, down $1‐mil lion from last year. Chancellor Bush‐Brown says he hopes a successor to Mr. Aldrich can be named by January. The 18‐acre liberal arts college is in downtown Brooklyn and presently has an enrollment of 7,000.

166-> Refugees and Cholera Increase in India
CALCUTTA, India, June 7 (Reuters)—The number of East ??stani refugees flooding into India reportedly neared five million today. Cholera in epi demic proportions threatened this squalid capital of West Bengal state. In New Delhi, Health Minister Uma Shankar Dixit told Par liament today that, as of Fri day, the number of refugees was 4,738,054. But some observers felt that the total now could have passed five million. Mr. Dixit said the central Government's information indi cated that 1,250 refugees had died in the cholera epidemic up to Friday and that 9,500 others were in hospitals. However, informed sources in Calcutta said on Saturday that the death toll was about 8,000. Government health officials said they had no precise figures, but agreed it could be as high as 8,000. Twelve new cases of cholera were reported today at a bigl refugee camp near the Calcutta airport, bringing to about 100 the reported number of victims of the disease in the camp. Twenty‐three deaths have been reported at the camp— mostly infants and old persons —since the first of 40,000 refu gees started to gather there 12 days ago. The deaths were vari ously attributed to disease, ex haustion and malnutrition, and it was not known precisely how many were caused by cholera. No new cholera victims were reported at a second camp with in the Calcultta city limits since six persons were taken to a hospital late last week. But the disease, which attacks the gastrointestinal system, was still reported raging in epidemic proportions in other camps throughout West Bengal. Roy Chowdhury, administra tor of the camp near the air port, said today that work would begin tomorrow on a new camp about two miles east of his installation. It was ex pected to house 15,000 to 20, 000 refugees who now seek shelter from the steaming mon soon conditions under trees and bushes along the roads to Calcutta. The new camp is being set up at a Boy Scout center de spite the wish of the West Bengal Government to move all refugees at least 20 miles from the city, for both political and health reasons. The population of Calcutta has swollen to more than 12 million with the influx of re fugees. The redugees pose a grave political threat to the Govern ment, which is spending mil lions of dollars to aid the flee ing East Pakistanis—money de sperately needed by millions of poverty‐stricken Indians. There have already been complaints that the refugees, who are receiving a free daily food ration from the Govern ment, are seeking jobs and driv ing down the price of labor which, in many cases, only keeps Indians at subsistence level at the best of times. The refugee flow began after the Pakistani Army's crackdown March 25 and its drive against East Pakistani secessionists. In New Delhi, Mr. Dixit, who was speaking during a special session of parliament on the cholera outbreak, said that as of Friday 2,722,561 refugees were being housed in camps in the states of West Bengal, Assam and Bihar and the ter ritories of Meghalaya and Tri pura. In addition, 2,015,493 were outside camps, mainly sleeping in the open, he said.

168-> Chanel, the Couturier, Dead in Paris
PARIS, Jan. 10—Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel, one of the greatest couturiers of the 20th century, died tonight in her apartment at the Ritz Hotel. She was 87 years old. The death of Coco, as she was known the world over, was announced by close friends. They said that her death came peacefully and that nothing in recent days had in dicated she was in bad health. The cause of death was not immediately known. Her friends said that chambermaid discovered that Coco was ill and called a phy sician. Coco's death occurred as she was working on her col lection to be presented in the spring fashion shows this month. Her life story was turned into a musical, “Coco,” which ran on Broadway last year starring Katharine Hepburn in her first singing and dancing role. Miss Hepburn, 60 at the time the show opened, was termed “too old” for the part by the tart tongued Coco, Who was 86. In addition to Chanel philoso phy, the show featured many models parading in the pop ular fashions Chanel designed through her long career. Chanel dominated the Paris fashion world in the nineteen twenties and at the height of her career was running four business enterprises—a fashion house, a textile business, per fume laboratories and a work shop for costume jewelry— that altogether employed 3,500 workers. It was perhaps her perfume more than her fashions that made the name Chanel famous around the world. Called simply “Chanel No. 5”—she had been told by a fortune‐teller that five was her lucky number—it made Coco a millionaire.

169-> BOND. PRICES END A 2‐WEEK DECLINE
The credit markets stabilized Yesterday, ending—temporarily at least—the decline in bond prices that set in two weeks ago. Yields on new issues of taxexempt and corporate bonds were raised slightly, and investors bought enough of them to encourage investment bankers to become somewhat more optimistic that the slide in prices since March 23 was over. The evidence for this stability was not ironclad, however. Halsey, Stuart ran the books for two of the four large tax‐exempt bond sales yesterday, and it did not divulge how many of the bonds were sold. Similarly, in the corporate bond market, no exact estimate of sales was disclosed for the $25‐million of Louisiana Power and Light Company bonds, an A‐rated issue priced to yield 7.70 per cent by a group run by Eastman Dillon. But enough bonds were sold and the bond market showed enough bounce to make dealers conclude that fixed‐income securities had turned something of a corner. After the bond market rallied throughout early March, it turned downward on March 23 when the Standard Oil Company of California's $250‐million of Aaa‐rated debentures were priced to yield 7 per cent and failed to get as enthusiastic a reception as expected. Yesterday, the Blyth‐Dean Witter syndicate that had been offering the issue disbanded, and the bonds declined 11/4 points, lifting their yield to 7.13 per cent. The Government bond market reversed a decline yesterday and closed with small gains. Treasury bills, which had been rising almost uninterruptedly in rate since March 11, closed unchanged yesterday. While the credit markets were seeking this degree of stability, financing activity was heavy in corporate bonds and non‐Federal securities. In the tax‐exempt market, Ohio awarded $50‐million of higher‐education bonds to a group managed by Halsey, Stuart, and the state sold $25‐million of highway‐Improvement bonds to a First National City Bank syndicate. The higher‐education bonds were priced to yield from 2.50 per cent for those maturing in 1972 to 5.40 per cent for those coming due in 1996. The highway bonds were scaled to yield from 2.30 per cent in 1972 to 4.85 per cent in 1989. While both issues are rated Aa by Moody's, the higher‐education bonds carried a higher yield because they are secured by appropriations every other year by the Ohio General Assembly for the state's Board of Regents. The highway bonds are payable from motor‐vehicle registration fees. The yields, on the highway bonds were frequently 5 to 15 basis points higher than the similarly rated Michigan bonds marketed March 30 in the preceding sale of Aa‐rated state bonds. Late yesterday, the $25‐million Ohio highway issue was reported down to an unsold ballance of $10.9‐million. The unsold balance on the $50‐million higher‐education issue was not made public. Oregon sold $45‐million of Aa‐rated antipollution bonds to a Bankers Trust syndicate, and it awarded $2.5‐million of college‐building bonds to a Halsey, Stuart group. The larger issue was priced to yield practically the same as the Ohio highway bond issue, and $23.5‐million was reported unsold late in the afternoon. In the fourth large taxexempt financing, Memphis awarded $21‐million of Memphis bonds, rated Aa, to another Halsey, Stuart group yesterday afternoon. No report of sales was available. The Texas Water Development Board attempted to sell $25‐million of Aaa‐rated bonds at an interest cost no higher than 4 per cent, but it received no bids. In the short‐term tax‐exempt securities sector, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that $457,803,000 of housing‐project notes had been sold at an average interest rate of 2.331 per cent, up from 2.135 per cent in a similar financing last month. Thirty banking groups won portions of the notes. The Bank of America and Bankers Trust jointly purchased $146.48‐mil lion, while a group comprised of First National City Bank, Continental Illinois Bank, First Boston, Mellon National Bank and Goldman, Sachs bought $132,325,000. In the corporate‐bond market, several major issues were readied for sale today. A syndicate headed by Morgan Stanley is expected to offer $100‐million of W. T. Grant Company 25‐year Baarated convertible debentures with a 4¾ per cent interest rate and a conversion price of $73 a share, or 18.45 per cent above the closing price of 61⅝ yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. A group jointly managed by Blyth and Dean Witter will sell 3 million shares of Pacific Gas and Electric Company 8.16 per cent $25‐par preferred stock at $27.375 a share to yield 7.45 per cent. The stock carried $2.04 annual dividend rate. Goldman, Sachs and its associates are expected to offer, $30 ‐ million of Brown Shoe Company notes maturing April 15, 1978, as 6½'s at 99¾ to yield 6.55 per cent. They are rated A by Moody's and AA by Standard & Poor's, and they have a sinking fund—thought to be a new wrinkle for such notes—that begins in 1974 and retires 80 per cent of the issue prior to maturity. Louisiana Power and Light awarded its $25‐million A‐rated bond issue to a syndicate led by Salomon Brothers, Eastman Dillon and Equitable Securities after it submitted a bid resulting in a borrowing cost to the Middle South Utilities subsidiary of 7.8073 per cent. The bonds were then offered publicly as 7⅞'s at 102 per cent of their face value to yield 7.70 per cent to maturity in 2001. The $7.5‐million “pot” set aside for orders to the group as a whole was reported all sold, and the issue unofficially was said to be more than 50 per cent sold. Louisiana Power and Light also sold $10‐million of preferred stock. Salomon Brothers, Lehman Brothers and Smith, Barney formed a three‐member account and offered the stock with a 7.84 per cent dividend rate and a price of $101.818 to yield 7.70 per cent. This part of the utility's financing was reported two‐thirds sold. A railroad’ equipment trust certificate sale showed that short‐term rates moved substantially higher in the last week. In the sale, the Union Pacific awarded $12‐million of Aaa certificates to a First Boston‐Halsey, Stuart‐F. I. duPont, Glore Forgan group, which priced them to yield from 4.50 per cent in 1972 to 7.10 per cent in 1986. A week ago, the Denver & Rio Grande Western sold another top‐quality certificate issue that was scaled from 4.15 to 7.10. Interlake, Inc., meanwhile, registered with the S.E.C. $60‐million of 25‐year debentures to be sold late this month by a Kuhn Loeb syndicate. Interlake is a diversified Chicagobased company in seven businesses, ranging from packaging to steel to home furnishings. United Jersey Banks, a five‐bank holding company in New Jersey and the second largest in the state, filed $20‐million of 25‐year debentures. Merrill Lynch, Hornblower & Weeks and W. E. Hutton will co‐manage the offering.

Mr. Avasso resigned recently as a vice president and director of Burton, Dana, Westerlund, Inc., a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange. Whitney North Seymour Jr., United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the indictment charged that Mr. Avasso took two $100,000 United States Treasury bills to Geneva, knowing that the bills had been obtained illegally. The defendant will be arraigned on Monday. The lawyer for Mr. Avasso said that his client was innocent of the charges.

172-> W. R. Grace Expects Drop Of 10c a Share for Quarter
J. Peter Grace, chairman and chief executive of W. R. Grace & Co. estimated yesterday that first‐quarter earnings would be about 10 cents less than the 35 cents a share reported for the 1970 period. Addressing the New York Society of Security Analysts, Mr. Grace added that earnings for the year would show a “modest increase.” This projection, he stated, was based on a budget assuming lower first‐quarter results. In the first quarter last year, W. R. Grace had a net income of $7.6‐million. Income for the year before extraordinary items was $51‐million, or $1.96 share, and $30.2‐million, or $1.12 a share after extraordinary items.

173-> SENATORS ASSAIL RAILPAX SYSTEM
WASHINGTON, April 6 (UPI)—Some Senators threatened today to take away the Federal subsidy from the new National Railroad Passenger Corporation unless rail service through their states was restored. Officials of the corporation, known as Railpax, told the Senators that the $340‐million subsidy would be exhausted quickly if sparsely populated areas had to be served at a loss. The Senators demanded restoration of services to Arkansas, New Hampshire, Maine, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming, which were left out of the, Railpax system. The Senators contended that if their citizens were being taxed to help support passenger lines, they had the right to demand service. Senator Gale McGee, Democrat of Wyoming, urged the Senate Appropriations Committee to take the $40‐million subsidy away from Railpax until Wyoming's only passenger train, which runs from Cheyenne to Omaha, is put back in service. The Senate Democratic leader, Mike Mansfield of Montana, called the planned passenger network of 184 trains — 100 fewer than are now running—“totally inadequate” and accused the Administration of misleading the nation about what Railpax would mean. “If Railpax isn't interested in starting off on the right foot, perhaps it would be best to withdraw all funds already appropriated so that [it] will not be able to operate after May 1,” Senator Mansfield said. Meanwhile, local officials were pleading for a similar Federal subsidy to keep mass transit systems running in the cities. Mayor Sam Massell of Atlanta, Gov. Francis W. Sargent of Massachusetts and representatives of the American Transit Association urged support for a $150‐million Federal subsidy. “I am absolutely convinced that unless mass transportation systems are subsidized, the fares will surely price them out of existence,” Mayor Massell told a Senate urban affairs subcommittee. Railpax was created last year to take Over passenger, trains from companies that no longer wanted to run them and create a new, integrated nationwide system at the end of this month. The corporation was given a $40‐million direct Federal grant and backing for $300‐million in revenue bonds, which the taxpayers will have to make good in the event Railpax loses money. Senator Robert Taft Jr., Republican of Ohio, said he would introduce legislation next week to add Cleveland, Toledo, Youngstown and Akron to the Railpax routes at a cost of $250‐million. In the House, 22 members proposed that $89.9 million more be provided Railpax so it could extend its northern eastwest routes.

174-> SUDANESE REPORT EXECUTION OF 4 WHO HELPED COUP
CAIRO, July 23 — Four of the leftist officers in the Su dan who ousted Premier Gaa far al‐Nimeiry Monday and in turn were overthrown yester day were executed by a firing squad in Khartoum today, the official Sudanese radio report ed. The officers were identified as Maj. Hashem al‐Ata, who led the military attack Monday and became deputy leader of the short‐lived leftist regime; Col. Abdel Moneim Ahmed, commander of the Third Ar mored Brigade; Lieut. Col. Osman Hussein, commander of the Republican Guards, and Capt. Muaweya Abdel Hal, one of the seven‐member Revolu tionary Command Council set up after the overthrow of Gen eral Nimeiry. Two other members of the council, Lieut. Col. Bubakr al Nur Osman and Maj. Farouk Osman Hamadallah, were re moved from a British airliner yesterday at Benghazi, Libya, while en route from London to the Sudan. The Libyan press agency re ported that Colonel al‐Nur Osman, head of the seven‐man council, left for Khartoum this morning. It did not say that the trip was voluntary. With the Sudan in a state of emergency and under curfew, General Nimeiry organized four military tribunals to try what he described last night as the renegades who deposed him. The Sudanese radio said that he had approved the death sentences imposed on the four officers by a court‐martial. [The Associated Press, in a dispatch from Cairo, quoted Col. Mounir Hammad, identi fied as an aide to General Nimeiry, as having said that the four officers had not been executed. The agency said this was his comment on be ing told over the telephone that the Sudanese radio was announcing that the death sentences had been carried out.] Newspapers in Arab capitals acclaimed the recovery of pow er by General Nimeiry, an Arab Socialist and a friend of Egypt, from what was feared —and appeared—to be a Com munist‐oriented military faction. The Kuwaiti newspaper Al rai al Amm, for example, ex pressed satisfaction over the “brevity of the dream of the Communists, whose rule lasted for just three days.” The only Arab country that voiced support for the coup d'èat in the Sudan was Iraq, whose Baath party Government is ultraleftist. President Hafez al‐Assad of Syria sent a message of con gratulations to Premier Ni meiry, condemning the leaders of the coup as “deluded and deceitful.” Sudanese airports remained closed today and the primary source of information about de velopments in the country, the largest in Africa, was the Su danese Government's official Omdurman radio. When the countercoup oc curred yesterday afternoon, the broadcasting center was evi dently one of the primary ob jectives. Major Ata has been on the air repeatedly to appeal to the people to rush into the streets in support of the anti‐Nimeiry Government against foreign in tervention. Shortly before 7 P.M., the pro‐Nimeiry forces captured the station and broad cast that General Nimeiry had been rescued from his captors and was back in power. A few hours later the Pre mier went on the air to con demn the “mean conspiracy” against him. He called on the Sudanese people to seize the conspirators and their support ers and turn them over to the police or army. In a telephone conversation with the correspondent of the Cairo radio, General Nimeiry said today that about 30 of the soldiers and officers loyal to him had been killed during the fighting. He said that the hospitals of Khartoum were full of wounded loyalists and added that the hunt for Communists in the country—whom he de scribed as traitors—was being intensified. Opposition from the strong Communist movement had trou bled General Nimeiry ever since he seized power in the Sudan in May, 1969. The Communists objected in particular to the Premier's as pirations to link the Sudan with Egypt, Libya and Syria in federation. Premier Nimeiry's triumph over his opponents yesterday appears to improve his chances for joining the federation. It is scheduled to take effect after plebiscites to be held on Sept. 1.

175-> National League
From Florida to California, baseball training camps will sprout in the next few days and, as the National League National League prepares for its 96th season, free‐for‐alls loom in both the Eastern and Western Divisions. All 12 managers who finished 1970 will be on the scene in 1971, which is rare enough in the high‐risk business of pro fessional sports. One new ball park will open—Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. And one towering personality, Richie Allen, has changed sides from the St. Louis Car dinals to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Absent from the scene is the burning question of a year ago: Can the New York Mets repeat their magic? They didn't. The Pittsburgh Pirates, with only 89 victories and a mild .549 playing percentage, won the Eastern championship with the Chicago Cubs taking second place from the Mets in a photo finish. The Cincinnati Reds, with 102 victories in 162 games, swept the West and then swept the Pirates for the pennant. The 12 managers in the league range from George (Sparky) Anderson of Cincin nati, a winner in his rookie season, to Walter Alston of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the senior skipper in baseball, who is start ing his 18th year. Between them, Anderson and Alston seem to hold most of the high cards, at least in the West. The Reds stormed ahead last season, then coasted home by 14½ games despite a crippled pitching staff that lost the World Series in five games to the Baltimore Orioles. This time, they have lost Bobby Tolan, their center fielder, because of a basketball injury, their pitching health is still unknown—and Alston has help. In the East, the scenario and the cast may be twice as complex. The Pirates, Cubs, Mets and Cardinals all are rated con tenders again, and this spring the burning question may be: Can the Mets recover their magic? “Their attitude is better than it was a year ago,” said Bob Scheffing, who became general manager a year ago while the Mets were still taking bows and making money. “They're in better physical shape, too, without all that winter‐time commotion. In fact, I've spoken to only one player who was overweight, and he was only five pounds over. “But everybody is hungry in the East, and whoever plays best at the end of the race will win it.” As for the Mets, who did not play best at the end of 1970, their chief worries are Tommie Agee's knee, Tom Seaver's “tired” right arm and Jerry Koosman's sore left arm. The two pitchers won only 30 games between them last season, a dozen fewer than in 1969. Their leading home‐run hit ter, Donn Clendenon, will be 36 years old in July. To win, the Mets would have to get more hitting from Cleon Jones, more pitching from those strong young arms of 1969, more strength from the bull pen and more harmony from a team that began to bicker. If the cartilage in Agee's knee is not mended, they also will need a center fielder. If Wayne Garrett is called by the Army, they also will need a third baseman, and if Bob Aspromonte cannot take up the slack, then they will need a rookie star. The rookies in camp, in fact, may have their best shots at jobs since the days when the Mets had more jobs than people to fill them. The chief applicants are Tim Foli, who played third base and shortstop at Tidewater of the International League; Ted Martinez, who hit .330 in the Dominican Republic this winter and who plays any where in the infield; Jon Matlack, a left handed pitcher from Tidewater, and Leroy Stanton, an outfielder who hit .303 with 19 home runs at Tidewater. They also have Ken Singleton, the switch‐hitting outfielder, who was called up in June and hit well until August, when he pulled a leg muscle. Following is a report on the other teams in the National League National League and the order in which they finished in 1970: Like the Reds in the West, the Pirates closed with sore arms, and still aren't cer tain they healed. The casualties were Bob Moose, Dock Ellis and Bob Veale and, this winter in Puerto Rico, Fred Cambria joined the list. However, they have been shopping for reinforcements. They got Bob Johnson, an ex‐Met, from Kansas City (for Freddie Patek) and Nelson Briles, an ex‐winner, from St. Louis (for Matty Alou). The leading winner on the staff last year was Luke Walker, with 15 victories. But the pitching was backed by bats that hit .270 with 130 home runs, and the bats could be even stronger now. Al Oliver, who batted in 83 runs, may switch from first base to Alou's spot in center field; Bob Robertson, who hit 27 home runs, but is a risky fielder, would go to first base, and Rich Hebner, a .290 hitter, would take his natural spot at third base. Manny Sanguillen, a .325 hitter, may help rest Roberto Clemente, a .352 hitter, in right field while Milt May tries to make as the catcher. Age could be a decisive factor with Leo Durocher's team, which has developed power—but not staying power—the last two seasons. Ernie Banks is turning 40, and Ron Santo, Jim Hickman and even Joe Pepitone are turning 31. Phil Regan, the best in the bull pen, is 34. Randy Hundley, the catcher, sat out half of 1970 with a broken hand. This is a team that hit 179 home runs, one‐third more than the Mets. But it's a team that's never had five starting pitchers. The best are Ken Holtzman, Ferguson Jenkins and Bill Hands. After that, Milt Pappas and Jim Colborn pose question marks. Regan, who allowed almost five runs every nine innings, is still the “stopper” of a doubtful bull pen. Hoyt Wilhelm, at 47, has been returned to Atlanta after a three‐ week September “loan.” More speed, less power, problematic pitching, no Richie Allen. It's a new look for Bing Devine and Manager Red Schoen dienst. The new look includes Ted Sizemore at second base and Matty Alou in center, with Joe Torre probably going to third base, Ted Simmons catching, Joe Hague at first and Lou Brock solid in left field. However, Allen's bat has gone west, Julian Javier is suffering from tax troubles and creeping age, and Mike Shannon has been sidetracked to the front office by kidney ailment. The chief concern is: after Bob Gibson pitches, what happens? The key may be Steve Carlton, who lost 19 games last season in a startling reverse. Injuries made an ordeal of Frank Luc chesi's first year as manager. He lost both catchers, Tim McCarver and Mike Ryan, in the same game; Don Money, his third‐base man, was out a month; John Briggs, the left fielder, had a sore arm and Larry Hisle, the center fielder, had various ailments. Also, Chris Short, the best pitcher, was in jured but now is reported sound. Tony Taylor, at 35, may be the most use ful man in camp. But the club lacks power, with only Deron Johnson and Money as major threats, though the Phillies traded Grant Jackson to Baltimore for Roger Fried, the minor league “player of the year” at Rochester. The ranking pitchers are Short, who is 33, and Jim Bunning, who is 39. Behind them, Rick Wise and a good bull pen featuring Dick Selma, Joe Hoerner, Barry Lersch and Woody Fryman. They made no significant trades, except for getting Ron Hunt from San Francisco in a mystery exchange for Dave McDonald. One suspicion is that Hunt, a rough‐house at second base, may be injured. Otherwise, the team, which almost made it to fifth place last year, has power but lacks speed. Rusty Staub hit 30 home runs, Bob Bailey 28, Ron Fairly and John Bateman 15 apiece and Mack Jones 19. But Carl Mor ton, with 18 victories as a rookie, and Steve Renko, with 13, were the only pitch ers who won more than seven games. No baseball team that has John Bench catching, Lee May at first base and Tony Perez at third base can be all wrong; not even a team that ended the season with Jim Merritt, Wayne Simpson and Jim Mc Glothlin ailing in an epidemic of sore arms and shoulders that advanced Gary Nolan from No. 4 pitcher to No. 1. As if that weren't bad enough, the Reds now have lost their center fielder, Bob Tolan. He ruptured an Achilles tendon while playing basketball, an activity that the management long had considered chancy. Now Manager Anderson will prob ably switch Pete Rose to center field and Hal McRae to right, with Bernie Carbo handling left field alone. As for the pitchers, nobody knows how they will recover, especially Simpson. More may depend on the youngsters Milt Wilcox and Don Gullett. A deep team, perhaps vulnerable to a challenge, but a team that hit 191 home runs with four .300 hitters, so shed no tears yet for the Big Red Machine. If anybody can topple Cincinnati, it is widely believed that the Dodgers can, after a winter of acquiring new muscles. Bill Grabarkewitz led the team with only 17 home runs last season, but in major trades the Dodgers got Richie Allen, who hit 34 at St. Louis, and Duke Sims, who hit 23 at Cleveland. Manager Alston now has three left handed‐hitting catchers in Sims, Bill Suda kis and Tom Haller; Wes Parker, the only man in the league who played in all 162 games, at first base; Jim Lefebvre, Maury Wills or Grabarkewitz at second to replace Ted Sizemore; any one of those three or Bill Russell at third base, and either Wills or the rookie Bob Valentine at shortstop. In the outfield, Allen in left, Willie Davis center and either Willie Crawford or Manny Mota in, right. The class pitchers still are Bill Singer, recovered from hepatitis; Don Sutton and Claude Osteen, with Jim Brewer and Pete Mikkelsen heading the bull pen. Al Down ing, just obtained from Milwaukee for Andy Kosco, could become the other left‐handed starter the Dodgers have wanted. They finished only 1½ games behind the Dodgers and for the last six weeks out played even Cincinnati. Still weak in pitching, though Juan Marichal should he healthy after a summer of problems caused by a bad penicillin reaction. Gaylord Perry won 23 games, but after the top two, they have only Frank Reberger and Rich Robert son—and no left‐handed starter. In the bull pen, only Don McMahon, who is 40. The big question may be Willie Mc Covey's health. He hit 39 home runs with 123 runs batted in, but medication for arthritis in the knee caused an eyesight problem. The rest of the infield is chaotic, too, especially with Jim Ray Hart's bad shoulder still in doubt. The outfield is professional, with Bobby Bonds (26 homers, 48 stolen bases), Ken Henderson (17 homers, 88 runs batted in) and Willie Mays (28 homers and a career total of 628, with birthday No. 40 in sight May 6). Disappointing year in 1970 with 79 vic tories, 83 defeats, and Don Wilson hurting with a sore arm. The No. 2 pitcher, Larry Dierker, won 16 games but had heavy military commitments. The big bats belong to Doug Rader, Joe Morgan, Denis Menke and Jim Wynn, who hit 73 home runs combined. They may get support from Oscar Cedena, a young out fielder who hit .310 on a part‐time‐basis, and Roger Metzger, obtained from the Cubs, who could make it at shortstop. Dived from first place in the West to fifth place in one season, despite all that power. Now, to add to woes, Rico Carty severely injured his knee in a collision while playing winter ball in the Caribbean —and he led the majors with a .366 aver age plus 25 home runs. Cecil Upshaw, who cut his fingers in an accident and didn't pitch one inning last season, is back. But the staff is still peopled by Ron Reed, Phil Niekro, George Stone and Pat Jarvis, who accounted for only 46 victories. Felix Milian at second is solid and may team with young Marty Perez, a shortstop acquired from the California Angels. The outfield has lost Tony Gon zalez, but still has Mike Lum, Oscar Brown and Henry Aaron, who hit 38 home runs at the age of 35 and is still going strong. They won 52 games as rookies in the league in 1969 and 63 games in 1970, depending largely on young players both years. The feeling is they are on the right track: good power, fair pitching, maturing defense—all under a sound manager, Pres ton Gomez. Nate Colbert hit 38 home runs, Clarence Gaston 29, Ollie Brown 23 and Al Ferrara 13. Team as a whole hit 172, and only Cincinnati and Chicago hit more in the league. The Padres traded a 14‐game winner, Pat Dobson, to the Orioles with Tom Dukes but in return acquired four players who could help: Tom Phoebus, Fred Beene and Al Severinsen, all pitchers, and Enzo Fer nandez, an infielder.

Your fine articles on the current surge and interest in backpacking and on the Ap palachian Trail (Travel sec tion, May 9) prompt me to call attention to a conserva tion crisis problem threaten ing the trail. The A.T. is con tinually being menaced by uncontrolled development in various forms. To THE EDITOR: The latest invasion involves the ski development planned to be constructed on former farm lands intended (but not yet acquired) by the Federal Government for inclusion in the Delaware Water Gap Na tional Recreation Area. The proposed development would be on Kittatinry Mountain on the southeast side of Flat brook Valley, opposite the village of Wallpack Center, in Sussex County, New Jer sey. The 800 or so acres the developer intends to acquire is classified in the National Park Service's master plan for the recreation area as primitive, to be preserved as predominately wild wooded area. Not only does the scheme seriously upset the park service plan, the devel opment would destroy a sec tion of the Appalachian Trail on top of the mountain, along which it runs for about 41 miles from the Water Gap to High Point. The largest remaining mountaintop swamp eco‐system in the recreation area would be de stroyed, and a prominent, scenic, wooded mountain side would be permanently spoiled The New York‐New Jersey Trail Conference, composed of about 35 member clubs, is seriously concerned about the ski development both as to its effects on the recrea tion area and on the A.T. (The conference is respon sible for maintaining about 170 miles of the trail in New York and New Jersey members of conference clubs clear, mark and report on the condition of the trail and the shelters.) Action is needed to stop the ski devel opment so that the plan for the entire recreation area can be fulfilled and to pre vent rerouting and damage to the trail. JOHN A.

177-> Dr. Allen Brandt, a Specialist In Industrial Hygiene, Is Dead
BETHLEHEM, Pa., Oct. 2—Dr. Allen D. Brandt, executive counselor on environmental quality to the industrial relations department of the Bethlehem Steel Company, died today in St. Luke's Hospital. He was 63 years old. Surviving are his widow, the former Ella Snavely; a son, Frederick; a daughter, Mrs. Patricia Cochran; a brother, a sister and two grandchildren. Dr. Brandt spent virtually his entire career in the field of industrial hygiene, a discipline that only, recently has come into national prominence. He spent the years 1933 to 1940 as director of industrial hygiene research at Willson Products, Inc., Reading, Pa., and then joined the Public Health Service in Washington as chief of the engineering section of the industrial hygiene division. From 1942 to 1945, Dr. Brandt was assistant chief of the industrial hygiene branch of the safety and security division of the Office of the Chief of Ordnance of the War Department. The Public Health Service then assigned him, as a research fellow, to the research laboratory of the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers in Cleveland. In 1946, Dr. Brandt joined Bethlehem Steel as chief of the industrial hygiene department, and in 1967 his title became manager of environmental quality control. Born in Mountville, Pa., on March 8, 1908, Dr. Brandt obtained a B.S. degree in civil engineering from Pennsylvania State College in 1931. Harvard gave him an M.S. in sanitary engineering in 1932 and a D.Sc. in 1933. He added a B.S. in law from La Salle Extension University in 1954.

179-> Kosygin Gets an Air View of the Prairies of Canada
EDMONTON, Alberta, Oct. 24—Premier Aleksei Ni Kosy gin of the Soviet Union trav eled by plane today across “the prairies, a part of Canada that is highly disturbed by Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau's recent overtures of friendship toward the Soviet Union. In Edmonton, his only stop on a flight from Vancouver to Toronto. Mr. Kosygin was in center of those who accuse the Soviet Government of oppress ing Ukrainians, Hungarians, Czechs, Latvians, and even Russians. Ukrainians are the largest single ethnic minority in Edmonton. There are 40,000 of them in the city, whose pop ulation is 350,000. Unusual security precautions, prompted by hostile demonstra tions elsewhere since Mr. Kosy gin's arrival in Canada a week ago, discouraged most Edmon tonians from greeting their vis itor. Only about 100 people awaited his arrival at a down town hotel. Most of the four‐hour stop over here was taken up by visit to the Sherritt‐Gordon Nickel Mine refinery at Fort Saskatchewan, 20 miles north east of Edmonton. This visit, Canadian officials said, was to satisfy Mr. Kosygin's special interest in Canadian metallurgy techniques. Mayor Ivor Dent of Edmon ton told Mr. Kosygin that he was being presented with a Canadian musk ox, to be shipped to Moscow “on behalf of the children of Edmonton to the children of Moscow.”

187-> Malaga: Beaches, Bulls and Pablo, Too
MALAGA, Spain—This bustling Mediterranean port—the Ma laca of the first century B.C. ists who pass through here mainly as the gateway to the sea and sun of Spain's Costa del Sol. All year long, va cationers arrive here by land, sea and air and immediately buzz off for Tor remolinos, Fuengirola, Marbella or any one of dozens of other resorts that line this coast 65 miles northeast of Gibral tar and facing North Africa. Those who tarry here even for a day or two, how ever, discover that Malaga has some resort tricks of its own and is well worth the stopover. Besides soaking up the sun on the beach, visitors here can tour one of the nearby bull‐breeding ranches and ride with the. Spanish “cowboys,” take an eight‐mile excursion to Ronda, one of Spain's most picturesque old towns, visit a local winery and sample the wares or journey to nearby Nerja to see cave paintings 20,000 years old. They can also visit the museums and see many works by a famous local boy —Pablo Picasso. The city of 326,000 lies at the foot of a mountain, El Gibralfaro (the lighthouse of Jebel, or the lighthouse on the moun tain), and from the castle and fortress on its summit, you get one of the most magnificent views in the world. Below, lies Malaga, with its fine sand beaches, the hay, with all types of shipping mov ing in and out, the blue Mediterranean and, beyond, Gibraltar and Morocco. In days gone by, Phoenicians, Ro mans and Moorish sentinels successive ly stood on the summit watching for the approach of enemies by land or sea, but today's visitors simply savor the view, picking out one beauty spot after another. Directly below is the bullring, then the shield‐shaped Puerto Oscura formal gardens in front of the City Hall. Three long, thick lines of trees in dicate the Municipal Park and its love ly promenades, and the large fountain in the triangle of the Plaza Queipo de Llano pinpoints the metropolitan center of Malaga, with its luxury hotels and main shopping streets. All the important landmarks of the city, including its oth er mighty fortress, the Alcabaza, which stands on another high point, can be seen clearly. Unlike the Alcabaza, which has been preserved and restored with money from both private and Government sources, the Gibralfaro ruins are unattended. There are no admission charges and no guides (except an occasional self‐ap pointed one generally in the person of an ambitious but uninformed urchin). One reaches the Gibralfard ruins by driving the short distance from the city center or taking a taxi (at extra fare because, say the drivers, the steep road is so hard on their cars) to the rem nant of the outer wall where the road stops. There is also a narrow, precipi tous footpath from the small Govern ment purador, or inn, a short distance from the top. The parador, incidentally, is a favorite luncheon spot with the knowing visitor, not particularly for the food which nevertheless is quite good authentic local fare but for the view from its dining balcony. The castle and fortress are believed to have been built originally by the Phoenicians. When Andalusia was under Moorish domination in the 14th cen tury, the stronghold was greatly en larged by King Yusif I and became the almost‐impregnable citadel, El Jebal faro. One of the final conquests in Fer dinand and Isabella's drive to push the Moors out of Spain, it was captured by the Spanish in 1489, after 40 days of fierce fighting and heavy losses on both sides. Once inside the fortress walls or Las Ruinas, one can wander around at lei sure drinking in the vistas and exam ining the watchtower, sentinels' walks, cisterns, walls of dungeons, with chains still attached, and stairs that wind and twist and finally lead, like those in a surrealist painting, to high, giddy, open spaces. Visiting the other important Moorish fortress‐castle, the Alcabaza, is a far less casual activity. As with other na tional monuments and museums, there are fixed visiting hours and an admis sion charge of 15 pesetas (about a quar ter), which includes the Archeological Museum, now connected with the Al cabaza and most worthwhile. The Arab word alcabaza means a fortress within a walled enclosure, and this one—the pride of Malaga—has not only been preserved and restored as to structure but has beautiful gardens and fountains simulating those that graced it when it was a stronghold of the wa ter‐loving Moors. It is advisable to make use of the services of one of the uniformed guides here, as it is somewhat difficult to find one's way through all the passageways of the battlements, towers, harem and palace rooms. And, unless one has am ple time for repeated visits, many of the items in the Archeological Muse um may prove meaningless. During the recent restoration of the Alcabaza, a huge Roman theater was excavated, indicating the importance of Malaga during the long Roman occu pation. Although the Ministry of Tour ism will not formally open this part of the Alcabaza national monument to the public until the theater has been com pletely uncovered, a friendly guide can, as mine did, gain access to the re construction, so that you can see the circle of seats emerging from the dust. At present, the best‐preserved Roman theater in Spain is at Ronda (known as Acinpo in Roman times), and al though this is much smaller than the newly discovered Malaga ruins, it considered such a gem of Roman archi tecture that almost as many tourists travel from Malaga to see Ronda's theater as to see its bullring, said to be the oldest in Spain. Ronda, of course, is famous for its bullfights, and there is nothing to com pare with seeing a corrida in this old Goyesque setting. However, Malaga it self draws the celebrated matadors for its fiesta—running from Aug. 27 for about 10 days—and throngs of vaca tioners from the nearby resorts on the Spanish Sun Coast flock into town for the festivities. Few of the aficionados, however, take advantage of another opportunity offered to those interested in the fight ing bulls—that of visiting a cortijo, a rearing and training ground. Not far from Malaga are such ranches as Concha y Sierra (Shell and Mountain Range) and Cortijo de Domeco (Breeding Farm of Domeco), as well as many smaller ones. One tourist agency in Malaga offers a day‐long excursion to a breeding ranch, where one can hire a horse and, in groups of five to 10, ride with the trainers. Hundreds of bulls roam the grasslands and display none of the fe rocity in groups that they exhibit singly in the ring. One also can see the yards where. Bulls are chosen for the ring and watch the rookie matadors, or no villeros working out. A visit to one of the local wineries can be arranged for groups through tourist agency, but the largest and best known house, Bodegas Scholtz Herma nos. Welcomes individual visitors. Malaga, a favorite “sweet” wine with the British since the 17th century, made differently from other wines: Its particular process does not require that the grapes be pressed soon after har vesting. They are left to dry in the warm Andalusian sun until they become raisins and are set to ferment, Another difference is that unlike other dessert wines, no sugar or other fruits, such as figs. Are added—only the natural Ma laga grapes are used. A visit to the bodegus is highlighted by the tasting session, in which dozens of brands of Malaga, ranging from al most dry to very sweet, can be sam pled. Along with the brandies that are distilled from them. A visit to Spain is not complete one has not experienced a good fla menco performance, with its fiery danc ing, accompanied by zapateado (heel tapping), castanets, guitars and stac cato handelapping; and its wailing, fre quently wordless songs which reflect Arabic and Oriental influences. Since Malaga is the capital of Andalusia, and Andalusia is the birthplace of flamenco, the nightlife—even much daytime life, particularly during fiesta time—re volves amend the flamenco songs and dances. Even the name of the best known type of this singing and dancing, mulaguenos, is named after, the city. Typical also of Malaga are the ver diules, fandangos and serranas, the lat ter very difficult songs with sudden rises and changes of pitch, frequently sung unaccompanied or to only an oc casional deep guitar chord. Of course, one can enjoy flamenco, pure or diluted, In any Spanish town big enough to have a night spot, but in Malaga, still permeated by life and culture of the people of the mountain areas which surround it, there is a bet ter chance of seeing a fresh, sponta neous performance than a sophisticated, slick one. Within short driving distance of Ma laga are many small towns and vil lages of interest, including Ronda, the ancient city of Celtic origin previously mentioned for its well‐preserved Roman theater and bullring. Ronda sits astride a spectacular gorge, 250 feet deep, through which the River Guadelvin flows, crossed by three bridges, Roman, Arab and modern Spanish. Adra, a fishing port near the Albu feras, or lagoons, on which the black duck nests, attracts sportsmen from many parts of Europe for the shooting. The town is also near the Sierra Ne vada and Alpujarras, mountains which offer good skiing in winter. From Sept. 6 to 10, the Fiestas of Our Lady of the Sea and St. Nicholas of Tolentino are held at Adra. Almunecar, which as Sexi was a Roman town in 200 B. C., has an aque duct and other ruins dating from those times. There also are splendid remnants of the Muslim occupation of Spain, since Almunecar was one of the Moors' last strongholds before Ferdinand and Isabella drove the invaders back to Africa. There is a large castle harbor ing Cueva de los Palacios (the Palace Cave), where the Moorish kings of Gra nada kept their treasure. Although the town is known by its Arabic name, Almunecar, the Roman proper name, Sexi, is most often used by the townsmen. It is also the name of the main street, Avenida Sexi, as well as one of the two leading hotels and its pronunciation provokes a good deal of merriment and many bad jokes among English‐speaking visitors. When this writer was a student at the Uni versity of Granada some years back, our class in Moorish culture was lodged in the Hotel Sexi while we studied the town's architecture and archeology. Needless to say, pilferage of glasses, silver, linen and stationery bearing the name Sexi was extraordinarily high. Estepona is another town of Roman origin in the area. Although it is mostly a typical old‐fashioned Andalusian fish ing village, it has a modern yacht club with boats and equipment for hire for underwater and game fishing. Fiesta week here begins June 24. At San Roque are the ruins of Car teya which, according to Strahon, was the first Roman colony on the penin sula. There is also an important bull ring, much favored by sonic of the cele brated matadors, as well as a camp ground near the good sand beaches. Fiestas are held all during July. Also close to Malaga is Nerja, the site of recently discovered caves whose upper galleries contain mural paintings which, like the more famous ones at Altamira in northern Spain, date back some 20,000 years. The Nerja discovery was made in 1959 by five boys from the fishing vil lage of Maro nearby. Shortly after, as the importance of the find was recog nized, the Spanish Government began the complete excavation of the vast un derground chambers and construction of the cement paths, balconies, stairs and lighting which make it possible to visit all its galleries.

188-> W. VA. OUTSCORES E. CAROLINA 44‐21
MORGANTOWN, W. Va., Oct. 16 (UPI)—Pete Wood, a full back, scored three touchdowns and Brian Chiles, his relief man, tallied twice, as West Virginia capitalized on East Carolina's offensive mistakes today and defeated the Pirates, 44‐21. The West Virginia defense intercepted four passes to set up one of Wood's touchdowns and both of Chiles's scores. Wood scored in the first pe riod on a three‐yard scamper, plunged one yard for a touch down in the second period and rambled 35 yards for a score in the third period. Chiles, who came into the game to spell Wood, burst through the East Carolina de fense for a 25‐yard touchdown run in the third period and plunged one yard for a fourth quarter score. The quarterback, Bernie Ga liffa, passed 29 yards to end Dave Jagdmann for a touch down in the fourth quarter, and Frank Nester kicked a 26‐yard field goal in the first period to wrap up the Mountaineers’ scoring. Carl Summerell scored East Carolina's first touchdown on a one‐yard keeper in the third quarter. In the fourth period, a running back, Bill Wallace, scored on a 10‐yard run after West Virginia's Leon Jenkins fumbled a punt return on the East Carolina 38. John Casazza passed 44 yards to his flanker, Tim Dameron, for the Pirates’ final touchdown ??

189-> Baltimore Suburb Is Afflicted With Growing Pains
TOWSON, Md. — Towson may be the fastest‐growing state of mind in the nation. May be. Nobody knows for sure, because nobody knows exactly what Towson is. Or where it begins, or where it ends. Towson, which was once a dozing village of good farm land and rolling estates in the wooded green hills just north of Baltimore, has been the seat of Baltimore County since 1854. Towson Town, it has been called. But it is not a town and it is not a city. In the 610 square miles of Baltimore County that ring the decay ing city of Baltimore like a well‐pitched horseshoe on a stake, there are no incomora ted municipalities, no local governments. The County Ex ecutive and the seven‐mem ber County Council govern the area as if it were a city outside the city. How big is Towson, the new green dream land where Spiro T. Agnew once lived and ruled as County Execu tive? Some officials, planners and residents say 70,000, some say 80,000, some say 100,000. And everybody says, “It depends what you count.” How much has it grown? From about 3,700 in the mid dle nineteen‐forties—with the the same repeated disclaim er. What most people count is a swarth of countryside about four and a half miles long and three miles deep, bounded on the south by the city line and on the north by the Baltimore Beltway, that strip of concrete that has been credited with—or ac cused of—fathering much of Towson's recent develop ment, And most agree that that would put Towson's pop ulation at about 80,000. Still, for all its 830,000 to $100,000 homes, its town houses, its duplexes, its sprawling shopping centers, its new office buildings and luxury apartments rising amid the yammer of riveters over the squat, cramped old business district on York Road, Towson is just a state of mind. It is also the full flowering of the mass migration after World War II that the 1970 census found had made sub urbia predominant in Amer ica with 75 million residents —almost none of them black. And it is the racial ambi valence— or sometime the outright antagonism — that has accompanied that great out‐migration, a factor im plicit in a Supreme Court case last week in which the Court upheld state referen dum laws that permit a majority in a community to block construction of low rent housing for the poor. Construction of housing for the poor, particularly the poor and the black, is one of Towson's deepest, touchiest issues. • “This used to be a nice lit tle town,” Walter E. Myers said wistfully, looking across his back yard a few hundred yards at the 14‐story Hamp ton Tower luxury apartment house and the fast‐rising, cir cular Hampton Plaza build ings, a 26‐story apartment house and 12‐story office building that will contain their own parking garage and a shopping center. Mr. Myers, a 51‐year‐old retired county policeman, is black. So are his neighbors in the 30‐odd shabby frame houses tucked among the trees in the tiny enclave known as East Towson, which now sits uneasily on some of the most valuable property in the land‐hungry county seat. A power station has al ready taken one bite out of East Towson. And a loop highway is scheduled to slice through it to ease the traffic pressure on crowded York Road. In the past, when blacks have been dislocated by developments, many of them have been forced to move out of the area, some of them into the slums of Balti‐more. Voters turned down an ur ban renewal plan for Towson in 1964, at least partly be cause it would have provided low‐income housing for those displaced, and neither the county nor private developers have shown any indications yet of being willing to take up the slack, (Less than 3 per cent of Baltimore County's population, or about 18,000 out of 620,000, is black.) “I don't have to have a mountain fall on me,” Mr. Myers continued. “she people here are on pins and needles. They told me we'd be safe here until '71. Well, it's '71 now.” He added: “I don't want to go to one of those row houses in Balti more city, where I walk out my front door and have to walk around the block to go in my back door. I want to be able to walk around my house.” Pointing at the, new apart ment buildings looming near by, he asked: “If I had to move and didn't want to go in the city, how could I afford one of those? My rent is $25 a week starting the first of May. When we moved here in '55, it was $15 a week; then it went up to $20 a Week.” Weighing the prospects of moving to the city, he said: “Most of the people have lived here all their lives and they can't stand that con crete.” • Behind his desk at the County Office Building, Dale Anderson, the outspoken County Executive who is in his second four‐year term, contemplated East Towson. “Part of it will be lost to condemnation,” he said, “but they have a promise that, as long as I'm in this chair, they won't put Towsontowne Bou levard [the loop highway] through there until we can provide housing for those people.” Mr. Anderson continued: “You call it low‐income, but it's not low‐cost housing. I don't know that those are low‐income people over there. Their average income is prob ably higher than other Negro families in the county. “But if they're moved out by Towsontowne Boulevard, they're going to have to have some place to live and as far as I'm concerned, they're not going to have to look for it in the city.” But the county has not yet come up with the money for resettlement housing and the loop highway remains stalled at the edges of East Towson. • Mario P. Doccolo, the slen der, energetic developer of the $22‐million Hampton Plaza project in East Towson, paced the floor of his penthouse of fice in the 14‐story Hampton Tower apartment building ($190 to $475 a month), which was completed five years ago. “It's a real skittish situ ation,” he said. “That's why that area isn't moving. To do anything you'd have to move people — somebody would have to move them—so they just let them sit.” “To replace them, you've got to replace what they live in,” Mr. Doccolo added. “You have the chance that their big brother in town might come out and beat the hell out of you. So they [the county] just cool it.” “Who's going to go in there and build this garden apart ment if somebody can't pay the rent?” he asked, his con stantly moving hands and shoulders as expressive as his words. “When the need gets that great that you have to do it —when we've used up what's good and there's nothing left —then somebody will do it. But we have no community problem here now and they want to leave it that way.” • But Mr. Doccolo has an other problem. He wants to build a hotel and department store across Joppa Road from Hampton Plaza, but he can't put the land together. Mrs. Hannah Stief Orth is stand ing in his way. Mrs. Orth is 83, frail, gray and perhaps a shade over five feet tail. But she bounces around the unfenced lawn and garden behind her mod est, gray‐shingled home across from the vast apart ment complex like a lively cricket. She has lived in her house with her tulips and hyacinths for 46 years. And she likes it just fine. “I've told them,” she said, her eyes bright behind her gold‐rimmed glasses, “if an other man comes down here I'm going to grab him by the seat of the pants and run him right out of here.” Looking up at the apart ment building, she added: “I wouldn't live in one of those. As long as I'm living, I'll be right here.” “All those beautiful homes that were over there were all torn down and Towson Cen ter is a mess,” she continued, “but I wouldn't move from Towson.” Then she nodded across her garden at the line of trees that blocks her view of East Towson and the people who share her sentiments. “The colored people who live hack in here,” she said, “I'd rather know them that some of the white people. I'll tell you why. One lawyer out here—and I wouldn't tell you his name—gave a color ed woman $500 for her little home and then he turned around and sold it when the power station came in and he got $35,000 for it. “I saw him later at a meet ing and I told him, ‘You're nothing but a thief and I'm not going to speak to you any more.’”

190-> Holy Jumping Geronimo! It's London Bridge!
LAKE HAVASU CITY, Ariz.—Here in America's Southwest, a hundred miles or so down the lower Colorado River from Hoover Dam, I am watching them put back together in the desert the London Bridge I saw being taken apart in England. Are they crazy? They're not even putting it across the Colorado River—the bulge in the river that is Lake Havasu is too wide at this point, So the bridge is going to span a waste of sand. Does Arizona really rather, contend it does. But not for the usual reason. “What we needed,” says Robert P. McCulloch, Sr., the founder of this resort and retirement community, “was a great drawing attraction for travelers and vacationers.” And so he decided to acquire something that had been made famous for generations by a nursery jingle—London Bridge. “We figure it will boost our two million tourist‐days a year to 10 mil lion,” he declares. It had better. It's costing $7 million to transfer it here from the River Thames, across which it was originally built in 1831 as the then‐latest in a line of London bridges dating back to the Roman conquest. If you're bothered, as I was, about the lack of even a trickle of water to lap its piers, in this new locale, be not concerned. The Arizona developers are digging a brand new river. It will sever the neck of a peninsula that sticks out into the lake and thus create an instant desert island—complete with sandy beaches. palm trees from Indio, Calif., and jet airport. They'll need a bridge to reach it. This is it. I am parked, along with other tourists, in the middle of the half‐bulldozed dry stream bed. Broadside before us stretch the five graceful arches conceived by John Rennie when he designed the bridge roughly a century and a half ago. In the British capital I would have had to take a Thames sightseeing cruise to get this view. Here I can step out of my car without getting my feet damp. But I do get sand in my shoes. When the bridge is completed in the fall—in time, assures the young British engineer in charge, for the ceremonial opening scheduled for Oct. 9–10, the Saturday and Sunday of the long Columbus Day holiday—dredges will finish scooping out 200,000 cubic yards of earth to let the swift Lake Havasu Colorado River current flow through. The new mile long scenic waterway even might be named the Little Thames, although that's not yet decided. In any event, it will be 600 feet across at its broadest and 18 feet deep, and this London Bridge (there's a new one a‐building in London) will then resume its job as a functional bridge. On the island‐to‐be, besides the airport, are one of Lake Havasu City's three modern motor inns (rates $14‐$18), a golf course, a 137‐acre public camp ground ($2.50 a car per night), one of two big trailer parks, a 260‐slip marina operated by a former South ern California ice cream tycoon and the racing pits for the world outboard championships run here each Thanksgiving. You get an idea of how the whole bridge area is going to look from an artist's conception repro duced on a giant billboard and on postcards—all cool blues and greens with the desert (sure, it gets hot I have mailed several postcards to skeptical friends who still won't believe London Bridge really is being moved here to the sands of Arizona. I even have bought a chip of the bridge glued to a square of orange pasteboard, price $1. And a blue and green bumper strip announcing: “London Bridge is going up at Lake Havasu City.” I've dined for a modest sum on English Pub ground steak and Lord Mayor of London lemon‐whip pie at the London Bridge Restaurant, which draws people from a hun dred miles around. I've climbed into one of two red double‐decker buses, its destination sign appropri ately rolled to “London Bridge,” and flicked dust off the hood of one of four shiny black London taxicabs, all brought over to keep the bridge com pany. And I've talked with the man who the bridge and who, I'm positive, never in his wildest dreams envisioned that road bearing his name—McCulloch Bou levard, Lake Havasu City's main drag — would one day run across London Bridge. Lake Havasu City was laid out only seven years ago by McCulloch, Los Angeles‐based industrialist (“You know, he makes chain saws”), an oilman and honorary Chemehuevi Indian chief (more about that later). Some World War II veterans may be familiar with this area. During the 1940's the United States Government laid down an auxiliary airport on this then ‐ isolated spot across the river‐lake from an Indian reservation in California, clustered barracks at the peninsula tip, cryptically designated Site 6 and sent servicemen needing rest and recuperation here on furloughs. was a great place to fish. In 1963, the Federal Government transferred the land‐12,990 acres—to the State of Arizona. The state sold at public auction to McCulloch for al most a million dollars. So McCulloch founded Lake Havasu City and its pres ent 8,000 settlers roomily scattered over 26 square miles are added to from every planeload of prospects flown in from Michigan or Illinois or Ohio by the Mc Culloch fleet of seven Electra airliners. Sixty‐one Canadians recently arrived from Toronto to inspect the $8,000‐$20, 000 third‐of‐an‐acre lots where you can build a sand‐hugging home free of lawn mowing and snow‐shoveling chores. Despite its name, Lake Havasu City technically isn't yet a city and is gov erned by the elected three‐man board of directors of the Lake Havasu Irriga tion and Drainage District, whose ap pointed general manager acts as “may or.” A former assistant attorney general of Arizona currently holds the job. Hy drants everywhere along the black topped streets curving among the sand hills help make life easy for the volun teer firemen. Mohave County sheriff's deputies are the law. The U.S. Post Of fice, in one of the two small green busi ness sections, is the first round U.S. Post Office in the nation. You can get here by car by driving 153 miles southeast from Las Vegas, 238 miles northwest from Phoenix or about 300 miles east from Los Angeles. A just‐opened final 19‐mile link of Ari zona Highway 95 up from Parker Dam has shortened the driving time from both L.A. and Phoenix by an hour. It was Parker Dam that 33 years ago, despite a protesting show of force by an armada of Arizona National Guards men, backed up the Colorado River to create 45‐mile‐long Lake Havasu (Indian for “blue water”) as a billion‐gallon‐a day reservoir for Los Angeles. The un availing show of force, incidentally, came because Arizona didn't want Cali fornia to get all the water, and today, surpisingly enough, though Lake Havasu City residents boat on the lake and fish in it, they still don't drink from it. In stead, they get their water from seven big artesian wells which supply so much that one of the motor inns even has waterfall flowing off the roof and you find ponds (I did) on 9 of the 18 fair ways of the public golf course where Ray Floyd, who won the Professional Golfers Association championship in 1969, is touring pro. If, instead of driving, you want to come by air, you can reserve a window seat—all 14 are—on Apache Airlines' little twin‐engine prop jet for $17 out of Las Vegas. It's a 50‐minute hop back across the Colorado into hour‐later Mountain Time and low over the some times bumpy reddish‐tan ridges. Let me reconstruct the trip as I experienced it. From Lake Mead we fly down past Lake Mohave, off to the right, for a quick descent to Kingman, long a tourist over night stop on Route 66, and now we swing over the Mohave Mountains and circle for a landing here in Lake Havasu City. Below, on the chunky neck between the town and the peninsula, I spy it— the long bridge low in the sand. Atop three flagpoles flutter the Stars and Stripes, the Union Jack, the colors of Arizona. As we bank, a fenced compound comes into view, with huge stones in neat rows as if removed from an ar cheological dig. But these stones weren't dug here. They've been brought about 10,000 miles—across the Atlantic, through the Panama Canal, up the Pacif ic Coast, then trucked over the desert to this place. Many ships were needed to bring the stones to the trucks, and just one of the many shipments re quired 60 trucks. Now we are touching down on one of the 7,000‐foot strips at the Lake Havasu City airport and presently I'm off to renew my acquaintance with Lon don Bridge. The last time I saw it was on a chill March afternoon in 1968 in London. was a month before it would be sold to make way for a much broader structure needed to carry today's growing traffic. Why not just widen it? Because engi neers said its piers, already sinking into the river bed at the rate of one inch every eight years, couldn't stand up un der the load of additional traffic lanes. A plaque outside Adelaide House at the City approaches to the span already recorded the start of the next bridge. That came with the removal of the first stone from the For Sale” one, on which demolition was already beginning when I saw it. To see it, I walked that day, crossing the Thames by Westminster Bridge, near the Houses of Parliament, and following the Albert Embankment and back streets past Waterloo, Blackfriars and Southwark Bridges. (The first Waterloo Bridge, with its nine stone arches, was regarded as Rennie's masterpiece and there was a great to‐do against its be ing taken down in 1934 to make way for the present Waterloo Bridge; the old Southwark Bridge, Rennie's other span across the Thames, was replaced in 1921.) I was ankle‐weary and cold when fi nally I reached the corner turning onto the Southwark end of London Bridge. But I forgot my discomfort at the sight. It looked a beautiful mess. On beyond historic Southwark Cathe dral, where in its parish church days Shakespeare stayed, a large red sign warned in white lettering: “London Bridge. Footway this side closed to pe destrians.” Derricks stuck up like gi raffes' necks along the upriver edge and a high board fence painted bright or ange shut off the sidewalk. That on the opposite curb had been widened double to handle the customary 20,000 pairs of feet each morning and evening rush hour. I joined the brisk stream up some stairs and down a ramp past a flower stand bright with daffodils and red car nations near a left‐over notice adver tising for snow‐removal workers. I was on London Bridge. Except for the graceful vase‐shaped balusters in the railing, there wasn't much to see of the bridge beyond a flat roadway busy with traffic. The arches were out of sight over the edge. The fixtures had been removed from the tops of the lampposts. Through a gap in the orange fence, however, I could glimpse St. Paul's dome, beneath which John Rennie was laid to rest before actual construction was begun on this bridge. (His son, Sir John Rennie, carried it out according to the elder Rennie's design.) In the other direction, downstream, loomed spectac ular Tower Bridge. It is said that many Americans at the time thought that was the one being sold. “London Bridge is a very sensible, dull bridge with simply a famous name,” a young press officer at the British Travel Association had told me that morning. I already had noticed, brow sing along the Green Park fence on Piccadilly, where artists offered their paintings, several representations of Tower Bridge, none of this. And, of course, it couldn't match its 600‐year‐old predecessor, a I2‐foot mod el of which I discovered in a downstairs alcove at the London Museum in Ken sington Palace. That London Bridge, dating to 1176 and until 1750 the only way to get across the Thames unless you took a boat, was crowded (between fires and until the final 75 years) all along its narrow 19‐piered length with overhanging houses and shops and pubs and a chapel where its priest‐architect was entombed, and at the south gate the heads of traitors were gorily im paled on tall poles, Anything would be dull after that. My thoughts come tumbling back to Arizona as I drive in my rented car ($14 a day plus 14 cents a mile) from the Lake Havasu City airport toward town, passing the turnoff where I'll check in later at my motel. A sign: Lake Havasu State Park. The developers had immedi ately reserved for the Federal Govern ment all the beaches, 22 miles of them, for leasing back to the state as park lands forever open to the public. Around a curve now and I see it. There, beyond a Chevron gasoline serv ice station (for esthetic reasons it's got to move) and an engineers' field office, is the bridge. I murmur under my breath: “You've come a long way, baby.” Off the blacktop that detours tempo rarily on around to the left, the wheels of the car sink into the sand. In Eng land this would be the Southwark end, the same by which I approached it over there in 1968, The whole construction area is sur rounded by a 6‐foot‐high chain‐link fence and a sign informs you: “London Bridge [in Old English lettering] Project. Only authorized personnel beyond this point.” But you don't have to go inside the fence to see the bridge. It's big—1,005 feet long according to Rennie's specifi cations, 952 feet says the billboard, and four lanes and two sidewalks wide. A broad swath has been smoothed through the sand outside the fence that spec tators may drive or walk along. It's exactly a mile around. I drive and am now parked in the dry stream bed. Up on the bridge floor, swirling gusts momentarily cause three workmen in yellow plastic helmets to avert their faces as they reach up to guide another heavy stone dangling from a red hoist. An ocean and a continent distant from the skyline it once shared with St. Paul's, the stone is let down slowly against a very different backdrop—a jagged horizon of bare mountains. The reaching hands push it into its numbered spot on the face of the prestressed con crete shell molded over a steel frame fabricated by a construction firm from Tucson. Bridge‐building has changed since the early 19th century. The bridge John Rennie designed and his son constructed was made of solid stone, 110,000 tons of it, quarried in Aberdeen and Devon and Cornwall. A force of 800 men toiled 7 years 5 months and 13 days to com plete it and 40 lives were lost, mostly to the fierce tidal currents of the Thames. Here the long superstructure, com posed of three‐abreast, end‐to‐end steel Are They Crazy? Yeah. Crazy Like Foxes reinforced concrete boxes, is hollow, with walls only 9 to 15 inches thick, be ing faced and trimmed with the original granite. Even so, there are 10,000 blocks of it, weighing anywhere from a half ton to eight tons each, for a total of more than 10,000 tons. All have been laboriously loosened and lifted off the old bridge in England and are being set, one at a time, back in their very same relative positions. The peak crew here is around 30, and they are attaching with steel and mortar roughly 40 stones a day. They have around 3,500 still to go, some just ar rived because the last of them were only recently removed in London as the new bridge there, streamlined and with only two piers, takes shape without inter rupting traffic. I drive a little farther. The “water” is sand, right up under the arches where it was piled as a mold when they poured the overall concrete skin. The dry land construction reportedly has saved $1 million. Sir John Rennie had to drive 9,800 piles. From here you can see clearly that the arches aren't all the same size. The center one is 152 feet across and 2 feet higher than the 140‐foot spans on either side. The end arches are 130 feet and an additional 3 feet lower, causing the whole bridge to arch. Inside the fence chunks of granite await setting. Here are two marked 7D24 and 7D25. Next are 7D18 and 7D19. Oh, oh, 7D12 and 7D15. What happened to 13 and 14? But I'm certain the Englishmen I saw coding the stones as they were pried off in London didn't drop any into the Thames. All four of the piers that will stand in water and the two abutments that touch the land have been hung with granite on this side. Masons now are working around on the west. When the sand is removed, the last stones to be attached will be the heavy turtlebacks on the pier footings. As I reach the far end—the City end both in London and here—a man in white shirt and dark trousers just fin ishes snapping a picture. “I walked across it as a boy,” he volunteers. His nearby car bears Washington State li cense plates. “Oh, over to Southwark?” I ask. “Sutherk,” he replies. Another tourist, in shorts, keeps ma neuvering to focus his camera on the edge of the bridge to show the corbels, the swan‐necked pieces that protrude outward from the bridge floor to sup port the sidewalks. They date to 1903, when the bridge was made wider, and there are 700 of them, 350 along each side. A camper truck pulls up squarely in front of the camera's target. “That's always the way,” grumbles the frus trated picture taker. One of the workmen beckons. He wants to point out that underneath, be tween the corbels, lights have been in stalled to bathe the sides of the bridge in a soft glow at night. He invites me to step into the clutter and get down on my stomach to peer over the edge and see the lights. I take his word that they are there. The roadway will he illuminated by 22 lampposts being reproduced in Brit ain, at a cost of $3,900 apiece, from old photographs of the original 1831 fix tures (four also are being made for Lon don's new bridge). In case they don't arrive in time, the 10 that date to the remodeling will pinch‐hit. I run my hand along the top of the weather‐blackened block of granite from which balusters already stretch out to the first arch on what would be the downriver side in London. There are 1,400 balusters in the two balustrades, or railings. A granite rail fits along their tops. But the block of granite along which I have run my hand—it's special, as you can see by the inscription on it. It tells “The last time I saw the bridge was on a chill March afternoon in London in 1968, a month be fore it would be sold to make way for a much broader span to carry today's growing traffic. Now I am watching them put it back together in the desert. At the start of the undertaking the Indians came with their tom‐toms to invoke good fortune on it.” you the Lord Mayor of London came here on Sept. 23, 1968, and rededicated this foundation stone of London Bridge. A work crew has just moved the 8,900‐ pound block over from where it first was set in a grove of palms, now dug up to clear the approaches. Here at the bridge you can close your eyes for moment, or at least I could, and imagine King William IV, uncle of Queen Vic toria, riding down the Thames in his royal barge on Aug. 1, 1831, to a great bridge‐opening banquet for 2,000 be neath a canopy extending almost half way across the span. My circle of the construction area completed after several more stops to view the bridge's silhouette against the ranges of mountains to the east, I am hack at my starting point and go to find Robert Beresford, the 31‐year‐old British resident engineer, in his office behind the gasoline station. Beresford was sent here in May, 1969, fresh from a South African assignment, by the London company taking down the bridge. His job: put it back togeth er. If all continues on schedule, he and his wife and their baby daughter, born here, will be going home for Christmas. He laughs when I comment on the model on his office windowsill; it's of Tower Bridge, not London Bridge. He lifts the top off one of the silver towers to reveal a bottle fitted neatly inside. It is empty. On one wall is a framed en largement of Rennie's signed scale drawings for London Bridge. “We've just been working since Nov. 3, 1969,” he notes. “But of course theirs was all hand labor. Even their crude derricks were operated by hand.” “When this bridge is finished, visual ly it will be the same as it was in Lon don,” Beresford emphasizes. “But inter nally it's a lot different.” In a way, he adds, it's a good thing it's hollow. Be cause all the utility lines—water, gas, electric, telephone—to the future island are inside it. “Did you get down to bedrock to set the piers?” “No,” and he explains that regardless of the Biblical parable about the foolish man who built his house upon the sand, “compacted sand and gravel make good foundation.” In the near abutment is scaled a time capsule containing tribal tokens of the Indians who lived here. The Indians came with their tom‐toms to invoke good fortune on the undertaking when it was started and it was on that occa sion that they made McCulloch a chief. Now I am going to see him, because small white business jet has just brought “the man who bought London Bridge” and his master planner on a rush visit from Los Angeles to check on how the construction is coming along. While McCulloch slows down for luncheon gin martini on the rocks, cheeseburger and chocolate sundae in motel restaurant, I listen to him‐6 foot 2, ruddy, gray‐haired, sport‐shirted, an engineer, Princeton and Stanford '31, and chairman of the board of four Mc Culloch corporations—the oil company, the chain saw and engine manufactur ers, the aircraft firm that is just turn ing out in the industrial park area here its first white and tan helicopters that you see whirling overhead, and the real estate subsidiary that's developing this and two other new communities, a sec ond in Arizona and one in Chicago. McCulloch says he was flying over the area in the early 1960's, hunting a site for a new city, when he spotted the pe ninsula. “If that were only an island,” he says he remembers thinking, “we could name it Desert Isle.” What an ad vertising line! Maybe they could dig channel and make it an island. It would be simple to bridge it. Yes? Three years after acquiring the land and founding Lake Havasu City, McCul loch and C. V. Wood Jr., the man who planned and built Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas and is now president of the McCulloch Oil Corporation, were tuned in one night to the TV news, On the screen flashed a picture of the ar rival in New York of two Englishmen come to America to peddle London Bridge. Both McCulloch and Wood, as they tell it now, had the same thought. “How do we get it?” McCulloch says he didn't even remem ber at the time that he had walked on the bridge during a trip to Europe as lad of 16. But he certainly remembers his next walk on it, which took place on an overcast afternoon in mid‐April, 1968. Big Ben, upriver, tolled 4 o'clock as he and Wood went strolling (it's difficult to imagine either cutting down to a stroll) across the historic span. Their hid of $2,460,000 had just been accepted out of the score or more reported to have been submitted for the world‐famous structure They could see it already be ing taken down. The City of London had stressed was selling the stonework to allow its reuse as facing for a new bridge “of similar shape and design so that London Bridge, an outstanding example of 19th century skill in masonry design and construction, is not lost to future gen erations.” How did McCulloch and Wood hit upon the amount to bid? They knew the London authorities had estimated it would cost £500,000 —$1,200,000 — to dismantle the bridge (terms called for the City of London to do that and de liver the stone to the Surrey Dock, where the buyers could take delivery). As businessmen, the two Americans fig ured London would want as much again to help pay for their new bridge. This would bring it to $2,400,000. Then, for an odd amount that might edge their bid above the others: McCulloch would reach the age of 60 in 1971, when they estimated the project could he com pleted. So they tacked on $60,000. Ergo: a winning bid of $2,460,000. Something's been worrying me. I saw the London workmen painting numbers on each stone being removed. I've seen the markings on them here (along with “Good Luck Yank” in one instance). Each stone has its place in the plans that came with the bridge. So what about the piece of the bridge given that little girl in New York as a souvenir at the time of the purchase? And how about the two big blocks of its granite sent over to London, Ont., for its annual festival? (I asked in Canada's London why they didn't buy the bridge but could see why after observing that their Thames is less than half as wide as Eng land's.) And how about the stones they've lent for display to stores in Seattle and Phoenix and Las Vegas? And the chips jack‐hammered off a block and handed out as souvenirs in Hollywood by Robert P. McCulloch Jr., the executive directly in charge of the London Bridge recon struction? Aren't they going to end up missing few pieces—like having an incomplete jigsaw puzzle? I can stop worrying. None of the coded stones has been given away or lent. Not only that, but London has sent along enough extra to take care of the souvenir trade for the next 10 or 15 years. My chip glued to the orange card just a starter.

192-> Black Miners Flock to South Africa
EVANDER South Africa, Nov. 10 — “Don't believe what you read and hear about us overseas,” the mining official told a group of foreign visitors. The official, discussing “that talk about us exploiting cheap native labor,” said, “We not only payout Bantu miners, we feed them 4,000 calories a day each, we train them, we give them health and dental care, we provide recreation for them, and when they go hack to their homelands after or 18 months everyone of them has saved a tidy sum of money,” That sum, at best, is a few hundred dollars. The average cash pay for a black laborer in South Africa's gold mines is about $22 a month for nine hours of back‐breaking work underground six days a week. Thousands Attracted Abysmally low though such wages are by the standards of the mining industry in North America and Europe, they keep attracting thousands of young blacks, week after week, from all over southern Africa to the “golden arc” that stretches from the Orange Free State to this 12‐year‐old goldfield in the Transvaal, 65 miles southeast of Johannesburg. During a daylong visit to Bracken Mines, Ltd., a twinshaft complex employing 4,000 black miners and 360 whites, a human climate was found that combined managerial paternalism with the stern discipline of an army camp. Officials of the mine referred to their black workers as “boys” or “natives” and appeared convinced that they knew best what was good for them. 16 to a Room In the barracks‐like compound where the indentured black miners are obliged to live 16 to a room, religious images and cutouts from mail. order catalogues serve as pinups above hunks. On the mine's Level 4, 1,200 feet underground, a laborer from Malawi who was shoveling rock debris from the face of the gold‐bearing reef froze to attention when a white overseer asked him whether he had observed the safety check list. The overseer, John Pretorius, and the miner spoke in Fanakalo— literally, “like this”—the lingua franca of South African mines. Fanakalo, which is based on the Zulu language with words borrowed from other tribal idioms, English and Afrikaans, enables black miners from 50 ethnic groups to work side by side. Almost all the 360,000 black miners employed in South Africa's goldfields are immigrants from the Portuguese territory of Mozambique, the independent states of Malawi, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho, and South Africa's tribal reserves. Recent outbreaks of violence, are attributed by mining officials to tribal rivalries. In a riot at the Daggafontein Mine near here a few days ago, at least four men were killed. The police said that a fight between a miner from the Transkei and one from Malawi had escalated into a tribal clash involving hundreds. In relations with management and supervisory personnel the black miners arc said to he docile. Black foremen who wear brass shoulder patches inscribed “boss boy” are earning up to $45 a month, including productivity bonuses, but cannot rise higher. The manager of a milling and smelting plant said: “Many of our Bantu boys unofficially do work that officially is reserved for white miners, and they do it well. However, the powerful white miners’ unions keep vetoing any promotion of Africans. ‘A Very Nice Life’ “Some white miners who have gangs of 20 to 50 Bantu boys under them have a very nice life with very little actual work—and they have a very high standard of living.” A recent study by the South African Institute of Race Relations, a civil‐rights organization, showed that the average earnings of white gold miners were 21 times those of blacks. In 1944 a white miner was paid 10 times as much as a black, the study said. African miners have no unions and are forbidden by law to strike.

193-> Advertising: Magazineland Picks Its Bigwig
Gib McCabe, a Newsweek man for 29 years, once its publisher and now its vice chairman, will be getting the Henry Johnson Fisher Award. It's the biggest thing in the magazine industry, the Pub lisher of the Year. During his years in the company's executive row, Gibson McCabe has become such an advocate of keeping messages brief and to the point that he has earned the nickname “Short‐Copy Mc Cabe.” Well, if that's the way he likes it. Second Thoughts On second thought, maybe this time we can make an exception on copy length. After all, you still don't know who gives out the Fisher award and who else has got ten it since it started in 1963. Named for the one‐time chairman of the McCall Cor poration, and its first recipi ent, the award is bestowed annually by the Magazine Publishers Association, in which Mr. McCabe has been active for some 20 years. He'll get his on Sept. 17. And you can tell he feels honored at being in the company of such greats as DeWitt Wal lace of Reader's Digest, the late Henry R. Luce of Time and Richard E. Berlin of Hearst. At the moment, the 60‐year‐old executive, who is a former chairman of the M.P.A., is chairman of its postal committee, certainly the hot spot these days. But who could be more prepared than a guy who started on circulation side? And at The New York Times to boot. When he started at The Times in 1933, having learned from a friend about the job opening, he arrived as no stranger to newspapers. His father, the late Robert C. Mc Cabe had been a top editor on many papers, including posts as managing editor of The Boston American and The Baltimore News and feature and rotogravure edi tor of The Herald Tribune. And his grandfather, James D. McCabe, minister and his torian, was a writer with a reportorial style. With that kind of a back ground it's a wonder that Gib McCabe, two years out of Princeton, didn't shoot for writing job. “I just liked the business end of it,” he explained yes terday in his comfortable of fice where a sculpture of a golfer indicates the occupants bent. “I loved the smell of newspaper office but I never had the desire to be a writer. This satisfied both drives, to get into business and get into the publishing business.” And a few years later it was as circulation director that he joined the six‐year‐old Newsweek. That was its last year in the red. Prob ably just a coincidence. “A circulation background is important to a fellow in a top spot,” said the man who should know. After World War II serv ice with the Navy and a European stint for News week, Gib McCabe was named ad manager in 1947 and found no difficulty making the transition from circulation. “I like selling and I like people and ad vertising selling is a much more personal thing,” he said. Since circulation and ad vertising backgrounds make a fellow a natural for a publisher's job, it was quite natural that he found him self in that slot in 1958 having already been a gen eral manager and named vice president and director. The following year he was also named president of the company. He was publisher until 1963 and turned over the president's chair to Osborn Elliott, the editor in chief, earlier this year. That's when he popped up to vice chairman and chairman of the finance committee of Newsweek Inc., (a division of The Washington Post Com pany) which also publishes Art News and has a book di vision. How has life changed? “The main difference,” he said, “is that instead of the buck stopping here, it stops with Oz.” And how does he feel about short copy?

194-> Israel Weighs New U.S. Plan Aimed at Opening Suez Canal
JERUSALEM. Oct. 24 — Is rael's Cabinet deferred its de cision today on participating in a reported new attempt of the United States to begin indirect negotiations toward an interim settlement to reopen the Suez Canal. It was understood that Israeli diplomats would be in structed to seek further clari fication of the proposal. Spe cifically, they would be told to discover whether the American mediators would serve simply as go‐betweens for Israel and Egypt, or would put forward their own plans and ideas. Israel was also expected to say that she wished to be com pensated for the risk of enter ing into these indirect talks. The compensation desired was believed to be the addi tional security of new supplies of Phantom jet aircraft, which the United States has so far re fused to provide. A Cabinet spokesman said only that the unusually long five‐and‐a‐half hour Cabinet session had ended without a decision on the pending diplo matic proposals. Other, sources said a Government decision was likely at next Sunday's Cabinet meeting, after further exchanges with the United States. Premier Golda Meir is sched uled to deliver a compre hensive policy statement to the Knesset, or Parliament, on Tuesday. But without a firm decision on the new American initiative, it seemed unlikely that she could talk about the further evolution of the Middle East confrontation in much detail. The precise content of the American proposal has not been officially released, but its main provisions are reliably reported to be as follows: ¶Assistant Secretary of State Joseph J. Sisco would servo as a mediator between delegations from Israel and Egypt in a concerted attempt to find a for mula for an interim settlement. ¶The two delegations and Mr. Sisco would post themselves at the same or nearby hotels in New York City for the duration of the talks. Pre sumably, representation would be at the level of the two coun tries' delegates to the United Nations, though this has been left open. ¶Next month, when the Gen eral Assembly is discussing the Middle East, would be the most desirable time for the talks to begin. If they do begin then, the Israeli and Egyptian For eign Ministers would probably be present to open the negoti ations. ¶There would be no inten tion, in the early stages at least, that the two delegations meet face to face. The details of this formula were believed to have been con veyed to the Israeli Government last Thursday, when Foreign Minister Abba Eban met the United States chargé d'affairs, J. Owen Zurhellen, at Mr. Zur hellen's request. Mr. Eban had returned from the United Na tions headquarters in New York only the day before, say ing on his arrival that he did not yet know what the next diplomatic steps would be. The reservations of Israeli policymakers on the new Amer ican initiative center on the fear that Mr. Sisco would at some point inject into the dis cussions a separate American plan for an interim settlement. They believe this plan would probably be along the lines of the six‐point formula outlined by Secretary of State William P. Rogers before the General Assembly. Israel has already rejected these points of Mr. Rogers, arguing that they undercut the Israeli bargaining position. Is rael says that the Rogers formula gives in to Egyptian demands for a cease‐fire limited in time, and that it also would give Egyptian troops the oppor tunity to cross the Suez Canal onto the Israeli‐occupied Sinai Peninsula when the canal was being cleared for shipping. The canal has been closed since the 1967 war.

196-> Prolonged Fight to Save Albany's 70‐Year‐Old Union Station Appears to Be Ending in Final Defeat
ALBANY, May 1—The citi zens of this city who Sought for years to retain their 70‐ year‐old Union Station as a railroad depot and, when that failed, tried to keep it as a his toric landmark, appeared today to be facing final defeat. Almerin C. O'Hara, the Com missioner of General Services, has announced that the state will auction off the old station where Presidents, would‐have been Presidents, Governors and foreigr dignitaries once stopped. The announcement also said the purchaser might demolish it if he wished. He said the state would also sell at auction the 54‐year‐old Albany Journal Building, but the purchaser of that structure will not be allowed to demolish it or change its facade because the structure is an integral part of the Delaware and Hud son Plaza. The plaza is a com plex of buildings at the foot of State Street, with a common and striking Flemish ‐ Gothic facade. State officials and architects want to preserve the archi tectural symmetry of the com plex that with its high tower, elaborate ornamental work and stone walls dominates down town Albany. The Albany Journal Building, which still bears the name of a newspaper that went out of business in 1926, was built as an annex to the Delaware & Hudson Railroad Building. The railroad uses the main building for its offices and rents out space to other concerns. Union Station is on Broad way, a few blocks north of the plaza. Once a gleaming monu ment, it is now begrimed and shabby. Its doors and street floor windows are boarded up and those on the floor above are broken. The station, which has been described as railroad‐classic, was opened ceremoniously by the New York Central Railroad on Dec. 17, 1900. Its waiting room is in the grand tradition, 134 feet long and 103 feet wide with a ceiling 52 feet high. The station was opened 10 years before New York City's Pennsylvania Station and 13 years before Grand Central Terminal. For years the station, de signed by the Boston archi tectural concern, Shepley, Ru tan & Coolidge, was one of the busiest in the stare with famed but now‐discontinued trains stopping there. The New York Central, now a part of the Penn Central, announced in 1959 that it would move to a smaller station in Rensselaer, across the Hudson River. Alarmed and embarrassed by the thought that their state capital would be left without a railroad station, Albany resi dents fought to delay the move. But on Dec. 29, 1963, the sta tion was quietly closed and traffic was transferred to the Rensselaer station, a plain one‐ story structure With an un distinguished, strictly func tional waiting room. The state bought the old building and the land around it for $5.2‐million, to make way for an arterial highway along the waterfront. The station and the 2.6 acres of land that will be sold with it have been ap praised at $1,428,000. The Albany Journal Building was purchased by the state in 1926 for $550,000 and for many years it was occupied by a state agency. The auctions are expected to take place within the next six weeks. Commissioner O'Hara said that the state regretted selling the two buildings of “known historical and architectural heritage,” but that it was doing so because of the state's tight fiscal situation and the high cost of renovation. Those trying to save the old station have suggested that it be used as a convention hall, a railroad museum, a sports center, a restaurant, a garage or an office building.

198-> UKRAINIANS CALM ABOUT THE VISITOR
VEGREVILLE, Alberta—Like a great many of the 500,000 Canadians of Ukrainian birth or ancestry, the people of this farm town on the northern plains have shown little interest in the Canadian visit of the Soviet Premier, Aleksei N. Ko sygin. “It's not a conversation piece at the coffee counter,” com mented Michael W. Kawulych, a lawyer, a few days ago. “Demonstrate?” said Mrs. Anna Pidruchney, who teaches Ukrainian and English in the junior high school. “I think that's below us, a march like that. We want to discuss things on a roundtable basis.” Roughly four of five Canadi an Ukrainians were born in Canada, the descendants of the 238,000 Ukrainians who immi grated between 1891 and 1939. The most strongly anti‐Soviet element is found among the nearly 40,000 Ukrainians who have arrived since World War II. Some of these displaced per sons had voluntarily moved to Germany or Poland before the Red Army pushed the Germans out of the Ukraine. Explaining why some Ukrainians wanted a German victory, C. N. Sucho wersky, president of the Edmondton chapter of the Ukrainian National Federation, an anti‐Communist organiza tion, said, “we believed the Germans would give the Ukraine self‐administration.” The postwar Ukrainian em migrants “helped Hitler and we Canadians fought Hitler,” said Frank Lakusta, a 58‐year‐old Canadian‐born Ukrainian. He recalled that during the war he serviced United States aircraft bound for the Soviet Union. Mr. Lakusta, a farmer who lives in Edmonton, said of the tour by Mr. Kosygin, “we like to see a visit like this because [it may mean that] we can sell more wheat to the Russians.” The postwar Ukrainian emi grants, many of them skilled tradesmen, professionals and intellectuals, have settled in the cities, notably Winnipeg, Toronto and Edmonton. Cana dian‐born Ukrainians have been drifting from the farms to the cities, but many still live in towns like Vegreville. Originally founded by French Canadians, the town now has 3,700 inhabi tants, more than half of whom are Ukrainians. In Ottawa the other day, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau gave Mr. Kosygin a list of hundreds of Ukrainian families that wished to be re united. Mr. Kosygin had asked for such a list when Mr. Tru deau raised the Ukrainian question in Moscow in May. Mr. Kawulych, the Vegre ville lawyer, who speaks Ukrainian, visited “the old country” last summer on a group tour. “We were disappointed at what is being done to our peo ple,” he said. “If they open up the boundaries, I don't know there would be a soul left. They know enough about the outside world that they want to get out—especially that younger element. They'd walk night and day.” When they settled on the prairies in a 100‐mile‐wide strip reaching from southeast ern Manitoba to the Edmonton area, the Canadian Ukrainians invariably built a church and a hall, or cultural center. With the population drift from farm to city, and the birth of new generations, adherence to tra ditional religion, language and customs has weakened. Mrs. Elizabeth Sokoloski, who operates a Vegreville cafe with her husband, said that young people, like her daugh ter, an Anglican, were drifting away from the Ukrainian churches (Catholic and Ortho dox) because they didn't know the Ukrainian language. The school teacher, Mrs. Pidruchney, a tall erect woman with vitality and purpose, in sisted that a revival of interest in Ukrainian culture was oc curring. Of 300 pupils in her school, she said, 100 had elect ed to study Ukrainian. She added: “We no longer are ashamed of the Ukrainian. Before, we were ‘Bohunked,’ and all that. That is over now. My pupils greet me in Ukrainian on the street.” Mrs. Pidruchney teaches Ukrainian from books printed in the Soviet Union. She said some of these extolled Lenin, but she glossed over him. One facet of Ukrainian cul ture that may be resistant to assimilation is cooking. Many women still prepare pirogi dumplings (filled with potatoes, cheese or fruit), borscht, sauer kraut soup, poppy‐seed buns, cabbage rolls, baked cornmeal and kolach, the round, braided bread baked for festive occa sions.

199-> CANCER RESEARCH IS VOTED BY HOUSE
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 — The House passed today, by a vote of 350 to 5. a major cancer research bill that differs sharply from one passed earlier by the Senate with backing from the White House. The vote today was a strong rebuff for those who want an independent agency established to expand the research effort against cancer. The House bill would expand the effort, calling for the spending of nearly $1.6billion during the next three years, but it would keep cancer research tied closely to the National Institutes of Health, the Federal Government's main agency for biological and medical research. The Senate bill, passed by a 79‐to‐1 vote on July 7, would, set up a largely independent cancer research agency linked in name, but in little else, to the institutes, which are known collectively as the N.I.H. The differences between the two bills must now be resolved by a House‐Senate conference committee. Representative Paul G. Rogers, Democrat of Florida the House bill's chief sponsor told reporters he hoped this would be accomplished before Christmas. He said that he be sieved the Senate could be convinced on the key difference between the two bills. Vote Under Special Rule The vote today was under a special rule that requires a two thirds majority for passage and prevents any amendments on the House floor. The five negative votes were by Representatives Brock Adams of Washing ton, Frank J. Brasco of New York, James C. Corman of California, John J. Rooney of New york and Robert O. Tiernan of Rhode Island, all Democrats. In general, the opponents favored substituting the Senate bill for the one that had originated in the House. In the brief debate before the vote today, both sides said that they had White House approval. The Administration's position appears to have shifted markedly during the year. It has Supported the concept of a much‐expanded cancer research effort, but early in the year the position seemed to be that the cancer effort should be kept linked to the National Institutes of Health. The reasoning was that establishment of a separate agency might lead to the disintegration of the N.I.H., an agency that has made crucial contributions to the progress of bioMedical research during the last two decades. This same objection to a separate agency has been voiced by important organizations and individuals in the medical‐scientific community. Later, however, White House emphasis was placed on a cancer effort under the direct supervision of the President and thus largely independent of the Institutes. Late in the Senate deliberations over its measure, the Administration gave its backing to a compromise bill that was little different from the original Senate bill, of which Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, was the chief sponsor. The Kennedy bill made the cancer agency a part of the N.I.H. in name, but called for its director to report to the President rather than the director of the N.I.H. and gave it an independent budget. The Administration continued to support the Senate bill while a House committee was holding hearings and drafting its own alternative legislation this fall. Today, however, Representative William L. Springer, Republican of Illinois, said on the House floor that he had spoken recently to the President concerning the House bill and that the President expressed approval. This was taken to mean that the Admin istration did not object to the House version although presumably still preferring the Senate version. The House bill would expand the National Cancer Institute and would make its director an associate director of the N.I.H. Directors of two other institutes—the National Heart and Lung Institute and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke—would be similarly elevated on the grounds that these three institutes are involved in research on the diseases that cause the deaths of almost 70 per cent of Americans. All three directors would become Presidential appointees. The cancer Institute budget would go directly to the Office of Management and Budget and to the President without change by the director of the N.I.H. or the Secretary of the parent department — Health, Education and Welfare. The director and the Secretary would be asked to comment on the cancer budget, however. A three‐man independent panel, also appointed by the President, would serve as a watchdog on the cancer effort and would report to him periodically on its progress. The House bill would also change, for purposes of greater efficiency, some of the operating rules by which the cancer institute makes research grants. It would also re‐establish programs to detect cervical and breast cancer. These programs, which are for patient service, rather than for research, were phased out by the Administration about a year ago. The bill would also call for the establishment of 15 new clinical research centers in the cancer field and would authorize block grants of $5‐million a year for each. The total cancer budget authorization for three years would come to $1.59‐billion with step‐by‐step increases in each of the next three years. The proposed expansion of the national effort against cancer has been the subject of intense lobbying during much of this year. High officers of the American Cancer Society have been outspoken In their suppart of the Senate bill. Mrs. Mary Lasker, New York philanthropist who has often been influential in national health research policy matters, has also supported it. Both the Senate bill and the differing House version were influenced by the report last year of a panel of consultants to the Senate that recommended a separate cancer research agency to eliminate bureaucratic impediments in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The House bill has followed the panel's recommendations in estimating the need for funds for cancer research during the next few years, although it does not follow its advice concerning a separate agency. It does call for the establishment of a national cancer research plan, also advocated by the panel of consultants.

200-> CITY'S BRONX MAP IS DRAWN ASKEW
Yankee Stadium is in the upper Bronx, right? And the New York Giants are moving up to Jersey, right? Also, as any Bronx official could tell you, the Hudson River on his official borough map seems to flow from west to east. If all this sounds like things aren't on the up and up, it's because of that strange official map. Things are officially atilt. Nobody seems to know for sure how and why it started, but for some years the official borough map shows the borough in a sideways position. In other words, the top of the map is not north, but west. The effect is somewhat like trying to tell time when the “12” on the clock face is where the “3” should be. That means that the Hudson River runs across the top of the map like some Northwest Passage. And City Hall in Manhattan would be far out in left field for the Bronxite studying his official map. The official working maps displayed on the wall in the office of Bronx Borough President Robert Abrams in the Bronx County Courthouse are those sideways charts. They are maps on which officials have put little labels to point out the location of such facilities as schools, hospitals, police stations and firehouses. While Ethan Geto, Bronx public information officer, claims to have no difficulty in reading the askew maps, it is not uncommon to observe others canting their heads sharply to the right to get their bearings. Bronx Councilman Bertram R. Gelfand says it is no wonder that “city services,” like sanitation trucks, have so much difficulty in locating the Bronx. He suggests that the map may have been the idea of a city administration “made up of a lot of out‐oftowners.” Mr. Geto had a possible solution to the mystery of the sideways approach by the mapmakers. “Up here (he should have said, ‘out here’) everyone orients himself by the Grand Concourse, and the Concourse on these maps runs directly across them.” Anyhow, he added, “all our borough maps are like that,” including the most recently printed ones. Mr. Abrams, who recently returned from a trip to West Africa, said that, sure, the Bronx had a unique map, but since it was the only borough attached to mainland America it was entitled to a little different treatment. Asked if he had flown over the North Pole on his trip to Africa, Mr. Abrams replied, “Now, cut that out!” Leonard Piekarsky, consulting engineer to Mr. Abrams and in charge of the map department, said that at least as far back as 1.595 the official map was sideways. He surmised that turning the map sideways made it easier to read the name of the major streets like the Concourse, but he added: “People look at it and say, ‘Gee, where's Riverdale?’” Mr. Piekarsky also confessed that in his own office he had turned the sideways map around so that north was at the top, as on other maps. “I got confused so I turned it around to match the rest of the city,” he said.

201-> Reader's Report
Growing up black in a city like Boston is the theme of this often moving novel. The home life of young Garner Hawkins is not auspicious: one older brother dabbles in armed rob‐ bery, another is a pimp, and Garner tries both specialties be fore opting for a better escape from the slums. Mr. Smith does not allow his hero to make pat decisions or sudden con versions; he delineates with some subtlety the inertia that keeps the boy from moving out into mainstream America, as poverty, self‐doubt, and big otry chip away at his self‐es teem. Both his brothers die violent deaths before the novel ends. Garner himself is finally salvaged by an athletic scholar ship and a couple of men bene factors. If Mr. Smith is overly declarative at times, his picture of the slow accretion of racial pride is utterly convincing.

202-> Azerbaijani Knows How to Get Things Done
BAKU, U.S.S.R.—In many ways Ahmet Aliyev is a typical Azerbaiyani. He makes more money than most, but like many other young men he loves the fiery, temperamental play of his local soccer team, he is proud of the new apartment developments sprawling around Baku and he knows how to get things done. To be a taxi driver, to get an apartment, to build a house or to do almost anything important, “either you have to have a friend or it takes money,” he explained over a glass of jam‐sweetened tea in his two‐room stone house. A few years ago he and his cousin, a mechanic, wanted to build a private house in a village on the outskirts of this half‐Victorian, half‐Islamic city on the Caspian Sea. To get permission from the municipal land control committee, he said money had to be passed discreetly to the local policeman. “Now it costs about 500 rubles,” he reported matterof‐factly. “Before it was less.” And what happens if there is a new militiamen in the neighborhood?” “Ohhh,” he groaned, “that is very difficult.” Mr. Aliyev, a short, darkhaired, dark‐eyed man in his late twenties, hopes eventually to move into one of the naked, nondescript new developments around Baku, which he finds “beautiful and modern.” But that is even more difficult. Without a good friend in the state‐run housing office or a hefty bribe, he explained, “you have to wait 20 or 30 years for a new apartment.” Though he was exaggerating, high officials have acknowledged Baku's acute need for more housing to replace seriously substandard dwellings. To go by car to the house the Aliyev cousins built, a visitor has to bounce up a twisting, gullied dirt road fit only for jeeps. But as an experienced taxi driver, Mr. Aliyev raced up in an old Volga with practiced ease. In his fence yard a few underfed hens scampered out of the way as he strolled past his outdoor water faucet. In Azerbaijan's arid climate and with Baku's meager water supply, there was no hope that grass would grace the littered yard. Inside things were more cheerful. To dress up the large bedroom‐living room for visitors, Mrs. Aliyev had quickly decorated the single bed with stacks of yellow pillows draped with lace and with a bright red bedspread. The wooden floor was bare and a dressing table, decorated with family snapshots, stood at one side. The other room in their half of the house was a modest, narrow kitchen with simple, recently installed two‐burner gas stove at one end and a simple sink at the other. Next to the sink was a Soviet‐made radio with a short‐wave band. There is not much to do, Mr. Aliyev said, but spend evenings with his wife and listen to the radio or drink beer. He said the radio could pick up not only Soviet programs but also Western ones, especially at night. Western jazz interests him, but he clearly prefers Azerbaijani music, whose rhythms are closely akin to the music ofthe Arab world, testimony to centuries of Persian, Turkish and Arab occupation. Mr. Aliyev put on a longplaying record of a popular Azerbaijani vocalist Senab Khanlarova, and talked with his guests of life in Baku while his wife hid in the background, never joining the conversation and rarely even entering the room. At her husband's command she brought out the tea and cherry jam and their one bottle of beer and all the food in the house — two pomegranates, a few apples and a small bowl of figs. They were married two years ago, right after Mrs. Aliyev finished her 10 years of schooling and within a month of her 18th birthday —the minimum legal age in Azerbaijan. Being a taxi driver, Mr. Aliyev related, is much better than working in the oilfields that have made Baku famous or even in one of the newer factories. “This is better,” he asserted. “In the factory the work is hard and dirty. My work is clean and not very hard.” In an eight‐hour shift, he said, he takes in a minimum of 20 rubles to meet his state‐prescribed quota for the state‐owned taxi (Moscow drivers take in at, least 30 rubles a day). Anything over the minimum he pockets. In a city of 1.3 million people, where drivers often persuade customers to share rides, it is very easy, Mr. Aliyev said to take in at least 30 rubles a day and often more. Generally, he added, he makes 300 to 400 rubles a month, which, even allowing for exaggeration, is more than double the average factory worker's pay. A taxi driver's job is a coveted one, he acknowledged, and it often costs several hundred rubles in bribes to get one. He said he had arranged his through an old friend.

203-> Civilians Named Pakistani Ministers
RAWALPINDI, Pakistan, Dec. 7—With the war between Paidstan and India reaching a critical phase, Pakistan's President tonight appointed a civilian Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister whose immediate task is to plead Pakistan's case before the United Nations. The President, Gen. Agha Mohamad Yahya Khan, will retain the real power but he has at least nomnially honored commitments that he would form a civilian government by the end of the year. General Yahya Khan named Nurul Amin, a Bengali lawyer and politician from East Pakistn whose right‐wing party won one seat out of 313 in a National Assembly election a year ago today, as Prime Minister. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a former Foreign Minister, who is leader of West Parkistan's majority party, the Pakistan People party, was named Deputy Prime Minister. Mr. Bhutto, who is 43 years old, is a West Pakistani who graduated from the University of California. Mr. Amin's role in Government seems likely to be primarily ceremonial. Mr. Bhutto, who was also named as Foreign Minister, is leaving tonight for New York to plead Pakistan's case for international support against India. He said in an interview after his appointment that he viewed the war with India as his single concern for the time being and that politics and civil administation could be considered only after the present crisis was over. By tonight the situation in East Pakistan had clearly become extremely grave for the defending Pakistani forces. A Pakistani spokesman acknowledged that Indian forces had made sizable gains there and that the city of Jessore, south‐ west of Dacca, was threatened from several directions by advancing troops that had captured Benapol. A spokesman said the Indians were advancing in the Brahamanbaria area of Comilla District from the east, from the north into Mymensingh District after capturing the outpost at Kamalpur and in the north‐ western part of East Pakistan. Despite many Indian Air Force attacks during the day on Dacca, a Pakistani spokesman said, Pakistani planes were not in combat in East Pakistan all day long. Reporting on the fighting, a naval spokesman said a Pakistani destroyer that had been hit by missiles from Indian planes several days ago had sunk. He said that enemy forces operating within the territorial waters of East Pakistan had captured six United Nations coastal vessels carrying relief food grains. In this connection, Pakistan today denounced India for seizing the coastal vessels and called the action “a deliberate and callous policy of denying food to East Pakistan.” Pakistan also charged that India was deliberately bombing centers of civilian population and that if this continued Pakistan intended to retaliate in kind. Military and diplomatic spokesmen here said that at least 300 civilians had been killed by Indian air raids during the last 36 hours. Heavy raids were carried out last night on two densely populated slums in Karachi in which the Government said 112 persons were killed and more than 200 wounded. A Western correspondent in Karachi said he had seen 42 bodies at one hospital after the raid. A community near a jute mill outside Dacca in East Pakistan also was reported heavily hit with about 150 dead and 100 wounded.

204-> Survey Finds Private Colleges Must Have ‘Significant Aid’ to Offset Expected Deficits
A survey of 75 per cent of the country's 762 private, ac credited four‐year colleges and universities shows that nearly half expect operating deficits in the current fiscal year total ing about $87‐million. Private higher education, on the whole, is “not yet in des perate straits,” according to a report on the survey issued yes terday by the Association of American Colleges. But, the re port continued, “Private col leges and universities are appre hensive and they have reason to be. Most colleges in the red are staying in the red and many are getting redder, while col leges in the black are generally growing grayer.” The report, released here and at an association meeting in Cincinnati, said that private institutions “will not long be able to serve higher education and the nation with strength unless significant aid is soon forthcoming.” Officials of the association called the survey the “most comprehensive study” of the fi nancial status of private col leges and universities. The in stitutions responding to the survey, they said, were repre sentative of all private higher education. Dr. Clark Kerr, chairman of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education, said last month that two‐thirds of all American colleges and univer sities were in grave financial difficulty or headed in that di rection. He based his estimate on an intensive study for the commission of 41 private and public institutions in 21 states. Among the key points in the report issued yesterday were the following: ¶The type of Federal aid preferred by the colleges and universities were grants di rectly to institutions for general use or physical facilities. How ever, aid in “virtually any form,” including grants and loans directly to students, ap peared acceptable. ¶An increasing number of in stitutions seem to be under estimating the deficits they will incur—fewer institutions ac tually expect a deficit than last year. ¶The most popular methods to reduce existing deficits were to borrow and to transfer funds from unappropriated surpluses, while the most popular way, by far, to head off deficits was to raise tuition. ¶The granting of student aid was placing “a considerable burden” on the institutions— ‘the increase alone in the last four years was $10‐million, or 904 per cent. The report, prepared by Wil liam W. Jellema, the associa tion's research director, ana lyzed “hard” data or financial projections for the fiscal years 1967‐68 through 1970‐71, the present year. A “bad situation deteriorated rapidly” after 1968, it noted. “Instruction costs are higher with no increase in productiv ity, building costs are higher, maintenance costs are higher, security costs are higher, stu dents and their parents are demanding ‘wall‐to‐wall’ serv ices, while inflation has con tinued to blur any kind of financial datum line.” The “average” institution in the survey, the report said, finished its 1968 fiscal year with a surplus of $39,000. A year later it had a deficit of $20,000, which quintupled to $103,000 by the end of June, 1970. The expected deficit for the “average” institution in the current year is $115,000. On the average, institutions with the largest enrollments and the most graduate pro grams—and those In the upper Midwest, mid‐Atlantic and New England regions — have the greatest deficits. In 1967‐68, of the institutions surveyed, 187 ran deficits total ing $36‐million; in 1968‐69, 234 institutions had combined defi cits of $57‐million; and last year, 307 institutions accumu lated deficits of $86‐million. In 1970‐71, the report said, 261 institutions expect deficits to taling $87‐million. The median deficit for the institutions incurring deficits will be 4.2 per cent of current fund expenditures in 1970‐71, the report said.

205-> CON ED GETS STAY IN POLLUTION CASE
Consolidated Edison won a temporary restraining order yesterday allowing it to continue full use of its controversial coal‐burning Arthur Kill generator in Staten Island. State Supreme Court Justice John Cone signed the order, returnable tomorrow before Justice Murray Feiden in Brooklyn Supreme Court, requiring the city's Environmental Protection Administration and its Administrator, Jerome Kretchner, to show cause why the plant should be restricted to 200,000 kilowatts. Robert O. Lehrman, Con Edison vice president for public affairs, issued a statement saying the company did not question the city's authority to take appropriate action to protect the city's air quality. But a spokesman for the company said later that it considered the Nov. 16 E.P.A. ruling restricting the, 505,000 kilowatt plant to 40 per cent of its capacity “unreasonable and arbitrary.” The plant is to be shut down for 10 weeks beginning at the end of February for conversion to oil and standby coal use. The spokesman said the company sought the court action, rather than merely paying the fines until February, in order to proceed in a legal fashion, and to avoid the possibility of later criminal charges.

206-> African Organization, at U.N., ids Israelis Deny Territorial Aims
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Dec. 7—The Organization of African Unity urged Israel to day to clear the way for: a re sumption of negotiations with Egypt by reaffirming that she did not seek the annexation of Aral territory. If such a declaration is conveyed to Secretary General Thant, a spokesman for the organization told the General Assembly today, it would enable Dr. Gunnar V. Jarring, Mr. Thant's special representative, to resume his mediation efforts. The call was expressed in the report of the organization's 10‐country committee, which recently sent a delegation of four heads of state on a mediation mission to Israel and Egypt. The report was detailed before the General Assembly today by Amadou Karim Gaye, Senegal's Foreign Minister. Mr. Gaye was the only speaker on the Middle Eastern issue today. The debate was postponed to permit the Assembly to take up the Indian‐Pakistani war and is likely to be resumed tomorrow afternoon. For the moment at least, the Organization of African Unity mission has moved into center stage in the debate. Israel and Egypt have seized on it as a possible means of obtaining the kind of Assembly resolutions that they are seeking. The Israelis are hoping the Assembly will adopt a resolution along the lines the orginization's report, which does riot, specifically, call for an Israeli commitment to total withdrawal from territory occupied in the 1987 Arab‐Israeli war prior to negotiations. The Egyptians, however, are pressing the African countries to include such a provision in the, draft resolution that will probably be presented to the Assembly late tomorrow or Thursday. The African organization voted to attempt a mediation effort in the Middle East last June. A 10 country committee was appointed, which in turn sent a fourcmah delegation to both Egypt and Israel to determine their positions. From these soundings, Mr. Gaye told the Assembly today, “a number of positive elements” emerged. Both countries, he said, reaffirmed their willingness to make a formal peace agreement and to accept the resumption of, Dr. Jarring's efforts, stalled since last February, when he sought an Israeli commitment to withdraw to the pre‐1967 frontier. The principal obstacle to this, Mr. Gaye said, is the Arab “apprehension” over Israel's attitude toward the annexation of the territories occupied in 1967. Mr. Gaye said that in their meetings with the African delegation, the Israelis had formally declared that they had no intention to annex any Arab territories. This is the message that he said should be forwarded to Mr. Thant as a way of breaking the stalemate. In his assembly address yesterday, Foreign Minister Abba Eban of Israel did not go that far. Instead he made the more general observation that “Israel's policy is not annexation, but peace within secure and recognized boundaries to be determined by negotiation.” He also repeated the Israeli position that a return to the prewar borders was unacceptable from a security point of view.

207-> Foreign Investment Curb Is Indicated by Trudeau
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7—Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, assured by President Nixon that the United States did not wish to “gobble up” Canada, said today that it was up to Canadians to decide what type of foreign investment they would accept. Speaking at a news conference before his return to Ottawa, Mr. Trudeau made it clear in his replies to questions that the mounting Canadian concern over United States economic domination was the main reason for his request to confer with Mr. Nixon yesterday. His comments oh the need for balance between Canada's capital requirements and her sovereign interests were taken by American officials as a confirmation of reports that the Ottawa Government would soon announce selective restrictions on private investments from abroad. Mr. Trudeau said that Canada had made her decisions and that “soon we'll be prepared to discuss policy without an inferiority complex.” But the Prime Minister indicated that Mr. Nixon was sympathetic to the Canadian approach and, apparently, did not insist that Canada maintain an open‐door policy on entry of foreign capital. Mr. Trudeau said the President had told him Americans had no desire to see Canada develop as “a colony of the United States of America” but wanted her to shape her own “identity.” This, Mr. Trudeau said, was to him a “fantastically new statement” on American‐Canadian relations. He commented that “the President said some things to me which are unequalled by any other President in speaking about Canada.” The heart of the frequently expressed Canadian fear of American domination is that the United States would continue taking advantage of its huge trade deficit with Canada —about $2‐billion in 1970—to export investment capital on a massive scale. Canadians believe that Americans prefer to export capital when exports of goods are unfeasible. The United States direct private invest in Canada rose from $13‐billion in 1963 to $22.8‐billion in 1970. Canada is the largest single field of American investment and accounts for roughly a fourth of the total United States capital abroad. This investment trend, combined with United States restrictions on Canadian inports, under the Administration's n??w economic policy, are seen by Canada as threats to her economy. But Mr. Trudeau said Mr. Nixon had recalled the dependence of the United States on European investment after the first World War and had told him that, therefore, “We understand perfectly that the Canadians are in the same position and we will do everything to prevent them from feeling in any way that they are a colony of the United States of America.” The 45‐minute session was chiefly a dialogue, in English as well as in French, between Mr. Trudeau and Canadian newsmen. It was devoted entirely to economic relations with the United States. The White House meeting was the first in a series of consultations with allied leaders before the President's trips to China and the Soviet Union. He will fly Monday to the Azores to meet President Pompidou of France and Premier Marcello Caetano of Portugal. Later this month he will confer separately with Prime Minister Heath and the West German Chancellor, Willy Brandt. In January, Mr. Nixon will meet with Premier, Eisaku Sato of Japan.

208-> Design for Churchill Statue Shown
LONDON, March 16—The winning design in a compe tition for a statue of Sir Winston Churchill to stand in Parliament Square was unveiled today. The sculptor, Ivor Roberts‐Jones, shows the war leader bare‐headed, wearing a military‐style greatcoat and grasping a stick. Mr. Roberts‐Jones, a 57‐ year‐old Welshman who has paintings in the, Tate Gallery here, said he had tried to depict Sir Winston's “in domitable courage and com passion.” The 12‐foot bronze will stand on a nine‐foot plinth, The cost, about $72,000, has been met by public subscrip tion. The appeal was organ ized by an all‐party group of Members of Parliament. To be erected in 1973, it will be the first open‐air statue of Sir ‘Winston in the center of London. There are others in the House of Com mons; in the Guildhall in the City, the business section; at Woodford, his Parliamentary constituency on the outskirts of London, and at Chartwell, his home near Westerharn, Kent.

209-> Knesset Given, Bill to Help Soviet Jews Become Israelis
JERUSALEM, March 16 (Reu ters)—The Israeli Minister the Interior, Dr. Yosef Burg, today introduced a bill in the Knesset, or parliament, that would authorize him to grant Israeli citizenship to any Jew who expressed a desire to come to Israel. In presenting the measure Dr. Burg said that there were precedents in international law permitting the granting of tionality to a person specifically requesting it although still citizen of another country. The law would be intended primarily to help the Jews the Soviet Union in their forts to get permission to settle in Israel, he said.

211-> 3 KILLED IN BLAZE IN BROOKLYN HOUSE
At least three persons died last night in a fire in a three‐story frame house in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. Their identity was not immediately known. Patrolman John Medina who, with his partner, Patrolman Samuel 3. Oatis, was the first to reach the fire, was treated for severe smoke inhalation after he rescued four persons from the building. The two policemen discovered the fire, at 415 Bushwick Avenue, at about 11:45 P.M. When flames prevented them from entering the lower hallway, Patrolman Medina, with a boost from his partner, climbed to the second floor, where he rescued one couple. He then climbed to the top floor and passed down two young girls to his partner before collapsing.

212-> Route II, Intrepid Tie at Harrisburg For Jump Laurels
HARRISBURG, Pa., Oct. 16— Joe Fargis, one of the rookie United States Equestrian Team riders, and Moffat Dunlap, an experienced 30‐year‐old were involved in an unusual tie to night in the first international jumping event of the Pennsyl vania National horse show. Fargis, upon Bonte II in the jumpoff, and Dunlap, aboard Intrepid, both were clean and were clocked in’ the idenntical time, 24.7 seconds, for the eight jumps. Customarily, the time in jumpoffs is figured in hun dredths of seconds, but inter national rules specify that only tenths may be used. So the two riders shared the top prize. Only six horses were clean the first time round. Even that was unusual because the class was a relatively easy one. The official name, the international preliminary, indicated that it was to be used primarily as warmup for the difficult classes ahead. The others who went fault less in the first round were three horses from the United States Equestrian team, Good Twist, handled by Frank Cha pot; Blue Plum, ridden by Far gis, and Sloopy, piloted by Neal Shapiro, and the Canadian Equestrian Team's Australis, ridden by Barbara Simpson. Good Twist was clean in the jumpoff, too, and finished in third place. His time was 25.2. Sloopy and Blue Plum each had four faults and Australis, a former American Horse Show Association national high‐pdint open jumper champion, had eight faults. “I didn't know how fast the horse could go,” said Fargis later. “This is the first time I've been in an indoor inter national competition and one thing I found out is that you've got to think a lot quicker in doors than outdoors. ‘ War Dress, owned by Mrs. A.C. Randolph of Upperville, Va., and handled by Charlie Weaver, captured the small junior working hunter title. The 6‐year‐old chestnut mare won the same championship at the National Horse Show last year. “Last year was my first try in the National,” Weaver said, “and to say that I was nervous would be the understatement of the year. This time around be more relaxed. “Any of a dozen good horses could win the junior hunter championship in the National. It all depends on the kind of (form the horse is in that par ticular day.” This is Weaver's final year as a junior and he plans to keep riding for Mrs. Randolph. Sarah Hoschwender's Fair Judy finished as reserve cham pion to War Dress, with points. Fair, won a class and had a tird‐place ribbon. Brenda Watson's Miss Rustler and Joanie Wels's and Robin Ann Rost's Speechmaker King's Way, captured the other three classes in the division.

Pucinski, Demo crat, of Illinois, chairman of a House education subcommittee. Mr. Pucinski introduced a bill that would lead to the Federal Government's financing one‐ third of the cost of such educa tion by 1972. The present Fed eral share is about 6 per cent.

214-> U.S. OFFICER HEED FOR WAR PROTEST
LONDON, June 7—An Air Force officer, placed under re striction on the eve of his de parture for the United States and discharge, said today he expected to face a court‐martial for taking part in a protest against the Vietnam war. The officer, Capt. Thomas S. Culver, a member of the Judge Advocate General's staff at Lakenheath Air Force Base, was ordered confined to the base Thursday night, three days af ter he participated in a brief antiwar protest outside the American Embassy in London. During the protest, in which 300 servicemen were involved, antiwar petitions with 1,000 signatures were handed into the embassy. “I was the senior man there, probably the only officer, and that's why they're doing this,” Captain Culver said today ina telephone interview from his quarters at the base, 82 miles from London. “I expect them to start a court‐martial on this.” The officer, and other serv icemen who took part in the protest, emphasized at the time that they were merely hand ing in petitions to the embassy and not participating in a dem onstration. They said that the petitions, addressed to the Pres ident and Congress, were legal under Air Force regulations that state: “Military personnel may petition or present a griev ance to any member of Con gress without fear of reprisal.” Captain Culver said that vio lation of an Air Force regula tion forbidding demonstrations overseas carries a maximum penalty of two years hard la bor and a dishonorable dis charge. Air Force spokesman at the base as well as at South Ruis lip Air Station, headquarters of the Third United States Air Force, said the restriction was ordered by the Lakenheath base commander “pending an inves tigation.” There was no further comment. Captain Culver was sched uled to leave for the United States Friday for immediate dis charge at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey. The 32‐ year‐old officer has served six years in the Air Force, includ ing one year in South Vietnam. Captain Culver is a 1960 graduate of Columbia Univer sity, where he earned a Bache lor of Arts degree. He studied law at Stanford University and received a diploma in criminology at Cambridge University in England. He joined the Air Force on a direct commission as a lawyer. In discussing his reasons for leaving the Air Force, Captain Culver, a bachelor, said to night: “I don't like the Air Force any more. I found I wasn't especially happy in the military community. I wanted to stay in England as a civilian lawyer.” The officer, who grew up in Westfield, N. J., said he had been told in a letter from his acting wing commander, Col. Jerome F. Naleid, that the Air Force was investigating pos sible breaches of the regula tions that forbid demonstra tions of servicemen overseas. The letter was sent in response to a request by Captain Culver asking the reason for the re strictions. “If I am court‐martialed, this will be an important test case,” he said. “A verdict of not guilty would mean that Amer ican servicemen all over the world—Vietnam, Thailand, Ger many—will be joining in anti war marches.” The antiwar movement among Air Farce enlisted men in Bri tain, spurred by American stu dents at Oxford, Cambridge and the London School of Eco nomics, includes an under ground newspaper called Peace —People Emerging Against Corrupt Establishment. Several civilian members of its staff were scheduled to distribute leaflets tomorrow outside bases protesting Captain Culver's con finement. There are more than 25,000 United States military person nel in Britain, including 22,000 Air Force men, 3,000 Navy men and about 300 Army men.

215-> Kleindienst Assails Boggs; Invites Inquiry Into F.B.I.
WASHINGTON, April 7—Richard G. Hleindienst, Deputy Attorney General, asserted today that Representative Hale Boggs of Louisiana was “either sick or not in possession of his faculties” when he charged that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had tapped Congressmen's telephones and called for the resignation of J. Edgar Hoover. Mr. Kleindienst said he would “welcome an investigation by the responsible members of Congress” of the allegations made on the House floor Monday by Mr. Boggs, the Democratic whip. “Unless that is done or Mr. Boggs retracts his statements,” Mr. Kleindienst said, “you have hanging in the air the charge itself — wiretapping the telephones of members of Congress.” Representative Bella S. Abzug, Democrat of Manhattan, filed a resolution in the House today calling on the Judiciary Coinmittee to conduct “a full and complete investigation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation” that would include “investigation of the ability of the director,” Mr. Hoover. Representative Emanuel Celler, Dembcrat of Brooklyn, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said that he would consult with members of the committee about the possibility of holding hearings. Mrs. Abzug said: “Recent events have made it starkly evident that the F.B.I., busy investigating others, needs someone to investigate it. For example, in recent months we have observed charges [by Mr. Hoover] against leaders of the Catholic antiwar movement originate in testimony made before committees of Congress and justified only by an indictment returned two months later.” “Stolen F.B.I. files have shown us that the agency routinely maintains large and inaccurate dossiers on special groups and individuals—notably the peace movement and black activist groups — whose politics the director finds personally offensive,” Mrs. Abzug said. “These incidents show us that the F.B.I. may be slowly but inexorably invading the privacy, the constitutional freedoms and the peace of mind of us all,” she added. Representative Charles H. Wilson, Democrat of California, introduced a bill that would set a 10‐year limit on the tenure of the head of the bureau and would set a mandatory, retirement age of 65. The prohibition against any public servant amassing “dynastic or dictatorial powers” is one of the basic traditions of this country, Mr. Wilson said. “I see no justification for exempting an F.B.I. director from such traditions.” Representative Wayne L. Hays, Democrat of Ohio, announced this afternoon after consulting with Speaker Carl Albert of Oklahoma that the House Administration Committee, which he heads, would hire an independent company to check Congressmen's telephones periodically to see if they were tapped. And Representative John J. Rooney, Democrat of Brooklyn, released testimony by Mr. Hoover before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Justice, Commerce and the Judiciary. Mr. Hoover told the subcommittee Mardi 17: “We have never tapped the telephone of any Congressman or any Senator since I have been director of the bureau.” In the Senate, the Democratic whip, Robert C. Byrd of West Virinia, challenged Mr. Boggs to produce his evidence. “I think there is a good bit of imagination involved here,” Mr. Byrd said. “If he has good, substantial, bona fide evidence, he should reveal it.” Mr. Boggs reiterated his intention to disclose his evidence after the House returns from its Easter recess April 19. At the White House, Ronald L. Ziegler, the President's press secretary, was asked if Mr. Hoover still enjoyed the full confidence of the President. “Yes,” Mr. Ziegler replied. A White House official disclosed that Mr. Boggs's charges were discussed for 25 minutes yesterday at the daily morning meeting of top White House staff members. He indicated that the discussion had concentrated on whether Mr. Boggs had any evidence to support his charges.

216-> Police in Windsor, Ont., Halt Protesters Against Blast
WINDSOR, Ontario, Nov. 7 (Canadian Press) — Policemen wearing riot helmets and carrying billy clubs stopped 1,500 demonstrators against the United States Amchitka nuclear blast from marching yesterday on to the Ambassador Bridge. Fourteen of the protesters were arrested and later released during a two‐hour protest on the Canadian access ramp to the bridge, which links Detroit and Windsor. Most of the arrests were made when about a dozen soft drink bottles were thrown by the demonstrators and when some broke through a line set up by student marshals for the protest.

217-> Trouble for the Dollar
A new crisis for the dollar may be in the making. Last year the United States ran a $10‐billion balance‐of payments deficit in its settlements with foreign govern ments—the biggest such deficit in American history. This year another big deficit is likely, though probably not as large. These deficits have meant a transfer far more dollars abroad than foreigners want to hold, but they have not been able to do much about because the dollar is an official reserve currency used by this country to settle its foreign accounts. Despite the huge deficit last Year, the international monetary scene was relatively quiet because foreign dollar holders were able to earn a high return on their dollars by lending them to United States borrowers. At the height of the liquidity crisis here, interest rates on Eurodollars soared to more than 12 per cent. Lately Eurodollar rates have fallen to just above 5 per cent, but with American banks “awash with liquidity,” in the phrase of Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur F. Burns, the demand for Eurodollars in this country has evap orated. In fact, Eurodollars are flowing back to Europe in enormous volume, since European interest rates are above those here. Pressures on European governments to do something about excessive dollar, flows are increasing from pro tectionist business interests abroad—interests that would just as soon exclude American competition from their markets in any case. Concerns about a European recession are intensifying these pressures. Under these circumstances, it would be foolish for the United. States to adopt—or seem to adopt—a policy of “benign neglect” of its balance of payments. It is doubtless true, as the Joint Economic Committee said this week, that the United States must give priority to concerns about the domestic economy to achieve high employment and price stability. But the crisis necessi tates practical steps to reduce the payments deficit and make clear this country's determination to solve the problems it creates for others. The first necessity is to get United States inflation under better control—for both domestic and interna tional reasons. This means not only avoiding excessive monetary stimulation but adopting a broad‐based and effective incomes policy. If further stimulus proves needed, it would be better to emphasize fiscal measures—expenditure increases or tax reduction—than still looser money, which could further depress interest rates and accelerate capital flows abroad. The United States should also soak up some of the, surplus dollars overseas. It has already been doing a moderate amount of that through Export‐Import Bank borrowings of dollars in Europe. Washington can use some of its gold and Special Drawing Rights to this end. However, a better mechanism is needed to recirculate short‐term capital flowing to and from nations. Crises are bred by hot‐money movements. Clearly, the adjustment problem should not rest solely on the American side. Governments with heavy and con tinuous payments surpluses should upvalue their cur rencies. Perhaps the most conspicuously undervalued currency today is the Japanese yen. Greater exchange‐rate flexibility could make a major contribution to balance; widening the bands within which national currencies may fluctuate relative to each other would do much to prevent American economic fluctuations from whipsawing other economies. Although the balance of payments cannot dominate either domestic economic policy or foreign policy, there is one great step this country could take that would serve all three purposes: Reduce its enormous outflow of expenditures for the war in Indochina. Cutting un needed military outlays in other areas would serve the same purposes.

218-> State Receives Grant to Hire More Minority Prison Guards
Governor Rockefeller announced yesterday a new Federal grant to the state's Department of Correctional Servnumber of black and Puerto Rican prison guards. The $388,210 grant is intended to supplement the approximately $3‐million already authorized by the department to hire 300 new correction officers. It would set up new recruiting measures to insure that, of the new officers, “as many as humanly possible” are blacks and Puerto Ricans, a state official said yesterday. Of the, state's 4,000 correction officers, about 240 are blacks or Puerto Ricans. One of the demands of rebellious prisoners at the Attica Correctional Facility, last September was that this number of minority group workers be increased. Archibald R. Murray, aadministrator of the State Division of Crimanal. Justice, said yesterday that the Attica revolt in which 43 persons were killed, had “some influence” on the new grant, but that initial steps to approve it had begun late last year. The grant for the, new hiring was part of a $8.7‐million sum announced by the Governor. Of this, $3,875,628 was earmarked for the Corrections Department for such purposes as improved food and clothing for inmates, which was also demanded by the Attica inmates. The remaining portion of the $8.7‐milliem was announced for various localities hr the state, including $2.3‐million for New York City, The Federal total is part of a $37.5‐millioti grant due New York State this fiscal year under the Federal Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. In addition to the recruitment program, the money for the Corrections Department is to be used to provide more meat, fruit and vegetables for inmates; to purchase clothing for prisoners from private sources rather than have it made by the inmates themselves; to install a metal detector system for correctional facilities, and to develop community‐based halfway houses for prisoners. The money for New York City is to be used for several programs, including one to hire law students for the Legal Aid Society. Another program, Mr. Murray said, would provide for “deferred prosecution” of female offenders in much the same way that judges divert youthful offenders from a trial if it is felt that other supervision by court officers might best “save” or reform them. The city's grant will also go to establish a new office of Consumer Affaris in South Jamaica, Queens, and to hire prosecutors specializing in consumer protection for the Manhattan and Queens District Attorneys to work with the new office and another on the Lower East Side.

219-> Soviet Space Station Spurs Shuttle Plan
WASHINGTON, June 7—The orbiting of the Soviet Union's huge new space station has giv en an unexpected boost to backers of the American space shuttle, the multibillion ‐ dollar gleam in the eye of the space agency and the aerospace in dustry. The shuttle is viewed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as the transpor tation system necessary as a forerunner to the construction in orbit by the end of the dec ade of an American space sta tion that would carry a dozen crewmen. Current planning at NASA even calls for a much larger station manned by 50 astro nauts and scientists in the nine‐ teen eighties. Opponents of these projects, which would cost tens of bil lions of dollars, have slowly been gathering support since the heady days of the first moon landing. Yet it has been almost a cliché here that the threat of a Soviet space ex travaganza is enough to shore up waning support for the American space programs. Shuttle supporters won an other round of Congressional infighting last week, but the battle to get the mammoth project off the drawing board and onto the launching pad is far from over. In fact, the battle could, with justification, be said to have hardly started, because the amount of Federal funds already spent on the shuttle— $150‐million—is perhaps only 1 per cent of the program's final research, development, testing and engineering costs. Late this summer the Na tional Aeronautics and Space Administration is due to select the winner of the design com petition for the huge liquid hydrogen‐liquid oxygen engines for the shuttle. This translates to a contract of at least $600‐ million for the financially hard‐pressed aerospace com pany that is chosen. “But we're not so sure that the pot of gold is forthcom ing,” said one NASA official working on the space shuttle program. “It's all contingent on our friends on Capitol Hill.” Last Thursday, Congressional supporters of the program, which is designed to create a space transportation system that would last 25 years, shouted down attempts on the House floor to chop $125‐ million in development funds for the coming fiscal year. The money would be used to design, build and test the gigantic piggyback spacecraft, which really would be two vehicles in one, resembling in size a Boeing 747 Jumbojet mated to the C‐5A, the world's largest plane. The larger vehicle would act as a booster to blast the combination through the atmosphere and place the sec ond craft, known as the Orbiter, in position about 100 miles aloft. After they separated, the larger booster would glide back to earth to land on an airfield like a plane. The smaller Orbiter, carrying crews and supplies, would stay aloft for up to 10 days either to launch satellites or rendezvous with other spacecraft. It, too, would then return to earth in the conventional fashion of a plane. The space agency expects to award the development and production contracts for the en tire vehicle next spring. The three contending teams are headed by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation the North American Rockwell Corpora tion and the Grumman Aero space Corporation. To Representative Bella S. Abzug, Democrat of Manhat tan, the idea of constructing this futuristic system is absurd. She offered an amendment to the space authorization bill that would have deleted the funds, reasoning that the na tional scientific effort should concentrate first on the elimina tion of disease, hunger and poor housing. Although her proposal was soundly defeated, shuttle oppo nents in the Senate also have their chance to whittle the shuttle funds. In addition, the bills merely authorize money; the Nixon Administration, which is beset with its own financial problems, might not choose to spend it. The movement to scuttle the shuttle is hardly as noteworthy as the monumental squabble to shoot down the supersonic transport, yet the behind‐the scenes infighting is both in tense and unending—and there is far more money at stake. The chief Congressional op ponent of the shuttle, Senator Walter F. Mondale, Democrat of Minnesota, has in recent weeks renewed his charges that the shuttle would be a colossal boondoggle that would cost the taxpayers from $12‐billion to 10 times that amount, defend ing on what was built, how long it was used, and the ul timate, size of the space pro gram. Insisting that the current request for shuttle funds is “only the tip of the iceberg,” Mr. Mondale distributed a re port, critical of the shuttle, that was prepared for the Air Force last year by the Rand Corporation, a reputable and influential “think tank” in Cali fornia. The Rand study sought to answer the, primary question surrounding the shuttle con cept: Could its admittedly high cost be offset by future sav ings in space operations? The shuttle envisions reuse of the hardware for as many as 100 space flights. In contrast, booster rockets and spacecraft currently are only used once, then discarded. During an Apollo fight to the moon, for example, the non recoverable costs of the Saturn V booster and the command and service modules are sev eral hundred million dollars. Such giddy programs as manned flights to Mars and an earth orbital space station carrying a crew of 50 men would be impossible without the shuttle. But the Rand report stated: “Although [the shuttle] has been recommended for develop ment by the President's Space Task Group, that development is not easy to justfy. Based on traffic rates derived from con servative options in the Space Task Group and Department of Defense plans, this space shut tle, with an estimated [develop ment] cost of almost $9‐billion, could show a net transporta tion cost saving of $2.8‐billion by 1990.” Release of the Rand report triggered almost immediate re sponses from Senator Clinton P. Anderson, the Democrat from New Mexico who, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sci ences, is the shuttle's champion in. Congress, and Dr. James C. Fletcher, the NASA adminis trator. They sought to trump the Rand report by stating that was “a relatively low‐level ef fort based on data and assump tions that are about two years old.” They contended that was best to reserve judgement on the shuttle pending comple tion of a much larger $600,000 survey being prepared by math ematica, Inc., a Princeton, N. J., research group. Last March, Mathematica produced for NASA a 600‐page interim report entitled “Benefit Cost Analysis of New Space Transportation Systems.” A longer and final version is due this summer. Development of the shuttle hinges on the attitude of the Administration and Congress toward a larger space program. Yet the Administration already has reduced the military and civilian space budgets, while Congressional opposition has increased in the past year. The shuttle originally was due to fly in 1976, a date that now looks wildly optimistic. Russell D. Shaver, the prin cipal author of the Rand report, put it this way: “I think it will fly someday, but not in this decade. The program is just too expensive right now.”

220-> Ulster Leader in London Seeking Additional Troops
LONDON, March 16—The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Maj. James D. Chi chester‐Clark, unexpectedly flew into London today to plead for more British troops to save his government. The Ulster leader met with the Home Secretary, Reginald Maudling, and the Defense Minister, Lord Carrington. He then went to 10 Downing Street and talked with Prime Minister Heath for almost two hours. No statement was issued. According to informed sources in Belfast, however, Major Chichester‐Clark told Mr. Heath he might be forced to resign within days unless London au thorized tougher measures against Irish terrorists operat ing among Northern Ireland's Roman Catholic minority. Ulster's militant Protestants, who themselves have engaged in anti‐Catholic violence in the past, are enraged that the 8,200‐ man British garrison has not responded more forcefully to recent political murders, gang land killings, arson, explosions and street attacks. Their resentment turned to fury last week with the slaying of three British soldiers on duty in Northern Ireland. There are incidents almost nightly in Belfast, the gloomy provincial capital. In the recent violence, various factions of the Irish Republican Army have generally been blamed. The ille gal guerrilla group seeks to unite Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic to the south. Outraged by new violence, many Protestants, including some relative liberals, are de manding more troops, a re armed police force, harsher tac tics and activation of the Spe cial Powers Act to intern sus pects without trial. The British Government and, until recently, the semi‐auton omous Northern Ireland Gov ernment as well, have shied from such measures for fear of alienating the many Catholic moderates and for fear of pro voking I.R.A. counterattacks. Major Chichester‐Clark, how ever, has lost the support of the Protestant rank and file, and is threatened with censure by his own party. He had earlier commanded only the most grudging backing for the program of social and political reform he is pursuing, with London's insistence, to meet the grievances of the Catholics. As the effects of the Ulster crisis spread outside Northern Ireland, today was an occasion of high emotion. In Scotland, funerals were held for the three young soldiers who were apparently lured from a Belfast pub last week and slain on a lonely road. Their killers have not been found. Some 14,000 mourners lined the cold streets in the west coast town of Ayr and 3,000 crowded around the grave where two brothers, John and Joseph McCaig, 17 and 18 years old, were buried. As the body of 23‐year‐old Dougald McCaughey rested at a crematory in Glasgow, the regimental chaplain, the Rev. James Lawson, said his death was “something that has so moved the hearts and con scences of many, many peo ple so perhaps even peace in the troubled and divided land of Ireland may have been brought a step nearer.” In Belfast, Union Jacks were at half‐staff and the center of the city was paralyzed as an unexpectedly large crowd of 10,000 swarmed around the baroque City Hall to lay wreaths. But the memorial demonstra tion took on militant overtones with a brief service by the Rev. Ian Paisley, the extremist Protestant leader. Protestant workers from the Belfast ship yard also marched, and they promised another demonstra tion on Thursday. The recent events have brought despair to those who hoped that Northern Ireland might settle down to a peaceful existence. The problems now seem intractable. The military situation ap pears to have degenerated into a war of attrition, with what are presumably I.R.A. units try ing to disrupt normal life and exhaust British interest in keep‐, ing the six counties of Northern Ireland a part of the United Kingdom. Further killings could well stir British revulsion for further involvement anywhere in Ire land. This was the successful tactic of the original I.R.A. from 1916 to 1921, when Brit ain partitioned Ireland, yielding the major portion to its mainly Catholic inhabitants. The objective of Major Chi chester‐Clark and his fellow Protestants is to keep Ulster separate from the Irish Repub lic and still a part of Britain. London has repeatedly prom ised it would never consider an end to partition without the consent of the Protestant‐dom inated Parliament in Belfast. But London has also insisted that Belfast be scrupulously fair in its dealings with the Catholic minority. With Lon don's prodding, and spurred by the civil rights demonstrations of 1968‐69, Belfast has moved to erase discrimination in jobs, housing and voting rights and to reorganize and disarm the police and paramilitary forces. But to many Catholics, the civil rights reforms seem im material. In a province of chronic economic recession and high unemployment, the lot of working men, both Catholic an Protestant, is difficult. Catholics complain that the reforms are superficial and show no real change in Protes tant attitudes and that Catho lics are forever consigned, by sectarian voting patterns, to be the political minority. In such an atmosphere, the I.R.A. revives the dreams of a united Catholic Ireland.

221-> East Pakistan Area Search Finds No Cyclone Fatalities
DACCA, Pakistan, Nov. 7—Pakistani authorities said today that apparently no one on the East Pakistani mainland was killed by the cyclone that sideswiped the coastal region yesterday before passing into Burma. The statement was issued following an aerial inspection of the area. The cyclone is believed to have caused the deaths of several hundred fishermen in the Bay of Bengal and to have done extensive damage to crops and livestock in the southern parts of East Pakistan and on some offshore islands.

223-> Letters to the Editor
I was recently chosen as one of the few winners of a National Science Foundation graduate fellowship. I say few not as a boast, but rather as cry of despair. I wish I were a mem ber of a group not quite so select. To the Editor: Many hundreds of other students deserve these fellowships but were rejected because of lack of funds. Some will be able to continue their graduate studies without the awards, but many will not. Scores of budding young sci entists will be lost to our nation forever. Someday this war‐induced recession will end; some day we will need these scientists, but they will not be there. In the name of economy, they will be just another set of victims of our warped set of priorities. Perhaps if we raise our voices at this time, further efforts to emasculate the N.S.F. program can be stopped. As a possible source of funds, perhaps Mr. Nixon will be willing to part with the millions he was ready to waste on the SST. The time to act is now. New York, March 24, 1971

224-> British Embassy Under Fire
LONDON, July 23 (AP)—A Foreign Office spokesman said that the British Embassy in Khartoum came under tank fire today but that the four persons inside were unhurt. Reports reaching diplomatic quarters here said heavy tank fire broke out near the Presi dential Palace in Khartoum. But, it was said, the tanks ap parently were shooting at real or imagined snipers on roofs. The reports said the capital was quiet by late afternoon.

225-> Parking Fees Are Doubled Near Cleveland Stadium
CLEVELAND (UPI) — It will cost baseball and football fans an extra $1 this year to park at the municipal stadium. The Board of Control has voted to double the fee—from $1 to $2—in the contract it will let to the highest bidder this spring. The increase affects all four lots around the stadium owned by the city. City officials estimated the increase would bring in an additional $50,000 a year. They said revenue fell off last year because of a drop in attendance at the Cleveland Indians' base ball games.

226-> TEMPLE DEFEATS N.Y.U. BY 90‐66
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 13— Temple University survived a surge in the second half by New York University and defeated the Violets, 90.65, before 9,200 fans at the Palestra tonight. In the second game of a dou ble‐header, La Salle defeated Villanova, 73‐69. The Owls built a half‐time advantage of 43‐26 with a tena cious 3‐2 zone defense that forced 15 N.Y.U. turnovers. But after intermission, the Violets regained their composure and cut the deficit to 61‐53 with eight minutes and 11 seconds left in the game. Andy Chap pell and Pat Costigan sparked N.Y.U. in the second half with 13 and 10 points, respectively. Temple outscored N.Y.U., 29 12, the rest of the way to gain its 12th victory against 10 de feats. Paul Collins had 19 points for Temple, while Chappell had 19 for the Violets. N.Y.U. now has a won‐lost record of 4–14.

227-> Vols' Quintet Paints the Town Orange
KNOXVILLE, Feb. 13— This is Big Orange Country. Look around this city and as far as you can see the scene is a sparkling orange. This bright and appealing image is the brainchild of one man, Ray Mears. The personable Mears is the basketball coach of the University of Tennessee, the 15th‐ranked team in the coun try. In his nine years here, the Volunteers have won 160 games and lost only 65. In 15 years as a college coach here and at Wittenberg (Ohio), Mears's won‐lost rec ord is 281‐89 (or a percent age of .761). Among active coaches, only Adolph Rupp of Ken tucky and John Wooden of the University of California, Los Angeles, have better records. Tennessee, long noted for its defensive excellence, is the only team in the South eastern Conference to have successfully foiled Johnny Neumann, Mississippi's soph more sensation. Against Ten nessee this week, Neumann was held to 22 points, half his season average, as the Volunteers triumphed, 80‐74. “Our strategy against Neumann was a Y‐shaped zone with Jimmy England chasing Neumann man to man,” said Mears. “The de fense was designed to neu tralize Mississippi's offensive strength.” “I consider Tennessee's defense a compliment,” said Neumann. “They just played a superb game. They con trolled the tempo the way they wanted to.” Tennessee has won 15 of its first 19 games, including 8 of 11 in the conference, good for a share of second place. It inflicted Kentucky's only league defeat, a .75‐71 decision Jan. 16. The Volunteers are a small team, with no starter taller than 6 feet 5 inches. They have overcome this disadvantage through exten sive preparation and Mears's ability as a tactician. Three players spearhead Tennessee's quick ‐ broak of fense. Jimmy England, the captain and playmaker, is described by Rupp as “one of the best shooters I've seen under heavy defensive pres sure.” Don Johnson is the leading rebounder and sopho more Mike Edwards shoots well from a long range. Mears has organized fans into an Orange Tie Club and added a pep band. He has in troduced a pregame show featuring ball‐handling drills that would do justice to the Harlem Globetrotters. Roger Peitz, a reserve forward, per forms a baalncing and jug gling act while riding a uni cycle. In the last 10 years Ten nessee teams have won a to tal el 23 championships in all sports. The athletic facili ties arc rated anion„ the fin est in the country. The Volunteers played in the National Invitation Tour nament two years ago and placed third. Mears hopes to bring his team back to Mad ison Square Garden for next month's tourney. “New York,” said England, “is the place to play basketball.”

228-> About Archie
TO THE EDITOR: The Times is to be congratulated for running Laura Z. Hobson's gutsy and right‐on piece on “All in the Family.” Mrs. Hobson is to be congratulated for her persistence in pursuing the subject far beyond the customary superficial level of analysis. Eldridge Cleaver's most famous remark reminds us that we are either part of the solution or we are part of the problem. Well, clearly the character Archie Bunker symbolizes is part of the problem in America, and “All in the Family,” by making bigotry seem funny when it is tragic, and innocuous when it is pure social poison, is part of the problem too. And the society that suffers from reinforcing this bigotry and racism is not just our own, for surely Archie Bunker and Lieut. William Calley are kin. There's another aspect to the program touched on but not explored by Mrs. Hobson's article—Bunker's “lower‐classness.” Isn't it rather perverse to create a program which allows that class which represents the mass audience —also the primary source of consumer spending—to laugh at that minority class of “declassé” Americans Bunker represents? And Isn't it also wrong to create a program that allows the middle class to laugh at lower‐class racism and bigotry and pretend that its own racism and bigotry, which is only more subtle, doen's exist?

229-> Music
AST season the Central Presbyterian Church put on a paid professional series of concerts in Its sanctuary. It was believed to be the first of its kind. Churches and temples have been used for standard concert series, particularly in cities and towns where they provided the best auditoriums. The same institutions also give programs of sacred music, usually on Friday evenings or Sunday afternoons, the fee being whatever the visitor chooses to give. These are different matters. Central Presbyterian's series proved to be a big success, with capacity audiences and extra performances. The programs, devised by the church's music director, Richard Westenburg, were made up of works written for presentation in a church. They were mostly choral, with an occasional organ concerto thrown in. It was, as Westenburg said, important that these works be heard in the kind of surroundings they were meant for. Central Presbyterian now seems to be the forerunner of a trend. This season, in addition to a second series there, one will be given at All Saints Church and one at Grace Church. Central Presbyterian's will open on Oct. 15. Eight programs are scheduled for Monday nights throughout the season, with four of them being repeated the following Tuesday nights. The works will range from Hovhaness's Symphony No. 12 (Choral Psalm No. 23) through Charles Ives's works for chorus to the Duruflé Requiem. At All Saints Church there will be six Tuesday night concerts in October and November devoted to Handel's “royal” music. This will include the 12 Chandos anthems, a few other anthems and organ concertos (some of the latter to be played on a harpsichord). Dennis G. Michno was inspired to present these programs—the first will be on Oct. 12—by two considerations. “I've always had a mania to conduct the Chandos anthems,” he says. “Last May I became music director at All Saints, and I found musicians of Lop‐notch quality.” The two factors decided Michno to present his series. He is planning two similar series later on, one of chamber music in midseason and one of Messiaen's music in the spring. Works by Haydn—masses, the “Stabat Mater,” a “Te Deum,” concertos for organ and for trumpet—will be performed at Grace Church on four Friday nights, beginning Oct. 29. The series is being sponsored by the Amor Artis Chorale and Orchestra, whose conductor is Johannes Somary. The Amor Artis has functioned in concert halls in the past, but Somary would like to get the concerts, sacred in content, back into the church. (He is music director at the Church of Our Savior, but he prefers the acoustics of Grace Church.) Amor Artis is I o years old, and Somary says, “Our audiences have followed us from Town Hall to Alice Tully Hall. Hopefully, they will follow us again to the Village,” Grace Church being at Broadway and 10th Street. “Our programs will last from 7:30 to 9, without intermission, and we hope they will attract the young.” Although Ernst Maerzendorfer has been a regular conductor for the Vienna State Opera for eight years and is constantly touring with a chamber ensemble, he has found time for two special projects. One was worked out with the Vienna Chamber Orchestra, which he will conduct at the Hunter College Playhouse on Tuesday night. This is the first complete recording of all 107 symphonies of Haydn, under the sponsorship of the Musical Heritage Society, an American organization. “It took us four years,” Maerzendorfer said the other day. “We began it as soon as Robhin Landon, the Haydn authority, finished his edition of the symphonies, Most of them were not in anybody's repertoire, and those that were often differed in scoring from standard editions. This mean a lot of study on my part and extra rehearsals for the players.” Maerzendorfer also spent three summers completing the Finale, or fourth movement, of Bruckner's Ninth Symphony. He was goaded into this by a music critic in Graz, Austria, who thought that “one of these lazy conductors” should try to finish it. “When I examined what was left,” Maerzendorfer said, “I found 150 pages of the Finale completed, and some indications of what the ending was to be like. I was convinced that Bruckner's conception of the work had been completed, but that he had just not had time to set it down before he died. The movement is quite modern, going towards Schoenberg. It moves from a spirit of pessimism to one of near serenity at the end. It lakes 25 minutes.” The conductor has performed the movement by itself a few times. They have inspired him to make changes, and he is not yet ready to publish the result. He expects he will be ready by 1974, when he plans to conduct the symphony in its entirety in Vienna. Not a project but an accumulation of events has led to his having conducted all but one of the Richard Strauss operas, probably something of a record. The exception is, oddly enough, “Die Frau ohne Schatten.” Maerzendorfer was a pupil of Clemens Krauss, Strauss's favorite conductor in the latter part of the composer's career, and the younger man became a close friend of the family. New Yorkers will hear an echo of the Newport Music Festival on Oct. 27, when the Bergson Trio makes its local debut in Alice Tully Hall. The ensemble is made up of Toni Rapport, violinist; Leshek Zavistovsky, cellist, and Flavio Varani, pianist. They joined forces at the first Newport festival in 1969, and they have played there the following two summers. They took their name from the Polish composer Michael Bergson, because it was his “Morceau de Salon” that introduced them to the Newport audiences. Although they are, respectively, from the United States, Poland and Brazil, they all have degrees from American conservatories. They share an interest in the neglected 19th‐century literature that makes up the programs of the Newport festivals. This explains their willingness to explore and learn countless works no similar ensemble knows. They will play here pieces that they first presented at Newport, by Arthur Foote, George Osborne and Hans von Bronsart Anyone interested in Romantic music owes it to himself to attend their concert.

230-> Democrats Say Opposition to Butz Has Risen to 41 Votes in Senate, but G.O.P. Predicts Confirmation
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30—The number of Senate votes against the confirmation of Dr. Earl L. Butz as Secretary of Agricul ture grew to 41 today, accord ing to some Democratic calcu lations, but Republicans said they expected the nomination to be approved. Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana, the Senate Democrat ic leader, said Dr. Butz was “in trouble.” He did not predict the outcome in the Senate, which may take up the nomi nation tomorrow. The vote may not come until Thursday. The Senate has al lotted eight hours for debate after it finishes work on wage and price legislation. Demo cratic opponents of Dr. Butz disclaimed any intention of filibustering, but they said they expected to talk at some length on Dr. Butz's view of agricul tural policies and his “unsym pathetic” attitude toward inde pendent family farmers. Democrats leading the op position viewed the vote as possibly hinging on undecided Senators and absentees. Senator Hugh Scott of Penn sylvania, the Senate Republican leader, said a White House head count indicated that Dr. Butz was safe and that the Democrats needed at least 10 to 12 more votes to defeat the nomination. The two Democratic Sena tors from Dr. Butz's home state of Indiana split on confirma tion. Senator Vance Hartke an nounced that he would vote against confirmation, while Sen ator Birch Bayh said he would vote to confirm. Senator Hartke said his de cision to oppose Dr. Butz, whom he called a personal friend, was one of the most difficult of his political career. He said that perhaps the most important consideration was that the Purdue University dean “simply does not have the confidence of America's farm ers at this critical hour in their struggle for survival.” Senator Bayh said Dr. Butz should not be the focal point for the failure of President Nixon's farm policy, which the Senator said had brougnt lower farm prices at a time when farm costs were rising. The Senate, he said, has followed the practice of giving the President the utmost lee way in appointing individuals who serve him directly. “It is not the Senate's re sponsibility to select Cabinet officers or pass on their views unless there is a flagrant abuse of the public interest,” he said. “I can find no such abuse in the present instance.” Senators from farm states, particularly those in the big corn‐hog‐cattle belt of the Middle West, said that mail opposing Dr. Butz continued to run heavy. Representatives of organized labor, the civil rights move ment, the poor, consumers and conservation organizations also urged Senators to vote against Dr. Butz on the ground that he was not sympathetic to pro grams to feed the poor and hungry and favored big busi ness in agriculture. They hoped to sway some urban Senators. Republican sources said that the influence of Senator James B. Pearson, Republican of Kan sas, might have some effect. Senator Pearson has called up on Mr. Nixon to withdraw Dr. Butz's nomination, although the Senator intends to vote for him. Senator Pearson, like Senator Jack Miller, Republican of Iowa, is up for re‐election next year. Senator Miller, ranking Republi can on the Agriculture Commit tee, will vote against Dr. Butz. Senator Miller will be joined by another Republican, Senator Milton R. Young of North Dakota, who said he was a farm er first and a Republican second.

231-> A New Bridge in Tennessee Will End A Century of Isolation for a Village
The Talk of Big Springs, Tenn. BIG SPRINGS, Tenn.—The noisiest thing in Big Springs is usually the recess hour at the one‐room schoolhouse. The second noisiest thing is the chickens picking in Par ralee Hurd's front yard. And when it gets real quiet, you can hear the Clinch River flowing by. But Big Springs (population 163) has been unusu ally noisy this month with the big cement mixers chugging down the dirt road and the crane grinding away. Pretty soon there will be the occa sional rumble of a car cross ing the new bridge — and then Big Springs will be join ing the rest of Tennessee after a century of isolation. “I think everybody want ed the bridge,” said Miss Hazel Begley, the warm faced school teacher, who en visions both the school and her professional career com ing to an end. “Now I think people are afraid that Big Springs will lose its charm.” Named after the clear, cool spring that bubbles to the surface across the road from Mrs. Hurd's house, Big Springs has been just about as isolated as any community can get, even in Appalachia. With no stores and no tele phones, Big Springs is 12 miles down the dirt road from the nearest paved highway and the nearest store and gas station, on the way to Clinchport, Va. To get to Sneedville, the seat of Hancock County, Tenn., the farmers of Big Springs still have to drive the corresponding 12 miles back along the other side of the slow, greenish Clinch River, then continue on for 18 more miles. Thus, the new bridge will save them 24 miles, almost an hour of driv ing on the twisting, rutted cow‐trail road. But what else will it mean? “It will mean they can take their burley tobacco to market in Tennessee instead of Virginia,” said Represen tative James H. Quillen, a Re publican from Kingsport, who led the drive for the new bridge. “It means they can do business in their own county seat.” Standing in the doorway of the schoolhouse, Miss Beg ley predicted that the new bridge would help close down one of the last of Tennessee's one‐room schoolhouses. The grade ‐ school children have always remained in Big Springs because nobody wanted them crossing the 50‐yard‐wide river in the small flat ‐ bottomed boats used by adults or on the swinging footbridge down stream. Swinging bridges are com mon all over Appalachia, the only way across creeks for thousands of families. But while Big Springs teen‐agers have crossed the bridge to take a bus to high school in Sneedville, nobody wanted the little ones crossing the swinging bridge in the morn ing haze or the evening dark ness. However, in another month or two, the new bridge will take cars easily to Kynes Ford, 10 miles down the road, where there is a more modern elemen tary school. “They've got a big brick building down there,” said Miss Begley, “with a new cafeteria for hot lunches.” Miss Begley expects her school to remain open until next June, but then she ex pects the 15 to 20 children to he transferred to Kyles Ford the following fall. “I don't know what will happen to me,” she said. “I only got one year of college by grubbin’ and catchin’ where I could. But my mother and daddy were both sick and I helped around the house and that's all the time I could go to school. I don't regret it. We only have one mother and daddy.” The teacher conceded that a bigger school would prob ably benefit her charges, whose ages range from 5 to around 13 or 14, and who have had to rely on an occa sional visit from state educa tion officials for special in struction in art, music and drama. The people of Big Springs have been trying to get their bridge for six years since they talked with Mr. Quillen at one of his “open house” meetings in Sneedville. “I talked to the state, with no results,” he said. “The county didn't have any money — it's the seventh poorest county in the entire United States, Finally, I went to the Appalachian Regional Com mission and they broke the logjam.” The commission, whose characteristic approach to the region's problems has been to build roads and bridges, came up with $35,000 for Big Springs. Then came a “domino effect” of aid — the county road commission supplied some labor and equipment; Operation Mainstream pro vided 17 trained workers; the Tennessee Valley Authority drew up the plans and pro vided a skilled supervisor, John Morris, and the state provided a bulldozer and crane and operators. The ex tra cost has been estimated at $20,000. The farmers of Big Springs themselves will cut the wood en planks that will be used on the steel bridge. When the bridge is com pleted, what else can Big Springs expect? “I don't know,” said James Hurd, squatting in mountain eer fashion by the side of the river, whittling with a sharp knife into a soft branch as he watched cement being poured into the circular steel piling forms. Mr. Hurd occasionally trav els to Morrisontown to work as an upholsterer. Most of the men in Big Springs still work the land for table crops and burley tobacco and raise a few hogs and cattle and chickens. Mr. Hurd didn't think the bridge would change any of that. “Be quicker to get your license plate.” Mr. Hurd vol unteered. “That's about it, I reckon. We'll just wait and see.”

232-> Movie Mailbag
TO THE EDITOR: T seems to me that Rosalyn Drexler's criticism of “Carnal Knowledge” is based on several misconceptions of what the movie was trying to do. Misconception 1: That the movie was saying that this is exactly how all men and women are. The men and women In the movie are extremes; obviously all men and women are not like them, but some are. The extremes point out basic attitudes in all of us. For instance, a prostitute is an extreme, but she does exist, and her existence points up basic attitudes that men have towards women and that women have towards men. These attitudes permeate our society and I'm not sure that there is anyone who is entirely free of them. Therefore, finding out and exhibiting the destructiveness and inhumanity of these attitudes would be beneficial to us all, and extreme examples are the most direct and the most powerful. Misconception 2: That it was a movie glorifying men and their attitudes towards women. Mrs. Drexler says, “Instead of being an‐ object lesson of depersonalization punished, it provides immediate identification for the corrupt.” It seems to me that most men would identify with the men in the picture at least some of the time, but it is difficult far me to understand how anyone could see the movie and miss the fear and pain experienced by the men, as well as the women. Certainly the end of the movie would disabuse anyone of the idea that Jack Nicholson was a hero; I can't believe that any man would want to identify with or emulate a protagonist with a total inability to relate to a woman unless he pays her and writes the script. Misconception 3: That the movie was unfair to women. This was a movie made by men about men's attitudes towards women. The woman's side was shown only as the men saw it. The movie never attempted to really show anything from the woman's point of view—which is not only perfectly legitimate considering the purposes and context of the movie, but, in fact, preferable, since Jules Feiffer and Mike Nichols would only have been guessing, not being, women. The problem here is that it will probably be some time before women get equal time; that is, a movie written, produced, directed, etc., by women showing the woman's point of view. New Castle, Del.

233-> Television
LONDON. UDE THE OBSCURE,” which starts tonight on American television in the BBC's remarkably faithful six‐part dramatization, was the last novel Thomas Hardy wrote. When it appeared, in 1895, it was condemned by critics on both sides of the Atlantic. In London, The Pall Mall Gazette headlined its review “Jude the Obscene” and said the novel was dirt, drivel, and damnation. The lady reviewer of the New York World said the book was a bad blend of Zola and Tolstoi, and that humanity as seen by Hardy was largely compounded of hoggishness and hysteria. There were some good notices, too. Havelock Ellis, who reviewed it for a London magazine, thought it was the greatest novel written in England for many years. But the general opinion was expressed by the Bishop of Wakefield, who threw the book into the fire—probably, said Hardy, in his despair at being unable to burn the author. One of the London reviews was by Edmund Gosse, a close friend of Hardy's, who wrote, “What has Providence done to Mr. Hardy that he should rise up in the arable land of Wessex and shake his fist at his creator?” Hardy was a complex man, and a simple answer to this question will be a wrong one. He was naturally melancholy, and his first marriage, which in 1895 was still dragging on had been a disaster. But that was not all. We shall know Hardy better, and come nearer to an answer to Gosse's question, when we explore a deep and lasting relationship of Hardy's, which remained unknown for almost a hundred years, with a woman he met in 1867 when she was a girl and he was a young man of 27. * Her name was Tryphena Sparks, and she was his cousin. They were engaged for five years, she probably bore him the only child he ever had, they parted bitterly, and he remembered her for the rest of his life. He created many of the women of his poems and novels in her image. The most literal portrait of her is in “Jude the Obscure,” in which incidents in the life of the heroine, Sue Bridehead, correspond closely with those now known in the life of the girl Hardy called his “lost prize.” They parted in 1872. Hardy had not seen her for many years when he wrote in his journal for March 5, 1890, that hi the train on the way to London he had begun a poem about a cousin. It was, he said, a curious example of sympathetic telepathy. Tryphena was dying at the time, though he did not know this. She died six days later, at the age of 38. The poem is entitled “Thoughts of Phena,” and it is in this that he calls her his lost prize. In his autobiography, Hardy remembers many village girls he knew in his youth, and also writes about Mrs. Florence Henniker, whom he loved when he was in his fifties. But about the woman who was, to say the least, his fiancée for five years, he says nothing. Apart from the mention of the lines written in the train, there is not one word written directly about her. He did his best to suppress everything. In his last years he went through his papers destroying photographs, letters and manuscripts. On the last page of his last notebook he reminds himself to continue to destroy old papers . After his death in 1928, his second wife made a bonfire of most of those that remained. Hardy began his affair with Tryphena in 1867. In one of the few personal notebooks that have survived, the date 1867 is written on the left hand side of the first page, but after that 10 sheets have been cut out, leaving only the stumps. So from Hardy's private papers nothing is known of Tryphena. But once her early history is known from other sources, his work is seen to abound with references to her, and she is revealed as probably the single greatest influence on Hardy as a man and a writer. Her engagement to Hardy came to light by sheer accident when her daughter, Mrs. Nellie Bromell, met Lois Deacon, a writer, in 1959 and told her about it. Nellie possessed Tryphena's album with many photographs, and it was Nellie who identified the picture of the son her mother bore Hardy. Until a few days before her death in 1965, at the age of 86, Nellie still talked about her mother, Tryphena. She wrote many letters about her, which are still in Miss Deacon's possession. Now I must declare my own interest in the Tryphena story. I cannot claim to be a disinterested commentator. In 1964, I heard of Miss Deacon's discovery and went to see her with the idea of writing a magazine article. I was at first very skeptical, but after I saw the photographs and talked to Nellie and read her letters to Miss Deacon, I became convinced that the story was in substance true, and too good for just an article. So Miss Deacon and I collaborated in the writing of a book which was published in 1966 with the title “Providence and Mr. Hardy.” The story briefly is this. Hardy was the son of a master mason in Dorset. At the age of 21 he left for London to work as an architect, returning home five years later, in 1867. Tryphena was 16. They became lovers and were engaged to marry. Two years later Tryphena left for London to train as a teacher at Stockwell Normal College. The couple often met in London. By the time she qualified, in 1871, he had written two novels. She became headmistress of a girls' school in Plymouth. For some reason they broke off their engagement in 1872. Hardy married Emma Lavinia, his first wife, and, in 1877, Tryphena married a Devon man and went to live with him in a pub in Topsham. In the next 12 years she had four children and Hardy made his name as a novelist. They did not meet. Then, in 1890, she died of a rupture, and her influence on him suddenly became greater than ever. He visited her grave at Topsham and left a card saying, “In Loving Memory, Tom Hardy.” He visited her former training college at Stockwell, and wrote poems to her memory, in one of which he comes near to deciding to kill himself. * Then he began to write “Jude the Obscure,” which has two themes. The first is that of Jude's struggle for an education. The second and more important theme is that of the adulterous and mismatched union between Jude and his cousin Sue Bridehead. In the preface to the first edition, Hardy says that he had visited the scenes of the novel before writing it: we know he had visited Topsham and Stockwell. And he also says that “some of the circumstances” of the novel were suggested by the death of a woman in 1890. That was the year of Tryphena's death. Sue and Tryphena are astonishingly alike. Both were country girls; both light, slight, and mobile, with dark hair and eyes; both went to Normal schools as Queen's scholars; both had love affairs with cousins. The similarities of the novel to the Hardy‐Tryphena affair are too many for coincidence. And according to the “Oxford Dictionary of Christian Names,” the real name of the apostle who bore Hardy's Christian name, Thomas, was Judas, the modern form of which is Jude. Now for the child. Hardy wanted children, but his wife Emma gave him none. After Emma died, and he married again in 1913 at the age of 73, he provided for a child in his will. But the only child he ever had was probably the boy by Tryphena, born in the early summer of 1868. In Tryphena's album there was a photograph of a boy aged about 8. Nellie Bromell said the child was Hardy's boy, that everyone knew this, and that his name was Randal. He was born when Tryphena was 17 and was looked after by Tryphena's mother, Rebecca. When Tryphena went to teach at Plymouth, Rebecca accompanied her, taking the child as her own. When Tryphena married, the boy, who was then 9, was sent to live in Bristol with his uncle Nathaniel, a violin maker. Nellie knew nothing more about the boy, except that he died as a young man. She did not know how or where. Perhaps this child is enough to explain why Hardy suppressed all mention of Tryphena, but there may be another reason. There is some evidence that he feared, rightly or wrongly, that their relationship was closer than that of cousins, and that she was really his niece. This is only conjecture, for incest is hardly likely to be documented. But here are two of the many fragments of evidence. The typescript of Hardy's autobiography (published as if it were a biography of him by his secand wife Florence, but really his own work) originally contained the Innocent statement that he was the oldest of four children and the only one of the four who married. Hardy then Inserted, In his own hand, that he had “no nephew or niece.” Later still he made another change, to make it clear that he had no “blood niece.” Why was he so anxious to have this understood, when, if neither of his two sisters or brother married, as they did not, there would have been no reason for anyone to think he had nephews or nieces? And secondly, when he was more than 70, Hardy spent an evening with a friend discussing an intimate matter which was causing that friend much anxiety. Hardy sympathized, saying that in his youth he had been in the same position. The friend's trouble was that he was living with a woman who was his niece. But incest is unproved, and unprovable. The whole Tryphena story has been debated by Hardy scholars with a violence that has surprised me. Who would have thought literary scholars had such violence in them? Some authorities on Hardy, like F. B. Pinibn and the late Professor C. J. Weber, have strongly opposed the whole thesis. Others, like Dr. W. R. Rutland and Dr. Frank Southerington, just as strongly support it. And there Is another writer, not a Hardy scholar but a man who understands Hardy better than most academics, whose views I must quote. He is John Fowles, whose novel “The French Lieutenant's Woman” is saturated with the spirit of the time and place of the Hardy‐Tryphena affair. Mr. Fowles sets “The French Lieutenant's Woman” in 1867, the same year that Hardy went back to Dorset and met Tryphena who was then a girl of 16; he also sets his novel in and around the lush countryside of South Dorset which was very much Hardy's milieu. It is important, to me anyway, that so good a novelist as Fowles, and one so sympathetic to the spirit of Hardy, should believe Tryphena to have been a fundamental influence on Hardy as a man and as a writer, and should say of Hardy's relationship with Tryphena, as he does in “The French Lieutenant's Woman,” that “never was an English genius so devoted and indebted to one muse and onomuse only.”

235-> Vacations End for Tenderlings
S anyone knows, has read “Heidi” knows, sheep and goats turned loose in the spring to roam the mountain fields must be rounded up at summer's end and brought back to the farmhouse, there to live right under the same roof with the family. There hasn't been a hoofbeat on our street since the iceman sold his horse thirty years ago, but we have our own version of the fall roundup. Every October, before the the first frost, a dozen or more plants make their annual migration from garden border to indoor haven. We prepare ahead of time by soaking and scrubbing all the clay pots that have accumulated and dry them in the sun. Then we mix up a batch of topsoil, sand, and well‐disintegrated humus from the compost pile. Inside the house, the fluorescent growing lights and the watering trays are put in order. (In the spring, it seemed wise to leave the task until the fall.) Swing‐out planters taken down in June go back up on their brackets in the sunniest kitchen windows. Now to the selection of plants which make the transition from garden to window One red‐leafed coleus will he coming back inside for the third time. We've successfully turned it into a miniature “tree,” content to flourish at a permanent height of 18 inches. It was nowhere as difficult as bonsai: we simply trimmed and shaped it from time to time, making certain to pinch off the many flower stalks before they could bloom. After a while, the plant stopped trying to grow upwards and concentrated instead on keeping a new set of leaves coming every few months to displace the fading ones. This year we'll bring in an assortment of three or four coleus. We've got our eyes on a few fibrous begonias that should do nicely indoors. One is too big to cover with a bushel basket — not surprising, since it is completing its second summer in an ideal location. This one plant, in addition to providing numer ous midwinter bouquets, is the sire of a dozen smaller plants surrounding it in the same bed. This fall, it will get the usual brutal treatment: chopped back until it looks like a marine recruit's haircut. Within two months it will be in full bloom. Last winter, we cut it hack four times —each time the cuttings, placed in opaque vases, rooted and formed new plants. We usually pull geraniums up by the bare roots and hang them in a cool, wellventilated area of the cellar to winter over. Last year, when we jerked them out, we were surprised to find they had self‐seeded. New plants were volunteering in the patio tubs. Under the lights, they grew all winter and bloomed beautifully this summer. If we don't find any upstarts this year, we'll probably make cuttings (where the younger stalks join the main stem) and root them in wet sand. Depending on the amount of space we have, we'll bring in an impatiens or two, and a browalia for the first time. They'll have to be spectacular to outdo the second‐year plants, however. Last winter we stood back in awe as a lantana and a hushtype periwinkle vied for bloom honors. We have found that mot two‐way plants don't fare well if they're ?? during transplanting. But neither should their entire ball of garden soil be shifted to the pot. After the ball has been shaken to where the roots are showing, we transfer it to a pot lined with our pasty‐wet soil mixture. Another dollop of new soil goes on top of the ball. One of the hazards of bringing pet plants back in doors is that they bring their pets alone: hugs, worms, weeds, and occasionally a clandestine pansy or sweet alyssum. Since we don't want to discover any critters hibernating in our house, we have a holding pattern: two days in the garage, riffed at least once with a spray of water, and a week under the lights in the basement. Then it's upstairs, onto the windowsills and into our winter lifestyle.

236-> Mills Offers a Fund‐Sharing Plan Tied to Local Needs
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30— Representative Wilbur D. Mills disclosed and formally intro duced as legislation today his long‐promised substitute for President Nixon's program of revenue sharing. Mr. Mills, the Arkansas Dem ocrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee and thus is the single most influential member of Congress on tax matters, said that he was introducing his plan now so that it could be studied by “those interested in the sub ject.” The fact that he spoke of “interested” individuals, and not merely members of Con gress, led to some speculation that he hoped to persuade the Administration that his ap proach was an acceptable sub stitute for the President's great ly different plan. Presumably consideration of the Mills plan would get under way some time after the turn of the year. Mr. Mills's plan would, like the Administration's, provide direct financial assistance to state and local governments with many fewer restrictions than are now applied to such financial grants. But the dis tribution formula and many other details are different. Among the key differences is that the Mills distribution for mula for cities and counties would be based partly on need—that is, on the number of low‐income families in a locality. Mr. Mills would base aid to the states entirely on how much money each state raised from income taxes, thus pro viding a strong incentive for states to adopt or increase in come taxes. Such taxes tend to bear less heavily on those who are less well off financially than do levies such as the sales tax. The Administration's reve nue‐sharing plan would distrib ute the money involved according to a formula based largely on population, with a bonus going to states that taxed their citizens most heavily. The Administration's plan was the subject of hearings by Mr. Mills's committee but was never given formal considera tion beyond that point, mainly because both Mr. Mills and the committee's ranking Republi can, John W. Byrnes of Wiscon sin, objected to it. Mr. Mills kept promising, through the spring and early summer, that he would soon offer a revenue‐sharing bill of his own, but it was not forth coming until today. At one point, he reportedly told a group of Democratic of ficials that the whole idea was so unsound that he would never permit any type of revenue sharing bill to emerge from his committee. Later, he said that he was working on his own version of revenue sharing, but that it would give Federal fi nancial aid only to cities and counties, bypassing the states. Finally, he said that he was for a controlled and restricted form of revenue sharing for both state and local govern ments. As the promrsed Mills plan failed to materialize, however, there were reports that he had, simply been unable to devise a plan that would do all the things he wanted. Key among these things was to win him self friends among people who would be important to him if he made a serious run for the Democratic Presidential nomination next year, as he is expected to do. Mr. Mills apparently got off the hook when the Administra‐] tion assigned a lower priority to revenue sharing in August, after Mr. Nixon announced his new economic program designed to restore prosperity without in flation. Mr. Mills's committee then had to turn its attention to the tax part of the Adminis tration's economic plan. The plan that Mr. Mills in troduced today would give local governments a total of $3.5 billion a year for five years and state governments $1.8‐billion a year for the same length of time. Thus, the plan is only a tem porary one, subject to Congres sional review after five years, instead of the permanent com mitment to transfer Federal revenues to state and local governments that is involved in the Administration's plan. Per manence of the Nixon plan was one of the key features that Mr. Mills objected to. Distribution of the money among local governments under the Mills plan would depend on population and the proportion of low‐income families. As for the states, the Mills plan provides for “piggyback ing,” that is, having the Fed eral Government administer the collection and enforcement of state income taxes, provided they are substantially similar to the Federal income tax in their main provisions. They would not have to be identical, and their rates would, of course, be significantly lower than the Federal income tax rate. The piggybacking idea has been discussed by tax ex perts for years. The completely new feature of the Mills plan is, however, that it bases the distribution of funds to the states on their in come taxes, after the first two years. For the first two years, a state that had no income tax or a low one would receive from the Federal Government an amount equal at least to 1 per cent of the Federal income taxes collected in that state. This would end after two years and all states would be gov erned by the basic distribution formula. This formula would provide that every state receive an amount equal to 15 per cent of the collections under its own state income tax, up to a ceiling of 6 per cent of the Federal in come tax collections from that state. The recipient governments would be restricted by the Mills plan to a list of high priority items on which they could spend the Federal money. The Administration plan has few such restrictions. Tinder the Mills bill, the money could be spent for public health, safety and transportation pro grams and environmental pro grams, along with a few others.

237-> Chiang's Birthday Is Celebrated Festively on Taiwan
TAIPEI, Taiwan, Oct. 31— Ten thousand students and mili tary cadets formed ranks in front of the Presidential Office Building this morning to sing songs of tribute to Nationalist China's “Great Leader” on his 84th birthday. But President Chiang Kai shek, as is his custom, stayed in seclusion outside Taipei to spend a quiet day. Annually, early in October, the generalissimo issues a mes sage urging Government func tionaries and the public not to celebrate his birthday with great fanfare. The appeal stresses the need for austerity during the continuing period of civil war with the “Communist rebel clique” on the mainland. This year, instructions have been disregarded. Strings of miniature plastic flags have been hung everywhere across narrow lanes and major boule vards and along the sides of buildings. In railway stations, depart ment stores, Government build ings and other public places, areas designated as “longevity halls” have been decorated with pine trees, bunches of uncooked noodles and other symbols of long life. Hundreds of thou sands of people wishing to pay respect to the President enter the halls to sign their names on birthday scrolls and to bow before large red‐and‐gold rend erings of the Chinese character “shou,” meaning long life. There is an abundance of other activities, with the em phasis on pure entertainment. The program includes fireworks displays, concerts of popular songs and athletic competitions with “longevity cups” for the winners. This year the festive air of the birthday celebrations seems especially welcome. Although there has bee no sense of crisis or panic here since the United Nation voted to expel the Nationalist Government, the past week has been tense and saddening for many here. Since last spring, President Chiang has been delegating more of his responsibilities to others, particularly to his elder son, Deputy Premier Chiang Ching‐kuo, but the President is still believed to make all ma jor governmental decisions and his health is considered good. In an editorial of tribute this morning, the English‐language China Post attributed the Presi dent's long life and strong health to his good living hab its, devoutness, and “his abil ity to keep calm at moments of crisis.” Today's newspapers here also contained reports of birthday greetings sent to the general issimo by 133 members of the United States House of Repre sentatives, including the Speak er, Carl Albert; the Democratic majority leader, Hale Boggs, and the Republican minority leader, Gerald R. Ford. The President's birthday has come to be regarded as an auspicious day for new begin nings. Many stores schedule their grand openings for Oct. 31 and Taiwan's third televi sion channel, to be used for educational programs, is begin ning service today.

238-> Whoop‐Up Country: Where the Mounties Tamed the West
FORT MACLEOD, Alberta—Alberta is famous for Banff, Lake Louise, Jasper National Park and for its the rodeo from which Calgary annually re quires a full year to recover before taking off again on another whirl. But the subtler fascinations of the section of Alberta known as Whoop‐Up Country, stretching south from Calgary to the United States border, have somehow been neglected. Even many of the tour ists passing through on their way to the more celebrated places miss it. Americans, in fact, should get to know Whoop ‐Up Country, since they are largely responsible for it. Yankees are identified in Canadian history books as the “unscrupulous trespassers” who, disregarding border protocol, entered Canada to debauch the Blackfoot tribes with “rotgut whisky” and rob the plains of buffalo skins, then prized as robes. For good reason, Fort Hamilton, a fur‐trading post near Lethbridge, 33 miles east of here, came to be known as Fort Whoop‐Up, and it was the de bauchery, brigandage and licentious ness prevailing along the wagon route from Fort Benton, Mont., that prompted the new Canadian Government in 1873 to form the Northwest Mounted Police, later renamed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A year later, a detachment of 150 scarlet‐coated protectors of law and order, under Col. James F. Macleod, marched across the plains to establish here on the banks of Oldman River their first headquarters in the Rocky Mountain region. Their objective was to subjugate Fort Whoop‐Up and send the Yankee whisky traders back over the Whoop‐Up Trail to the United States. Describing the conditions that pre vailed, a pert attendant in the travel office handed me a folder with this paragraph marked: “Beginning in 1869, lumbering bull trains reached northward from Fort Benton, Mont., carving the Whoop‐Up JAY WALZ is The Times correspondent in Ottawa. Trail deep into the prairie sod. Across the 49th Parallel (the United States Canada border), they pushed to supply whisky‐trading posts at Whoop‐Up, Stand‐Off, Kipp and Slide‐Out. Creaking and groaning, the wagons returned to Fort Benton laden with their valuable cargoes of buffalo robes, skins and furs.” In Whoop‐Up Country, not long ago on an assignment, I explored the area bit by bit. But, the tour can be made in a more orderly way by anyone with a car in three or four days. I must confess, first, that Whoop‐Up Country no longer lives up to its name. As a Mountie of the Fort Macleod Con stabulary informed me, “Law and order prevails everywhere.” On the afternoon my Greyhound bus dropped me at the terminal just off Main Street, it was not only orderly but very quiet. It was not possible, even in the interests of re search, to buy a drink of whisky anywhere but at the provincial package liquor store. “I'm afraid you'll find no bars or cocktail lounges anywhere in town,” the constable informed me. “But you can have a beer at the hotel.” The Queens Hotel on Main Street has a beer parlor. But no hotel or motel in town serves hard liquor even with meals. I was informed, however, that the Westerner Motel, which has a good restaurant, hoped soon to have a liquor license to serve drinks in the dining room. Fort Macleod, Lethbridge and Water ton Lakes Park, the high points of a Whoop‐Up tour, all have their attrac tions. But fresh from a long winter in uptight Ottawa, I enjoyed, above all, the openness of this Western land and its people. In a Lethbridge restaurant, a couple from Edmonton asked to join me even though all tables had not been occu pied. Diners in neighboring booths often engaged one in talk, and on one occasion, a rancher sitting next to me in a coffee bar aired his gripes about “that awful Government in Ottawa.” Such congeniality is rarely expe rienced in eastern Canada, and I won dered if it might have come down to these latter‐day Whoop‐Uppers from their free and easy, whisky‐trading forebears. One of them insisted, how ever, that the prevailing informality was related instead to the wide‐open spaces in which uncrowded people breathed and moved around. The land sloping toward the moun tains rises to about 5,000 feet above sea level, and the air seems cooler, brisker and certainly fresher than it does in any eastern city. But the weath er is erratic. In winter chinooks often blow warm, dry winds off the mountains to melt the snows and clear the highways of drifts. I awoke one spring morning to see a snowstorm of blizzard propor tions raging outside my hotel window. The weatherman said a wet wind from the plains cooled as it was pushed over the mountains, and the humidity in the air turned to snow. I had intended to hire a car for the 75‐mile drive from Lethbridge where my assignment had taken me to Water ton Lakes National Park, which I was told “rivals Banff but most people don't know about it.” (The park is actually the Canadian section of border‐strad dling Waterton‐Glacier International Peace Park formed in 1932.) Instead, I rode down as the guest of John Mul grew, editor and publisher of The Ad viser, a bimonthly newspaper circulat ing among Whoop‐Up Country farmers and cattlemen. At Wellington, the road veered to the southwest and ran through Magrath and Cardston. We were immediately in foothill country that, Mulgrew said, was mostly an Indian reservation. “You'll find Bloods, Pegrains, Sar cees,” he said. “They are no longer ‘de bauched’ with bad whisky. There are many good people back there. They farm some, tend cattle and work sea sonally in the sugar‐beet fields. The women do beadwork that makes its way into gift shops.” Mulgrew paused, then added, “But they don't get rich.” Approaching the cattle town of Cardston, just 20 miles north of the Montana border, he pointed out a “sub urb” of poor huts and shanties occupied by Indians who had sought social haven in town. They clung there on the fringes of modern society. Mulgrew drove off the main highway to show me Cardston's chief landmark, the impressive stone Mormon shrine on the town heights. “It's so sacred to Mormons that only the highest church officials can go inside,” he informed me. “I don't know what's in there— neither do any of the Mormons I know. They have to go to church in that little building across the street.” At the entrance to Waterton Park, we paid the $2 Canadian National Park admission fee, and were immediately driving through mountain landscape that certainly did rival Banff in beauty. The largest lake, Upper Waterton, is seven and one‐half miles long and in some places is 450 feet deep. But, like Lake Louise, its apparent size is re duced by the snowcapped peaks reflect ed on its surface. Through the ages, glaciers off the Lewis and Clark ranges have deepened and widened the valley filled only partly by the lake. The deep ening created Cameron Falls, the only cockeyed cascade I have ever seen. The water falls slant‐wise. Compared with Banff and Jasper Na tional Park, the Waterton Lakes region is undeveloped, and this is part of its charm. There is only one road in and out of the park, and the best way to get from Waterton Lakes, Canada, to the American section of the park at Goathaunt Landing across the border in Glacier National Park is aboard the lake motorboat making regular trips during summer. On my recent preseason visit, there were, as Mulgrew anticipated, “more animals than people.” A score of mule deer wandered around, and pair after pair sauntered up to me posing for snapshots in exchange for pieces of candy bar. Mulgrew said that until mid‐June, one often found Waterton Lakes rather emp ty. After that the dozen motels, hotels and camping sites began to fill up until about Labor Day. The leading hostelry is the Swiss‐chalet type Prince of Wales Hotel, where a room for the night can run to $15 single and $25.70 double. There are other lodgings to suit almost any budget. The park offers opportunities for hik ing over miles of trails. Other activities include motorboating and canoeing on international waters, bird and animal watching, mountain climbing, golfing, tennis and—loafing. Driving out of Waterton Lakes, Mul grew headed north on Highway 6 again, skirting the mountains for most of the 30 miles to Pincher Creek. A white mountain goat, like those one usually sees far off through a telescope, crossed the road ahead of us, and my driver pulled up short. Instead of scampering away, the majestic beast deliberately approached the car. Driving on, Mulgrew told me to be on the lookout for hear, cougar and elk. He was most anxious to show me buffalo on the Government range—the kind the whisky traders used to kill illegally. When it appeared that there were none grazing near the highway, he turned up a dirt road and drove into the mountains for about three miles. Suddenly we sighted a herd of bison —perhaps 100 or more—in the fold of a foothill. We parked and watched them grazing in the shadow of the set ting sun, and then turned back toward Fort Macleod and Lethbridge. The Alberta Government has built a replica of the original Fort Mac leod to house a museum (admission, 50 cents) telling how Whoop‐Up Country was tamed. Among the exhibits are life‐size wax figures of Colonel Mac lend, who led the Mounties' march, and Chief Crowfoot of the Blackfoot Con federacy, at their historic meeting 96 years ago. Canadian history teaches that the Northwest Mounted Police as protectors of law and order never tortured, killed or massacred Indians to win the West. Neither did they resort to “firewater” to soften up or dupe hostile braves. In the words of John Peter Turner, his torian of the Mounties, the force came out here to introduce Indians and freebooters alike to civilized procedure and authority.” And here in effigy was Colonel Mac leod, in full British Army regalia, re ceiving Chief Crowfoot, just as he did nearly a century ago. When the Blackfoot chief entered Macleod's quarters, wrote Turner, “sup pressed excitement pervaded the fort as with grave and courteous formal ity Assistant Commissioner Macleod strode forward to meet his red‐skinned visitor. … On that day, Dec. 1, 1874, Canada's ship of state was safely launched upon the broad prairie ocean of the West.” Thus, as we learn at Fort Macleod's museum, did Canada win her West. There was no Custer's Last Stand here. Even Sitting Bull, after the massacre of Custer's force, found sanctuary here with some 5,600 braves, wives and chil dren. When he moved north into Whoop‐Up Country, Sitting Bull learned “that the scarlet tunic of the Mounted Police stood for the same kind of law and discipline for the whites as for the Indians,” Turner noted. Today, in more sophisticated parts of Canada, the Mounties' reputation is slip ping; they don't really always get their man, and hippie demonstrators have been heard to yell “pigs” at them. Also, city slickers in the East no longer ac cept the image of Canada as a land of red‐jacketed Nelson Eddys singing “The Indian Love Call.” But here, in their “original home,” the Mounties are still heroes. Fort Mac leod has no police force of its own and contracts with the Mounties to “Maintiens le Droit” (”Maintain the Right“). The Mounties also comprise the Provincial highway patrol, having long since traded in their horses for motor vehicles. Fort Macleod will do even more to honor its pioneer defenders, according to Larry King, the town manager. Get ting ready for a centennial celebration in 1974, merchants on Main Street are already “old‐styling” their store fronts to look as they did in pioneer days. Board sidewalks will be laid, and over them a continuous portico will con tribute to the old‐time atmosphere and protect visitors from the rain, snow and sun. Lethbridge, the largest (population 40,000) and busiest municipality in these parts, has rebuilt old Fort Whoop‐Up. It's located on the site of the great Indian battle where the Black foot defeated the Cree in 1870, a few years before the Mounties came. I was told the new “fort” shows how the old whisky‐fur trading post looked and operated but the furs are for display purposes only, and there isn't a drop of whisky in sight. Otherwise, Lethbridge, 33 miles east of Fort Macleod, is a modern city. Its business is cattle, beef production, wheat and sugar beets. The handsome new University of Lethbridge is rising astraddle a ravine across the Oldman River. The town's most popular attraction today is the municipal Japanese garden, complete with ceremonial teahouse (but no tea) and a traditional dry‐sea scape, made of sand and rock, Nikka Yuko (a Japanese term meaning Jap anese‐Canadian Friendship) was designed and built with the help of Jap anese‐Canadians whose families were detained here as a security measure during World War Ⅱ. Uprooted from their homes in British Columbia and other Canadian prov inces, the Japanese were moved into makeshift houses and made to work in the sugar‐beet fields. Today, they and their children number about 2,500 and are businessmen, doctors, teachers, lawyers and farmers. Such is Whoop‐Up Country. The tour I would recommend for Americans driving up from Montana would take them from Shelby, say, to Glacier Na tional Park, then north over State Rout 17 in Montana and Highway 6 in Al berta to Waterton Lakes Park. One could then follow Highway 6, as I did, to Pincher Creek, swing northeast to Fort Macleod and east to Lethbridge. From there it's a two‐hour drive back to the border, although I suspect many visitors will head north and then, tan talized by the mountains on the western skyline, decide after all to see how things are going in Banff, Lake Louise and Jasper.

239-> National Youth Caucus Formed To Play Role in ‘72 Conventions
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 — Representatives of a committee of 100 student presidents an nounced today the formation of a National Youth Caucus, designed to be a political force in the 1972 Presidential nomi nating conventions. A committee spoksman, Duane Draper, who is president of the National Association of Student Governments, said at a news conference that the caucus would work for the nomination of candidates ac ceptable to the interests of youth. The caucus, which described itself as nonpartisan, opposes the renomination of President Nixon and the nomination of Senator Henry M. Jackson, Democrat of Washington, for President. Mr. Draper said the princi pal concern of the caucus was “immediate and complete with drawal from the war in South east Asia, subject only to the return of prisoners of war.” The caucus, which will hold its first meeting at Loyola Uni versity in Chicago next week end, will work toward the election of young people, espe cially those 18 to 25 years old, as delegates to the national conventions. The Chicago meeting, called the Emergency Conference for New Voters, has been organ ized to stress instruction in political procedures such as party mechanics, delegate se lection and fund‐raising tech niques. Mr. Draper said that one of the main goals of the organiza tion was to bring together a coalition of the young, the poor, minorities and women to select a President who will “speak to their hopes rather than to their fears.” Mr. Draper reported that the caucus intended to begin or ganizing with college students. The students will be expected to persuade other youths, in cluding workers and the unem ployed, to join the effort. Women and minority groups will be recruited through their own political organizations.

240-> Bridge: Aces Overwhelm Mathe Team To Represent U.S. in Olympiad
NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 24— The world champion Aces scored an overwhelming vic tory in the international team final playoff match which ended in the Sheraton Charles Hotel here this after noon, and so qualified to rep resent the United States in the 1972 world team Olym paid in Miami Beach. The players are Bob Goldman, Bob Harnman, Jim Jacoby, Mike Lawrence and Bob Wolf. Their nonplaying cap tain will be Lee Hazen of New York. Hazen announced that the sixth player on the Aces world championship team would be Paul Soloway of Los Angeles. The Aces, playing with great steadiness and occa sional brilliance, defeated a strong foursome, Lew Mathe and Don Krauss of Los An geles, Edgar Kaplan of New York and Norman Kay of Philadelphia, by the massive margin of 171 international match points. The champions took the lead at the start and in creased it steadily, thus con firming the form shown in the 1971 world champion ship, where their opponents were members of a team that finished last. The Aces began the final session this afternoon with a decisive lead of 109 points and added 24 points in the first 16 deals. For the losers Kaplan and Kay were rather less accu rate than they had been in the semifinal match in New York a month ago and Mathe and Krauss were distinctly erratic. The Aces gained ground last night when an optimistic slam attempt failed, and both declarers were deprived of a chance to rise to the oc casion. Both South players had bidding problems when the opponents climbed to five clubs on the first round of the action. In the open room, as shown, Jacoby opened the West hand with two clubs, showing a normal opening bid with a long club Suit. Over a take‐out double by Mathe, North, Wolff raised to game. Krauss judged that his side must have a good fit in the major suits and gambled on slam, perhaps in fluenced by the fact that his team was far behind in the match. South might have tried six spades directly, but he cue bid in clubs and followed with an SOS redouble in the hope that his partner would pick a major. North did not oblige, and South finally had to bid six spades, which West had the best of reasons for doubling. It was important to double, not so much for the sake of an extra 100 points or so, but to dis courage East from sacrificing in seven clubs. West's opening lead of the heart two solved South's problem in that suit. He ran the lead around to his queen, cashed the diamond ace and led a trump. He was under no illusion about the spade situation, and duly went one down. In the replay, the opening bid was one club and again East raised to five clubs over a take‐out double from North. But Hamman as South was content to bid five spades at this point, stopping at a makable level. West began with the spade king, which was safe enough, but shifted to the heart two, again helping the declarer, who proceeded to make 11 tricks without difficulty. The Aces gained 13 international match points on the deal. The best defense would have been for West to cash both his trump winners and exit in one of the minor suits. To make the contract, South would then have had to lead the heart queen from his hand, and if this was covered run the eight later for a sec ond finesse. Before committing himself in hearts South would be able to discover the diamond dis tribution, which would make it plausible that East held a singleton heart together with a mass of minor‐suit cards. As East is sure to have seven diamonds and at least four clubs, he could not have the three‐card heart holding that would allow the normal heart finesse of the Jack to succeed.

241-> Canadian Seeks to Join Suit on Alaska Pipeline
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15—A member of the Canadian Parliament and the Canadian Wildlife Federation petitioned the United States District Court here to be allowed to intervene in suit aimed at halting construction of the trans‐Alaska oil pipeline. David. Anderson, chairman of the special Committee on Environmental Pollution of the Canadian House of Commons, said that he believed this was “the first time that a citizen of a foreign country has come Into a United States court complaining of actions contemplated by United States officials and the threatened environmental effects of those actions on his country.” He said at a news conference that he was acting in a private capacity and not on behalf of the Canadian Government to assure adequate protection of the Canadian coast from oil spills by tankers. The proposed pipeline would carry oil 800 miles from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay to Caldez on the Gulf of Alaska and thence by tanker to the American West Coast. Mr. Anderson said that he had informed Canadian officials, including Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, of his action and had not been discouraged from going ahead. The suit to stop the pipeline was filed by the Environmental Defense Fund, the National Wildlife Federation and Friends of the Earth. They won a preliminary injunction from Judge George L. Hart Jr. last year forbidding the Department of the Interior to issue right‐ofway permit for the pipeline pending a final determination on a permanent injunction.

242-> HARLOW REED, 52, OLIN EXECUTIVE
WESTON, Conn., May 1 — Harlow John Reed, executive vice president and chief oper ating officer of the Olin Corpo ration, died yesterday of a heart attack. He was 52 years old and lived at 18 Buttonball Lane Mr. Reed received a B.S. de gree in electrochemical engi neering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1939. He began as a metallurgical engineer with Phelps Dodge Re fining Corporation. From 1940 to 1943, he was smelter super intendent with the Chile Ex ploration Company, an Ana conda subsidiary. He served as an antiaircraft artillery officer in the Pacific Theater in World War II, after which he worked for 13 years with Singmaster & Breyer, New York engineering firm. As a partner there, he was asso ciated with several major Olin projects, including the alumi num plants of Ormet Corpora tion, aluminum affiliate jointly owned with Revere Copper and Brass, Inc. Mr. Reed joined Olin in 1960 as vice president for engineer ing. In 1965, he became exec utive vice president responsible for the nonferrous metals oper ations and the Winchester Western Division, as well as Olin's interest in Ormet and FRIA Compagnie Internationale pour la Production de l'Alumiue in Guinea. Mr. Reed was elected a di rector of Olin in 1967 and was named chief operating officer in 1968.

243-> Progress in Rome …
At the end of the first day's session of the Group Ten finance ministers in Rome, the United States and its major trading partners appear well on the way toward a resolution of the monetary crisis that has threatened the economic stability of the Western world and Japan. While details of any agreement are still lacking—and may not be forthcoming even after the Rome meetings wind up—Secretary of the Treasury Connally's statement yesterday that “we discussed figures” on parity changes and “the distribution problem inherent in any currency realignment” indicates that realistic bargaining has last been joined. The immediate objective for the United States must be to obtain a realignment of currencies that promises to restore equilibrium to its balance of payments—with out forcing terms upon other nations that would be harmful to their employment, trade and payments posi tions. The basic blunder of beggar‐thy‐neighbor policies for any nation—as the experience of the 1930's demon strated—is that they are equally harmful to the nation that undertakes them. The United States will emerge true winner from the present negotiations if, in strength ening its own international position, it also strengthens the economies of other nations. • • • This negotiation is an exercise in politics as well economics. The Europeans have made clear that they cannot come close to the upward revaluations sought by the United States unless this country is prepared devalue the dollar at the same time. In economic terms, this will cost the United States nothing; devaluations and revaluations are mirror images. Nor would a modest devaluation of the dollar by 5 to 7 per cent restore gold to its throne—both because the free market price of gold is already above that level and because the United States need not and should not resume gold convertibility. However, the formal act of a dollar devaluation will ease the adjustment problem for other nations and prove American willingness to cooperate in building the kind of new monetary system of more flexible exchange rates that it recommends to others. • • • An appropriate realignment of exchange rates would be impossible without United States willingness remove the 10 per cent import surcharge and the “buy American” clause of the investment tax credit. As the Committee for Economic Development has stressed, the import surcharge complicates the exchange‐rate problem, adds to inflationary pressures in the United States, and creates the hazard of “spiraling retaliation which could destroy the whole fabric of international economic relations.” The currency realignments and lifting of the import surcharge which, we hope, will in time result from the Rome meeting should be seized by the United States and the other major financial powers as the opportunity for a new international effort to get rid of the welter of quota and other nontariff barriers that have grown up in recent years as a consequence of international monetary disorder. There could be no better news than a new initiative for economic integration — not only for the Western alliance but for the domestic economies of all the nations involved.

244-> Public Is Found to Resist Prison Reform Proposals
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23—Re form experts have been saying for more than 40 years that prisons and inmates would be better off in urban areas, but most voters, taxpayers and public officials have steadfastly felt otherwise. New York established a prison in Attica in 1921. Rural and semirural sites have re mained common, and a number of states, including Missour?? and Ohio, are planning or build ing in remote locations even today. “Our popularity as a neigh bor ranks somewhere between airports and sewage treatment plants,” one of the nation's leading prison architects ob served recently. Hundreds of promising re form measures, advanced over the last several decades, have encountered substantial public and private indifference and resistance. They frequently sur vive as tokenism or vanish altogether. Some require more money. Almost all would relax, or seem to relax, prison isolation, and security, and both authorities and citizens appear disinclined to take such a risk, however The debilitating process was common long before the revolt a month ago in the prison at Attica, and the national outcry over that event has not been impressive enough to generate real confidence in the prospect of material change. This Unpromising assessment is shaped by many recent de velopments in the prisons. While the public is thought to be only dimly aware of most details, the reformers are not. There is, for example, the basic matter of prison location. A number of experts and other observers greeted with wry amusement the public's sudden discovery of and sharp reaction to the all‐white guard force at Attica. About 85 per cent of the inmates there are said to be nonwhite. When that institution was built, the nation's penologists were already virtually unani mous in their conclusion that such facilities should be con structed in or near large cities. They argued that this would not only make it easier for an inmate's family and friends to visit him but would also make it easier for the state to attract a more diverse and professional staff. The prison went to Attica, a small town. Now, after four decades, a number of states are planning, building or opening, new prisons In places with similar liabilities. Missouri plans an Important facility at St??eIe, an obscure village close to the Arkansas border. New Jersey's new in stitution at Leesburg, highly acclaimed for its design, is deep in the southside farming coun try. Ohio is finishing a huge prison at Lucasville, a town near the Kentucky border that is, according to one critic, “just about as far away from any thing else as they could have gotten it.” Joseph G. Cannon, who un til recently was the Commis sioner of Corrections in Mary land, said in a telephone interview last week that the state's correctional training center, opened in 1966, was situated in Hagerstown. “You just couldn't get any body, as far as professional staff is concerned, to go up there,” he said. “You end up with people—God bless 'em, they're good, hard‐working people—but, for one thing, they don't understand the blacks.” Economic factors are usually cited in explaining the estab lishment of new prisons in rural areas. While the big cities are indifferent or hostile, the small towns often tolerate their pres ence because of the jobs they offer. This problem generates fur ther difficulties. For example, the remote site of prisons has helped to cripple work‐release, one of the “most highly touted reform programs in the coun try. In 1913, misdemeanants in Wisconsin began to take out side jobs, returning to local jails each evening. But it was more than 40 years before the first state, North Carolina, be gan to offer the privilege to adult felons on a large scale. The idea suddenly caught on, and legislature after legislature passed enabling laws in the nineteen‐sixties. At least 37 states are said to have work release laws now. But the pro grams are hardly booming. Walter H. Busher, the direc tor of a national work‐release study project at the Criminal Justice Institute in Sacramento, Calif., estimates that only 5,000 inmates—out of more than 200,000—are participating. Furthermore, he said in a telephone interview that it ap peared that roughly half of those involved were in the work‐release programs of only four states — North Carolina, Florida, Maryland and Califor nia. He also said that the infor mation collected suggested that a substantial number of states with authority to grant work release had fewer than three dozen men enrolled. One of the problems is lodging. North Carolina, like many Southern states, is dotted with small “work camps.” These fa cilities, built to house the no torious chain gangs and long, in disrepute, are again the height of fashion. The men in them have a better chance of finding work in their own communities, transportation may be easy to obtain and it is often not neces sary for a man to leave the job when he finishes his term and goes home. North Carolina, with facil ities in most if not all the larger cities and subsidiary units in the surrounding towns, has another important advan tage over states that group large numbers of men in few remote locations. “The people have always been accustomed to seeing prisoners working out of prison,” said V. L. Bounds, the commissioner. “Our success was largely attributable to getting public support.” The North Carolina law has been liberalized “one way or another” at every session of the legislature since the pro gram started, Mr. Bounds said. He said that only those serving life sentences were excluded. Elsewhere, the laws are more restrictive. Mr. Busher reported laws in various states ‐that bar from the program inmates convicted of crimes involving violence, sex, drugs or alcohol. Reformers contend that some risk in the program is worth while. “These people are going to get out anyway,” one official said. “The only question is whether we parole them the door with $40 and a new suit of clothes and no re sources, no references, nothing to go on.” Various fears have also se verely limited the spread of another widely promoted re form, the halfway house. This is a small unit, often an old mansion in a big city, where prisoners and parolees remain under some supervision. This type of facility is seen as a partial solution to the problems posed by larger, more remote institutions. Many en thusiasts believe that as part of a trend toward “community based corrections,” it may re place the old prisons almost entirely. If so, the plan has a long way to go. Several authorities estimate that there are now only 300 halfway houses serv ing 4,500 of the nation's adult offenders. Units are under tack in Los Angeles, San An tonio, Tex., Detroit, and other cities. “It's mainly just a fear of the unknown,” according to Mike McCartt, a halfway house or ganizer in Cincinnati. “People envision five or 10 convicts hanging around on the street corner taking dope and raping women.” Mr. McCartt recalled a mass meeting held several years ago to win support for a house in a city‐owned building in the predominantly black Avondale area of Cincinnati. He was con fident of success. “Everything was fine until woman got up and started cry ing and saying she'd worked 20 years to pay off her house,” he said. “She felt [the halfway house] would ruin the property values.” Others joined the opposition at this point, and the effort was abandoned. The unit was later opened in a commercial section of the city, but Mr. McCartt said, “We would have preferred grass like everyone else.” A national survey by Louis Harris and Associates, con ducted in 1967 fdr the Joint Commission on Correctional Manpower and Training, found that 80 per cent of those ques tioned approved the idea of halfway houses. But the survey also showed that about half the people in terviewed would oppose a half way house in their neighbor hoods, and more than two out of three thought, most of their neighbors would be against establishing one. At the same time, repeated studies have reported that half way houses cost much less than fullscale Imprisonment, and that the men who emerge from them are substantially more likely to stay out of further trouble. Reform programs inside the prisons are also stalled. For ex ample, vocational and educa tional training programs, long considered a correctional status symbol, frequently conflict with much narrower state interests. Major institutions in various states produce items such as license plates, and also station ery and other printed materials for officials, centerline paint for highway departments and bread for public facilities such as hospitals. Few of the skills required are in wide, demand in the private sector, and in any event the equipment and training in volved are fairly primitive. But those in charge often are under pressure for increased produc tion. The director of “state use” industries in an Eastern prison, who asked not to be identified, complained bitterly that his better “workers” were called away from their machines to “one goddam class or another.” The public's fears also reach behind the bars. Many of the prisons use more than three fourths of their manpower, for security and do without badly needed death, counselors, teachers and other profes sionals. A number of prison authori ties were asked why they did not reduce the guard force, even at the risk of a few escapes, and hire the needed specialists. All were convinced that the public would not toler ate an additional escape a month. The indifferent success of reform efforts casts a broad shadow. Simple custodial duty is not a very exciting business, and that is An added liability in a field that is often said to lack a natural constituency to stir it. Prisons have the lowest pri orities in virtually every state, most corrections officials be lieve. The lack of radical experi mentation and sound statistics has been observed by many state and Federal commissions. It is not even know, for ex ample, how many men and women were in the prisons last month or last year. Representative Claude Pepper, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the Select Commit tee on Crimes, asked for basic information about Attica in pre paration for an inspection. He was sent figures based on 1968 statistics. The American Correctional Association hopes to organize an accrediting commission to measure the nation's prisons on the basis of criteria contained in its Manual of Correctional Standards, last published in 1966. A spokesman for the associa tion said that based on field testing and other observations, not a single penal institution in the country could meet even the standards considered essen tial five years ago. “American prisons today are far, far below the standards set in the 1966 manual,” the spoke man said, “and there really aren't too many differences in the way the prisons shape up. They're all at pretty much the same level.”

245-> HOSPITAL HEADS WEIGH CUTBACKS
Directors of the city's mun icipal hospitals, under orders to cut spending by 5 per cent, said yesterday that they hoped to accomplish this by reducing, rather than eliminating, serv ices to patients. Dr. Joseph T. English, chief of the 18‐hospital system, had asked each hospital administra tor to give him by last night his own institution's plans for achieving the 5 per cent cut back. Dr. English said the cut backs, coming on top of person nel reductions, were needed to stay within a budget of $689 million. Nearly all of the directors said yesterday that they would miss the deadline. Several, though, talked about the gen eral areas in which they hoped to make cutbacks with mini mum impact on patients. At the Bronx Municipal Hos pital Center, for instance, Shel don S. King, executive direc tor, said he planned to reduce the rate of purchasing and to defer some purchasing until the fiscal year beginning next July 1. “Of course, we cannot com promise on drugs and patients’ supplies,” Mr. King added. He noted, too, that the de mand for abortions had de clined at his hospital since the initial rush when the state legal ized the operation July 1, 1970. He said he might cut back abortions to four days a week. In out‐patient departments, Mr. King said, “There may be longer waiting periods.” In other areas, he said, “We may have our offices cleaned every other day instead of every day, and if we have to shut down one or two elevators [all are manually operated in his hospital], we can live with that.” Like many other hospital ad ministrators, Mr. King was not sure how much of the 5 per cent cutback could be achieved with a job attrition program that is already in effect. Bernard Weinstein, executive director of Bellevue Hospital, said that because of a relative ly high turnover rate in Belle vue's nonprofessional staff, he expected attrition to accom plish most of the prescribed cutback there. Under the attrition program, nonprofessional workers who resign or retire are not being replaced in any of the munici pal hospitals. Physicians and nurses are exempt from the program, however, and the Hospitals Corporation's central office is making exceptions for certain nonprofessional jobs that are vital to hospital op erations. Although almost none of the 18 hospital directors have com pleted their plans, Paul Kerz, the top fiscal officer of the Hospitals Corporation, has scheduled conferences with them—one every 90 minutes— for today and tomorrow. Joining in these talks will be spokesmen for the affiliated private hospitals and medical schools that provide the med ical staffs of the municipal hospitals. Although most will arrive at Mr. Kerz's office with very ten tative plans, he said yesterday: “I'm fairly sure I'll know by Friday what the problems are.”

247-> Stennis Warns of a Crisis if Draft Bill Isn't Passed
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 — Senator John. C. Stennis, chair man of the Armed Services Committee, said today that the military services faced a “man power crisis” because of expira tion of the draft. He urged the Senate to pass legislation that would allow conscription to be resumed. Senator Stennis's remarks, at a news conference following a meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the civilian heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force, appeared to be part of an intensive publicity and lob bying campaign by the Penta gon and its supporters in the Senate aimed at rescuing the Selective Service bill. Earlier today, Defense Sec retary Melvin R. Laird, an nounced through his press spokesman that he was putting aside other business to concen trate on persuading the Senate to pass the draft bill. Many Senators of both par ties said this evening that they had been called by military of ficials who urged them to vote to reinstate the draft. The Government's authority to draft men into the Army ex pired June 30, and no one has been drafted since then. Although both houses have approved legislation continuing conscription through the mid dle of 1973, the conference agreement on the bill has be come tied up in the Senate over the parts of the bill relating to troop withdrawals and military pay. The next action in the Senate is likely to be a vote, probably Thursday, on a motion to table the conference agreement. If it passed, the bill would be returned to the conference to see if the conferees could produce a bill acceptable to the Senate. Senator Stennis said that if the tabling motion succeeded, he was not sure the conference could ever reach another agree ment. “There's certainly no such thing as a quick conference on this bill,” the Mississippi Demo crat said. A bipartisan coalition has formed behind the tabling mo tion, which will probably be offered either by Gordon Allott of Colorado, the third‐ranking Senate Republican, or Mike Mansfield of Montana, the Democratic leader. There are the following three distinct parts of the coalition: ¶A block of about 20 Senators who are opposed to the draft in any form. ¶ Strong supporters of Sen ator Mansfield's amendment— originally included in the bill by the Senate but diluted in conference—that would set a national policy that all Ameri can troops should be with drawn from Vietnam by the end of this year if prisoners of war are released first. ¶Senators, led by Mr. Allott, who want to concentrate the pay increases in the bill on low ranking enlisted men and junior officers. Members of the coalition were confident today that they would succeed in sending the bill back to the conference. Senator Stennis said that the vote “will be close.” Despite their predictions of serious consequences if the draft is not continued, neither Senator Stennis nor Secretary Laird appeared willing as yet to pay the price of supporting the Mansfield amendment or Senator Allott's pay proposal in order to get the bill through the Senate. Senator Stennis said that in July and August, without the draft, the military services had “suffered in both the quantity and quality of men they were getting.” Later, staff members said that there was not a serious shortage of enlistments but that the men who entered the services in these months were not as well educated or as qualified for technical special ties as would be expected with the draft. Actually, Army enlistments were higher than in the same months of last year. According to Pentagon manpower experts, there were 14,800 enlistments in July and 14,900 in August, compared with 12,500 and 12, 900 in the same months last year. However, the service chiefs told Senator Stennis and Sena tor Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Com mittee, that highly qualified men were not volunteering without the threat of the draft. They said that 36 per cent of those entering the Army in July and August were in the lowest of four intelligence and aptitude categories. They also said that 37 per cent were not high school graduates. The Joint Chiefs said that both these percentages were consid erably higher than the compar able figures last year. Senator Stennis said that if the services could not attract qualified men, either, through the draft or the threat of the draft, there would be serious shortages next year, in techni cal specialists.

248-> Antibusing Pickets Close 2 Car Plants
PONTIAC, Mich., Sept. 14— Antibusing pickets caused the closing of two major General Motors Corporation's plants here today. Hundreds of pickets, largely women and children, marched in front of G.M.'s Fisher body plant beginning at 5 A.M., and more than half the workers re fused to cross the line. As a result, the company closed the plant, which normal ly has 2,000 employes on the first shift. The closing of the body plant led several hours later to the closing of the allied Pontiac car assembly plant, when it ran out of car bodies. The Pontiac plant had 1,500 workers on the first shift. The pickets were also on hand for the afternoon shift, causing similar layoffs, with about the same number of workers made idle. The workers, all members of the United Auto Workers, stayed away from their jobs de spite orders of the union lead ers from Leonard Woodcock, the union president, down to local officials, that they should ignore the line and go to work. “We've shown what the people of Pontiac think about busing,” said Irene McCabe, who heads the antibusing National Action Group. G. M. officials could not un derstand why their plants were being picketed. The company is the largest employer and tax‐ payer in Pontiac and many of the parents protesting the bus ing work in these plants. By successfully closing the plants, Mrs. McCabe hoped to demonstrate that her antibus ing group had the support of the white workers and they were willing to support her or ganization, even against the wishes of the union or General Motors. There was no violence at the plant gates—just booing and catcalling at workers, both black and white, who entered the plant, and some booing at the yellow school buses moving up and down Baldwin Avenue in front of the Fisher body plant, carrying children to schools. The police made no effort to keep the pickets from march ing in front of the parking lots and plant entrances. Workers who wanted to work had to edge their way through the crowd. “If we were doing that,” said one black watching the pickets, “everyone would be in jail.” The busing of 9,000 students for integration in the 23,000‐ pupil system was ordered by Federal Judge Damon Keith. Today, Judge Keith turned down a request for Federal marshals to enforce his decree. The request was made by the city, the school bard and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peo ple. Members of the Ku Klux Klan are charged with dynamit ing and burning 10 buses be fore the school year started, and for a few days last week there were demonstrations by whites at the school bus depot and at a few schools. This has faded and the buses generally have rolled without interfer ence in the city. There has been little actual support for the busing order in Pontiac. At best, the city and school and civic leaders say the order should not be opposed because it is the law, and the school system is at tempting to appeal Judge Keith's order to the United States Supreme Court. Even the union leaders did not defend the integration ef fort in telling workers to go to work. They said only that stay ing out would violate the union contract and thereby cost the workers a day's pay. “Regardless of how much merit this issue has, this is not a U.A.W. picket line,” said Don ald Johnson, the president of Local 596, this morning. A similar reaction came from Mr. Woodcock yesterday after Local 596 voted to donate $100 to the antibusing group. Mr. Woodcock did not say that supporting an antischool integration group was wrong. But he said that it was “un thinkable” that a local union would contribute to a group that intended to cause a work stoppage “in violation of the U.A.W. contract with General Motors.” Mrs. McCabe, while leading the demonstrations, promised more at City Hall in the future. The effort to close down the G.M. body plant here is not be ing repeated tomorrow.

249-> ‘M*A*S*H’ Picked as Best Film Of '70 by Critics for Magazines
“M*A*S*H,” the Korean war service comedy, was voted the best movie of 1970 by The Na tional Society of Film Critics in the fifth annual poll of the group, whose members repre sent 20 magazines and two newspapers. It is the first American‐made feature placed first by the or ganization, which announced its, choices at a reception yester day at the Algonquin Hotel. Previous best films were the French‐made “Z” (1969), the Swedish “Shame” (1968) and “Persona” (1967), and “Blow Up” (1966), made by Italy's, Michelangelo Antonioni in Eng land. Sweden's Ingmar Bergman became the Society's first three time winner. He was chosen the year's best director for his work on “The Passion of Anna.” He previously was named best di rector for “Shame” and “Per sona.” “The Passion of Anna” was a runner‐up to “M*A*S*H” in the best‐picture category. George C. Scott was selected as the year's outstanding ac tor for his portrayal of the title role in “Patton.” Glenda Jackson was named the best actress for her characterization of the liberated sister in the dramatization of D. H. Law rence's novel “Women in Love.” The critics also cited Chief Dan George, an Indian who played an aged Indian in “Little Big Man,” and Lois Smith, the wanderer in “Five Easy Pieces,” as the year's outstanding sup porting performers. Eric Roh mer was hailed as best scenarist for the script of his French ro mantic drama, “My Night at Maud's,” which he also directed, and Nester Almendros won best cinematography honors for two French films, “My Night at Maud's” and “The Wild Child.” The group gave special cita tions to Donald Richie and the film staff of the Museum of Modern Art for their retrospec tive of Japanese films, and to Dan Talbot, importer‐distributor and operator of The New York er Theater, for presenting mov ies that “might not otherwise have been available to the pub lic.” “M*A*S*H” Victory Narrow The critics vote on a point system under which three points are awarded to their first choice, two to the second and one to the third. “M*A*S*H” received 27 to the 25 points won by “The Passion of Anna.” Runners‐up were “The Wild Child,” (18); “My Night at Maud's” (16) and “Five Easy Pieces” (10). The voting members are Hol lis Alpert and Arthur Knight, The Saturday Review; Gary Ar nold, The Washington Post; Jacob Brackman, Esquire; Har old Clurman and Robert Hatch, The Nation; Jay Cocks and Ste fan Kanfer, Time; Brad Barrach and Richard Schickel, Life; David Denby, The Atlantic; Pauline Kael (chairman) and Penelope Gilliatt, The New Yorker; Robert Hatch, The Na tion; Joseph Morgenstern and Paul Zimmerman, Newsweek; Robert Kotlowitz, Harper's; An drew Sarris, The Village Voice; Stanley Kauffmann, The New Republic; John Simon, The New Leader; Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Vogue, and Bruce Williamson, Playboy.

250-> GYM GIVES THEME FOR MODERN DANCE
The gymnasium, long dis dained by older modern dancers as a skeleton in their perform ing closets, has found new favor with younger choreographers. On Saturday evening Seamus Murphy directed a team of dancers through the halls and pool of Queens College's gym nasium, in a work called “Fab rication: An Image Fracture.” The piece's chief attraction lay in its locale, particularly the pool, for who can resist a mysterious light under the sur face of the water. The dancers were called upon to run, strike static images, recite set speeches and make various noises ranging from a moan to a shriek. In the second and concluding section, much of the same material was repeat ed. The audience, seated on the floor of an exercise room, was invited to join hands and sway to its own beat. The piece had frequent longueurs but, as is the case with environmental works, the audience is beneficially alert ed to itself and its surround ings in ways that conventional dance performances do not ac complish. For a complete suc cess, that awareness should be combined with striking chore ographic images. For the most part, those were lacking. DON MCDONAGH

251-> Private Health Insurance Plans Urged
WASHINGTON, March 16— Leaders of the health insur ance business told Congress to day that the best means of fi nancing national medical care was through private industry. However, New York City unions complained that their members Were being short‐ changed and urged Federal coverage. Three executives of the Health Insurance Association of America, which represents 500 companies underwriting 90 per cent of the nation's private health insurance, told the Sen ate health subcommittee that the industry's Healthcare plan was preferable to “monolithic, bureaucratic,” Federal health coverage. Healthcare, which is similar to the Nixon Administration's health insurance proposals, would use a mixture of health insurance policies whose pre miums would be met by em ployer and employe contribu tions, plus the Federal payment of premiums for policies cover ing low income people, to fi nance care for almost all Americans. J. Henry Smith, president of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, estimated that if the plan were to go into effect now, it would cost $4‐billion more in Federal funds than the Government is now paying to meet the medical expenses of the poor and the near poor. Mr. Smith and Daniel W. Pettengill, vice president of the Aetna Life & Casualty Com pany, conceded, however, that the cost could be expected to rise substantially in future years as the breadth of coverage increased and medical care costs rose. The national health insurance program proposed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Mas sachusetts Democrat who is subcommittee chairman, and 100 other Congressmen would cost at least $40‐billion—per haps a great deal more—al though the personal health expenses of individuals would decrease. Support for the broader pro posal, which was introduced in the House by Representative Martha W. Griffiths, Democrat of Michigan, was given today by the New York City Hotel and Motel Trades Council, a member of the American Feder ation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. Mrs. Shirley Kronberg, direc tor of the New York group's Neighborhood Service Council, told the committee that “'pas sage of the Kennedy‐Griffiths bill is essential to meet the health needs of working people today.” Mrs. Kronberg displayed a series of hospital bills of low income and middle income union members showing that, despite Blue Cross and Blue Shield coverage, they still owed thousands of dollars after periods of illness. She related the case of a kitchen cleaner with take‐home pay of $84.33 a week, whose diabetic wife was hospitalized for seven weeks. The total bill was $5,895.95, of which Blue Cross and Medicaid covered all but $986.12. This led Mr. Kennedy to com ment on the “inadequate and fragmented coverage generally available from private insur ances.” He said: “To the insur ance companies, people are the enemy, because every private claim is a threat to corporate profit.” This was challenged by the insurance executives, who in cluded William C. White Jr., vice president of the Prudential Insurance Company of America. Mr. Pettengill of Aetna, while conceding that the overhead of health insurance policies taken out by individuals amounted to almost half the premiums, in sisted that the cost of adminis tering group policies compared favorably with Blue Cross. One privately underwritten health plan for Federal employes, he said, cost about the same to administer as the Medicare program. One squabble between Mr. Kennedy and the insurance ex ecutives occurred when the Senator repeatedly asked why their industry believed that it could control future health care costs when it had not been able to do so in the past. Mr. Smith replied: “Nobody —hospitals, doctors or insur ance companies—has been able to control costs.” He said the private compa nies lacked the power to con trol costs, but that provisions of the Healthcare plan would attempt to do so. The Health care bill has been introduced in the House by Representative Omar Burleson, Democrat of Texas, along with 16 cospon sors. Mr. Kennedy noted that the health insurance industry., had used the same arguments for dependence on private coverage during the struggle over pas sage of the Medicare Act six years ago. The executives said their industry did not favor dis banding the Medicare program, but that it also did not want to expand it to persons under 65 because “it's not necessary.”

252-> THOENI TRIUMPHS IN SPECIAL SLALOM
MADONNA DI CAMPIGLIO, Italy, Jan. 10 (AP)—Gustavo Thoeni, 19‐year‐old Italian ski ing ace, dominated both heats of the Tre Tre special slalom today for his first World Cup victory of the season. Patrick Russel of France fin ished third, high enough to take the lead in the Cup stand ing after seven events. Thoeni had the best times in both heats, each 480 meters long with a 172‐meter drop through 64 gates. He was clocked in 48.03 seconds on his first run and 47.12 on the sec ond for a combined time of 1 minute 35.15 seconds. Jean‐Noel Augert of France finished second in 1:36.26, with runs of 48.93 and 47.33 and Russel was timed in 1:36.3 (48.92 and 47.71) as the French widened their lead in the indi vidual and team standings. Russel has 80 points, in the World Cup standing, Augert 71 and Henri Duvillard, also of France, 69. Thoeni is fourth with 55. Rick Chaffee of Rutland, Vt., raised United States hopes with a time of 49.32 for seventh place after the first run, but faded to 14th with a 50.33 clocking on the second test. Eric Poulsen of Squaw Val ley, Calif., was 15th and Hank Hashiwa of Old Forge, N.Y., 18th.

253-> Webern Works Given By Chamber Society
Recent discoveries by Dr. Hans Moldenhauer have consid erably augmented the meager 31 opus numbers left by Anton Webern at his death in 1945. Two of these posthumous works, both for cello and piano, were introduced to New York by Lin coln Center's Chamber Music Society at its concerts Friday and Saturday nights. Neither is really a major ad dition to the Webern canon, but they do add to our knowledge of this important composer. The Two Early Pieces (1899), sup posedly the 15‐year‐old Web ern's very first attempts at com position, are characteristically brief statements, but uncharac teristically shot through with melting Schumannesque lyri cism. They are, needless to say, completely tonal and in a breathless romantic idiom. This bit of juvenilia was pre ceded by the “familiar” three Op. 11 pieces and followed by a recently unearthed Cello So nata, both composed in 1914. The Cello Sonata, first per formed last June by Gregor Pi atigorsky and Victor Babin in Cleveland, is only a fragment and a curiously tentative one at that; Webern was probably wise to discard it in favor of the Op. 11, a brilliantly incisive work. Laurence Lesser (Cello) and Charles Wadsworth (piano) gave all this material sterling performances. Continuing in a 20th‐century mood, the Society offered Wil liam Schuman's 1964 “Amaryl lis” Variations for string trio and, during the final measures, three singers entered unan nounced to intone the old Eng lish round that forms the basis of the work. It was an atypical ly introspective, slightly enig matic yet ultimately affecting effort by this usually direct and robust composer. The excellent performers included Charles Treger (violin), Walter Trampler (viola) and Mr. Lesser, with Benita Valente, Patricia Wells and Joy Blackett supplying the brief vocal phrases. Framing the concert were friendly romantic compositions by Dvorak and Brahms. The for mer's Moravian Duets, Op. 32 were deliciously voiced by Misses Valente and Wells, while Hiroko Yaiima (violin) and No buko Imai (viola) joined Messrs. Treger, Trampler and Lesser for a rather disappointingly tense and occasionally scrambled per formance of the Brahms Quintet Op. 111. PETER G. DAVIS

254-> Purported Hughes Letter Says He Backs Reorganization Plan
LAS VEGAS, Nev., Sept. 14 —A letter purportedly from Howard Hughes has assured Nevada state gaming authori ties that Mr. Hughes supports moves to reorganize the cor poration that operates his $300‐ million Nevada gambling em pire. Officials of the Hughes Tool Company today released the contents of the letter, which was delivered to Jack Diehl, chairman of the Nevada Gam ing Commission, last week in Fallon. The letter is handwritten on yellow legal‐sized paper. State officials have found latent fingerprints on the document but they say it will take a week to 10 days to determine whether they belong to Mr. Hughes. The State Gaming Commis sion on Aug. 26 denied Mr. Hughes permission to reorgan ize the companies that run his seven gambling casinos in Reno and Las Vegas. At that time the commission said it wants a personal interview with Mr. Hughes or a hand written fingerprinted letter with assurances that Mr. Hughes knows and approves of what is going on in his Nevada operation. The letter expressed irrita tion over the request of the commission. It said, “In this day of machine age it seems a little odd to be asked a letter of this length in longhand.” The letter was five paragraphs long. It said the billionaire indus trialist gave his full‐ support to Chester C. Davis, a New York lawyer, and to Raymond Holli day and Frank Gay, who are officers In the Hughes Tool Company. The letter said, “I also gave them a proxy to accomplish a reorganization in accordance with my desires as the sole stockholder of such corpo ration.” Mr. Holliday and Mr. Gay are licensed by the gaming com mission. Mr. Davis was turned down for licensing when the application for reorganization was denied. Mr. Davis said today that if the letter was verified by state gaming officials, he would prob ably reapply for licensing as a director in the umbrella cor poration, Hotel Properties, Inc. Meanwhile, the Nevada Su preme Court heard oral argu ments in Carscp City involving a $50‐million suit against Mr. Hughes and the tool company by Mr. Hughes's former chief of Nevada operations, Robert Maheu. Mr, Maheu was dismissed last (December after Mr. Hughes flew to the Bahamas from Las (Vegas. The suit argues that Mr. Maheu had been hired for life by Mr. Hughes and could be dismissed only by Mr. Hughes, not the tool company.

256-> News Analysis
WASHINGTON, March 16— The long‐submerged differ ences between Israel and the United States over the shape of a final settlement in the Mid dle. East were fully exposed to day in the almost simultaneous statements by Premier Golda Meir and Secretary of State William P. Rogers. Though neither country wanted it that way, the next phase of the search for a solu tion will involve negotiation between them rather than negotiation by them with the United Arab Re public and the Soviet Union. For Moscow and Cairo have made good on the demands that they subscribe to the goal of a formal peace agreement. By demanding now that Israel promise a withdrawal to the pre‐1967 armistice lines, they have kicked off a lively debate between the Israelis and the American Government and gained the benefit of polite but insistent American pressure on Israel. In the dispute, still amicable but potentially serious, the Americans and the Israelis dif fer on a number of important points. They disagree about whether Egypt is really prepared to move toward a peace agree ment, with the United States feeling that the chances of agreement may never again be so good. They disagree about the diplomatic role that the United States should play, with the Israeli's preferring a strong and silent partner while the Ameri cans aspire to backstage bro kerage between Israel and her Arab neighbors. They disagree most of all, as the day's statements showed, about the specific arrangements that would assure the greatest possible security for Israel. The Israelis contend that cer tain territorial strongpoints from which their land or ship ping has been attacked in the past must remain in their hands. The Americans main tained that in the conditions of modern warfare security is not a function of geography but of specific arrangements backed by international and big‐power guarantees. The Israelis insist that they have entrusted their fate to such guarantees in the past, with disastrous consequences. The 1967 war, they say, re sulted from the sudden dissolu tion of a United Nations peace keeping force on their Egyp tian border and the inability or unwillingness of the United States to honor its commitment to protect their shipping in the Gulf of Aqaba. In the discussions of a pos sible peace with Egypt, those differences have become quite sharp and specific on such is sues as the disposition of Sharm el‐Sheik, the strongpoint that dominates the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba. The Israelis insist on staying there in some capacity, with a land access route across the Sinai Desert. The Americans think an international force would suffice, especially if it included Americans as well as Russians to prevent any uni lateral withdrawal. In effect, Mr. Rogers is say ing, “Trust us,” and offering Congressional backing for the involvement. Mrs. Meir is say ing, “We will trust no one but ourselves again.” Beyond the memory of evapo rating pledges, the Israelis are haunted by the fear of Amer ican isolationism in the post‐ Vietnam era. They are also afraid that big‐power participa tion in a peace‐keeping effort will dissolve into “occupation zones” that encourage rivalry rather than cooperation, as in Berlin, and that big‐power supervision of arrangements like the demilitarization of Sinai will eventually lead to a greater rather than lesser Soviet mili tary presence on their frontier. In response, officials here are saying that they have learned from the inadequacies of past arrangements, that future peace‐keeping forces will never again be subject to recall or dis solution at Cairo's request and that American participation will be the strongest possible sym bol of commitment to the de fense of vital Israeli interests. Israel's refusal to withdraw from most territory occupied in the six‐day war, the Americans believe, will spoil the chances of agreement and leave her more vulnerable than before against a Soviet‐backed Egyp tian force vastly stronger than that of 1967. The Israelis say their stubbornness has brought them this far and will carry them even farther if only Washington will direct its pres sure against Cairo and Moscow. The irony of the argument is that the Israelis feel more gratitude to and confidence in President Nixon than any pre vious leader on whom they have had to depend. They value his judgement that Middle Eastern develop ments represent only one facet of a global competition between the Soviet Union and the United States, thus creating a link be tween American and Israeli mil itary interests. They are also satisfied with the extensive sales of military supplies in recent months, by which Mr. Nixon has sought to offset the new Soviet involvement in Egypt. But the Israelis do not feel secure about the simultaneous American interest in better re lations with many Arab na tions, and they have always been suspicious of the State Department's efforts to satisfy that interest by pressing for compromise between Israel and her neighbors. The question now is whether the basic Israeli‐American links are strong enough to contain the disagreement so that joint diplomacy can again be aimed at Cairo and Moscow or wheth er American officials, in frus tration or anger, will come to regard Israel as an obstacle to peace and their ambitions in the region. Foreign Minister Abba Eban faces a most delicate assign ment on his visit here this week. His talks promise to be only the first of a long and tense series.

258-> For Bridge Operator: Fear, Frustration and Boredom
“I didn't dare go out. It's bad enough when I have to raise the bridge on a normal morning. You should hear the abuse then. This morning? No sir. I wouldn't go out and talk to those drivers for nothing.” James J. Murray has been for seven years operator in charge of the Flushing Bridge, one of 29 drawbridges operat ed by the City Department of Transportation. The steel and concrete structure spans the Flushing River just east of Shea Stadium, and it funnels Long Island North Shore com muter traffic from Northern Boulevard to the Triborough and Whitestone Bridges and La Guardia Airport. The Flushing Bridge is one of the city's 29 movable bridges, all of which are important to its economy. Some 338 million motor vehicles and 908,000 rail road cars pass over them an nually. And they open an aver age of 42,000 times a year to permit the passage of 62,000 vessels. They are often small, unob trusive and taken for granted, except on a singular day like yesterday, when they stood open and jarred the city's nor mal course of business. Mr. Murray arrived at his bridge at 6:40 A.M., he found its two sides drawn apart and upright. Traffic was backed up eastward toward Nassau County, and the night operator, Julius Williams, was standing at the foot of the bridge, fright ened. Mr. Williams, he said, had been forced by three men to leave the bridge control tower 10 minutes earlier. “Julius told me these three guys came and told him to get out or they'd beat him up. He left. They raised the bride, then unscrewed the controls.” Mr. Murray pointed to a pair of threaded knobs from which the hand controls that regu late the bridge had been taken. “And they did something to the power,” he added. One of the three lights indicating that the bridge's power is on fully was out. Mr. Murray watched, he said, while policemen of the Flush ing Precinct gradually had driv ers back their cars away from the bridge, then rerouted them along Rodman Street to the Long Island Expressway and north to the Whitestone Park way. He said: “I didn't have the guts to go out and tell those drivers this bridge wasn't going to go down. You should hear what I get at 8 o'clock every morn ing when I have to put the bridge up to let the Cable Queen through.” The Cable Queen is a New York Telephone Company tug boat. Mr. Murray's day in his polished granite tower was one of frustration mixed with touches of wry humor and bit of fear. He received periodic calls from other bridge operators who had raised their bridges in sup port of the job action by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Mr. Murray has been in the Highways Department's division of waterway bridges for 26 years, and he was ambiv alent about the strike. “We've been working without a contract,” he said, “But this —” He said he had not been notified of any proposed action by his union and that “this idea of physically threatening somebody—no good.” He re ceived many calls during the morning, and often when he picked up the phone receiver, he said “hello” to an open line. “They're checking to see if anybody's here,” he said. “They” were “union mili tants.” Mr. Murray's attempts to re pair the electrical damage were unsuccessful. He chatted with the crew of the Cable Queen as the boat went through the upraised bridge, then stopped to permit the craft's diver to go into the Flushing River to check the company's submarine cables. But the rest of his day in the small tiled tower room was bore. “No cars. No traffic. No movement. No nothing,” Mr. Murray said. Shortly after 5 P.M. he went home. He had spent the day hoping that his bridge would be repaired. “There wasn't any sense in staying,” he said. There are about 300 men who operate the city's movable bridges—workers who average about 40 years of age. Their wages for a five‐day, 40‐hour week are $10,000 a year for those who bear the title of op erators, and $8,000 for assist ants. They work three shifts, around the clock. Some of the waterways crossed by the drawbridges are unknown and unheard of to many New Yorkers—Newtown Creek, English Kills, Dutch Kills, Little Lemon Creek, Go wanus Canal, Coney Island Creek, North Channel in Ja maica Bay. The movable bridges are of four types. Seven are swing or swivel types. Three are vertical lifts and three retractile (bridges that can be pulled back to the water bank). Sixteen are called bascule, for the man who designed them. These 16 bridges open like upstretched arms reaching to the sky. Because of the age of most of the spans, they require fre quent repair at great expense. This problem is accentuated by the increased traffic passing over them each year, as well as the larger size of the vehicles using them. The Highway Department has long‐range plans to replace all the movable bridges either by high‐level fixed spans or by setting them in a closed posi tion wherever legally possible. Coast Guard regulations re quire that drawbridges must be open when required in the in terest of safe navigation. Gov ernment permission would be required for permanent clos ings.

259-> Rent Cuts Threatened If Landlords Foul Air
Tenants in rent‐controlled buildings will be eligible next year for rent reductions, if their landlords violate the city's Air Pollution Code, city Rent and Housing Maintenance Administrator Benjamin Altman said yesterday. As amended in 1968, the code requires the upgrading of apartment heating plants or incinerators that cause pollution. After May 1, if a tenant believes that his landlord is violating the Pollution Code, he can complain to the district rent office, which will then ask the Department of Air Resources to certify the violation. If that is done, a rent decrease will then be processed, Mr. Altman said. The department has not yet determined the amounts of such decreases.

261-> Police Struggle to Unravel Massive Traffic Jams
Every available policeman was pressed into service yes terday in an attempt to miti gate the effect of one of the worst traffic tie‐ups in the city's history. Precinct patrol cars were di verted to city parkways and highways, tow‐trucks usually in service hauling illegally parked cars from Manhattan streets were put to work re moving trucks abandoned at key intersections by striking teamsters and private vehicles that had overheated or were otherwise disabled in the mas sive traffic jams. The police said the two worst bottlenecks yesterday morning were at the intersec tion of the Hutchinson River Parkway and the Cross Bronx Expressway, and at the Broad way and 225th Street Bridge at the northern tip of Man hattan Island. “Bruckner was a nightmare,” said Deputy Chief Inspector Frederick P. Kowsky, the top policeman involved in planning for yesterday's traffic crisis. Chief Kowsky said 25 men were assigned just to that in tersection. The 225th Street Bridge, which carries vehicle traffic and a line of the IRT‐Seventh Avenue subway, was kept in operation by the striking bridge attendants because they said train service was not an object of their walkout. But the strik ing attendants did close off the auto lanes. Later in the morning, the police opened the vehicular lanes by removing barriers, but not in time to avert a tie‐up that extended north in Broad way almost to the Yonkers line. Traffic was diverted west to the J. Henry Hudson Bridge and east to the Major Deegan Ex pressway and the Triboro Bridge until the 225th Street Bridge was reopened to cars and trucks. At the Bruckner interchange, long a source of traffic con gestion because of road con struction, traffic was backed up almost five miles into West chester County on the New England Thruway, the Hutchi son River Parkway and the Cross Bronx Expressway, which also feeds into the Bruckner interchange. The bridge out of service at the Bruckner interchange was the Unionport Bridge over Westchester Creek. The police diverted traffic around it to Westchester Avenue, but the crush was so heavy the tie‐up was not fully dispersed until mid‐morning. The traffic backup on the Cross Bronx Expressway; ex acerbated by a stalled truck on the West Side Highway caused another huge tieup, extending across the George Washington Bridge and several miles into Bergen County in New Jersey. Deputy Chief Inspector Fred erick J. Kowsky of the Police raffic Division, said his men had worked out a plan for yes terday's strike two weeks ago in cooperation with other city departments after receiving warnings that such extreme measures might be taken by unionists. Inspector Kowsky said police officials had “resurveyed” all the planned detour routes last Saturday. The plan was in ef fect 10 minutes after the strike began at 6:20 A.M. yesterday, Chief Kowsky said. A police department official said that extra police were on duty at most of the 27 bridges disabled by the strike before the morning commuter rush began. He said the policemen would be on duty again last night hut that the evening traffic peak was not expected to be as serious. “It's much easier to get rid of them than it is to bring them in,” he said. A Fire Department official said the department had ex perienced no complications yes terday, in part because he said the department had learned of plans for the strike and had prepared an alternative route plan two weeks ago, and in part because there had been no serious fires during the peak of the traffic tie‐ups. John T. O'Hagan, chief of the department, said that the critical area was the routes be tween Manhattan and the South Bronx, an area of high fire activity. As a safety measure, the de partment moved five fire com panies into the South Bronx early yesterday afternoon to supplement the 50 companies normally stationed there. Highway Commissioner Vin cent J. Gibney, probably the busiest man in the city yester day, ordered all street construc tion programs suspended to ease congestion but last eve ning, it was clear that only the lowering of the bridges could accomplish that completely.

262-> Connecticut Assembly Passes Lottery and Offtrack Betting Bill
HARTFORD, Tuesday, June 8 —The Connecticut House of Representatives yesterday passed legislation permitting a lottery and pari‐mutuel and off track betting. The vote was 140 to 31. Leaders of the Democratic majority in the Senate said they were confident the omni bus gambling bill would be approved in their chamber as it was in the Democratic‐con trolled House. Gov. Thomas J. Meskill, a Republican, is ex pected to sign it into law. Late last night and early this morning the Democratic major ity in the legislature gave initial approval to a budget and tax package that Mr. Meskill earlier said he would veto. Thus, two days before man datory adjournment of the Gen eral Assembly, Connecticut's legislative and executive branches appeared to be far from agreement on a fiscal pro gram for the coming year and a special extend session of the legislature seemed assured. At about 10:25 P.M. the House approved a budget of $1.072‐billion and at about 1:25 A.M. the Senate voted in favor of a revenue program in cluding a 10 per cent tax on in terest, dividends and capital gains. Both had been put for ward by the Democrats as al ternatives to proposals from the Governor. Mr. Meskill had called for a budget of 81.042‐billion and a sales tax of 7 per cent — up from the present 5 per cent— coupled with the elimination of a wide variety of exemptions. In both chambers the Repub licans tried unsuccessfully to offer amendments that would have substituted Mr. Meskill's proposals for those of the Democrats. Connecticut is currently op erated on a two‐year budget of $1.7‐billion. With the change from biannual to annual legis lative sessions this year, the state is also changing to a system of annual budgets. The State Constitution does not specify what action should be taken if the state's leaders fail to agree on a new budget by the start of the fiscal year on July 1. But state auditors believe it is likely that both houses would pass resolutions authorizing spending to be con tinued at present levels. In a new conference yester day, Governor Meskill reaf firmed his opposition to a state income tax and presented what he described as a compromise proposal to the Democrats. The compromise amounted to a slight modification of the fiscal package Mr. Meskill offered a joint session of the Assembly last February. Under the terms of his com promise, the Governor said, medicine, livestock, poultry, seed, materials and tools used in manufacturing and most per sonal insurance would not be subject to the sales tax as he had originally proposed. He also said he would con sider paying off the state's $262‐million deficit in at least two years instead of in a single year. William R. Ratchford, the Speaker of the House and one of the most influential Demo crats in the Capitol, immediate ly called the Governor's com promise “unacceptable.” In the sweltering halls of the Capitol yesterday, there were animated huddles of legis lators in shirtsleeves anxiously seeking a compromise fiscal program that could get through both houses and win the Gov ernor's signature. The legislators and the Gov ernor, in closed‐door sessions, had reached near‐agreement last week on a program that in cluded an income tax, but to day both factions appeared to be moving away from that solution. “I've always been opposed to a state income tax,” the Gov ernor said yesterday. “I said it would be a tax of last resort and I think we can still avoid it.” When the fiscal negotiations broke down last Friday, Mr. Meskill was reported to be willing to support an income tax. J. Edward Caldwell, the Senate Majority Leader, was held responsible for the collapse of the talks because of his op position to the income tax. Yesterday, Mr. Caldwell said that in the meeting he was “re peatedly asked to change my position ...” adding: “Now it appears the Governor was just playing games with us.” Over the weekend, the Re publican leaders had threatened to oppose the gambling bill be cause of a change in language, which shifted from the Gayer nor to the Democrats control of the commission that would oversee all operations. But as finally approved—aft er three hours of debate and considerable behind‐the‐scenes bargaining—the Governor dom inates all operations except li censing, where the Democrats will have veto power. Republican leaders in the House said that Senate leaders had tentatively agreed to pass the gambling bill without fur ther amendment and, in that case, the Governor's signature was assured. “There's some opposition,” said Charles T. Alfano, the speaker pro tern of the Senate, “but it'll pass.” During his campaign for Governor last summer, Mr. Meskill had responded favor ably to questions about gam bling and he included an esti mated income of $2.5‐million from a lottery in the budget he presented last February. The gambling bill leaves the details of how the various games will work to the commission.

264-> 18 HELD IN LOOTING BY BOULDER YOUTHS
BOULDER, Colo., May 23 (UPI)—A window‐breaking and looting spree that the Mayor called the worst in the city's history left 18 persons in jail here today. Policemen used tear gas and clubs last night to disperse crowd of 300 young people in a four‐block business section known as “the Hill.” Three po lice cars were heavily damaged in the disturbance. “We've had minor problems before, but this is the worst ottbreak I've ever seen,” May or Robert Knecht said. The Boulder police arrested 35 persons Friday night, many of them so‐called “street peo ple” who inhabit the area but do not attend the University of Colorado here. The deputy may or said there were indications that the incident had been “re taliation against the police force and the community.” Final examinations at the university were completed ear lier yesterday and most of the students had left the campus. “I'm greatly disappointed,” the mayor said. “We had prided ourselves on having a good record in the community until this.”

265-> Manchester United Is 1‐0 Victor Over Derby in Soccer
LONDON, Oct. 16, Reuters— The brilliance of George Best enabled Manchester United to gain a 3‐point lead today in the English Football League First Division. Best scored his 12th goal of the season to give Man chester United a 1‐0 victory over Derby County at Old Traf ford. Sheffield United was beaten, 3‐2, by Southampton but clung to second position as third place Manchester City also lost, 3‐0, to Leeds United. The big London derby be tween Arsenal and Chelsea ended in a 2‐1 triumph for Arsenal, its first victory at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground since the 1961‐62 sea son. Best's goal for Manchester came in the second‐half after United had dominated play be fore the interval without being able to score. The defeat ended Derby's un beaten streak this season. All five goals in the match between Sheffield and South ampton were scored before half‐time and the result rep resented Sheffield's third suc cessive league defeat. Southampton surged into the lead after only nine minutes of play on a goal by Mike Chan non. Ray Kennedy was the hero of Arsenal's victory. He put his team ahead with a pair of goals and it was not until the clos ing minutes that Peter Osgood scored for Chelsea when he hooked in Charlie Cook's pass. Tottenham Hotspur and Leds both won. Martin Chivers was among the scorers as Totten ham whipped the Wolves, 4‐1. Leeds, with Allen Clarke and Mick Jones back in the attack, produced some fine football to sink Manchester City, 3‐0. Clarke and Jones scored and Pete Lorimer added Leeds’ third goal.

268-> Clint Eastwood Is Star Of Siegel's 'The Beguiled'
Donald Siegel's "The Beguiled," which opened yesterday at the Cinerama and the R.K.O. 59th Street Twin Theaters, sounds simple enough on paper: Clint Eastwood, as a wounded Yankee soldier, charms and then terrorizes the ladies who nurse him back to health at a very peculiar, more or less forgotten, Louisiana seminary during the closing days of the War Between the States. Nothing, however, is as straightforward as it seems in "The Beguiled," not even its perversities.Take, for example, the lovely opening sequence in which a little, 12-year-old girl comes upon the body of the soldier in the forest. She is, at first, frozen with fear. Through her mind we hear her wonder whether her father died the same way. Cut to the soldier, and through his eyes we see a curious, shapeless child swim into focus.They talk, exchange names, and just before the child helps him to stand, he draws her down beside him and gives her a long, not really friendly kiss on the mouth. She's confused, but immensely happy.The film thus begins as a quite odd Civil War romance, evolves into a battle of the sexes in which the man is more vanquished than victor, and then turns into the kind of grotesque character comedy that might—mistakenly, I think—be identified as gothic horror. There is certainly horror in "The Beguiled," but it is played for what amounts to an extended, completely silent laugh.Whether this is intentional or not, I've no way of knowing, but there's no other way to explain the amusingly overripe excesses in a film by a man who has, heretofore, managed to make films that were more complex in effect and a good deal more simple in design ("Invasion of the Body Snatchers," "Two Mules for Sister Sara")."The Beguiled" is Mr. Siegel's 26th film, as well as his most ambitious and elaborate. I'm not referring to the sets, costumes and Spanish moss-hung locations (the exteriors were filmed in Louisiana at a fine, photogenic, old plantation), but to the narrative style. The movie employs, in addition to straight exposition, interior thoughts spoken on the sound-track, flashbacks that contradict spoken dialogue and the kind of fantasies commonly enjoyed—according to literary convention—by hashish smokers, sailors and sex-starved spinsters.In fact, every major character in the movie, with the exception of Eastwood, is a female suffering to a greater or lesser degree from the need for a man, including the little girl (Pamelyn Ferdin) who first finds the soldier, the precocious 17-year-old (Jo Ann Harris), who seduces Eastwood with the graces of Belle Watling, and the sweet virginal teacher (Elizabeth Hartman), who comes close to being an unequivocally decent person, the only one in the film.The most deprived (ergo, according to Hollywood Freud, the wildest and most dangerous) woman is the seminary's headmistress (Geraldine Page), whose initial flashback, as she stares at the bloody, maggoty soldier, is to the bed in which she and her brother made frenzied, slow-motion love. My favorite fantasy, however, is Miss Page's wine-induced dream in which she, Eastwood and Miss Hartman make love and then assume the positions of a pietà, more exhausted, I suspect, than sorrowing.This is very fancy, outrageous fantasizing from the man who gave us "Riot in Cell Block 11" and" Baby Face Nelson," and must strike horror in the hearts of those Siegel fans who've made a cult of his objectivity. "The Beguiled" is not, indeed, successful as baroque melodrama, and, towards the end, there are so many twists and turns of plot and character that everything that's gone before is neutralized. People who consider themselves discriminating moviegoers, but who are uncommitted to Mr. Siegel will be hard put to accept it, other than as a sensational, misogynistic nightmare.I must say that I found it interesting (even when it approached the ludicrous) because of its place in relation to other Siegel films and because I have nothing but appreciation for the performers, especially Miss Page, Miss Hartman and Mr. Eastwood, who, by simply reacting well, has become an important actor of movies.One final note: The screen credits list John B. Sherry and Grimes Grice as authors of the screenplay, adapted from the novel by Thomas Cullinan. Those are the pseudonyms, respectively, of Albert Maltz, who did the initial screenplay, reported to have been a romantic comedy, and Irene Kamp, who did the rewrite with help, I'm told, from Claude Traverse, the associate producer. This may explain some of the peculiarities of the completed film. The CastTHE BEGUILED, directed by Donald Siegel; screenplay by John B.

269-> A Plan to Muffle All Jets Draws Airline Opposition
An intense, emotional battle has been started by a Govern ment proposal that would re quire the nation's airlines to make airliners of the pre‐jumbo jet era quieter. The Federal Aviation Ad ministration, acting under a mandate from Congress, has is sued a notice that it is consid ering enactment of a regulation that would require “first gen eration” jets such as the Boeing, 707 and the DC‐8 to be muffled, probably by installing porous, sound ‐ absorbing insulation around the engines. Airport communities around the nation, usually with enthu siastic backing from local poli ticians and Congressmen, are pressing hard for enactment of the proposal. They say it could offer at least minimal relief from the bombardment of noise that they complain disrupts sleeping and conversation, ruins television viewing, and general ly makes life unpleasant near airports. “There has to be some re lief before there's a citizens' uprising,” William Goedike, the Mayor of Inglewood, Calif., said during a conference on aircraft noise and pollution here this week. Inglewood has had a long and bitter feud with Los An geles International Airport. “People are suffering,” May or Goedike said. “They are reaching the point that they're going to rise up and take some action that none of us want. This [the proposed engine muf fling] offers some relief.” Meanwhile, the airline in dustry, with private support of some key officials within the F.A.A. and the public support of the chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, Secor D. Browne, is vigorously fighting the proposal. The airlines contend that it would take five years or more to design and install insulation kits on their nearly 1,500 Amer ican‐built jets, cost up to $1‐ billion, increase operating costs about 5 per cent by adding weight to planes and, in the end, the insulation might yield such small noise reductions that the change would hardly be noticed on the ground. In 1968, Congress ordered the F.A.A. to set maximum noise standards for all civil aircraft. Late in 1969, the agency took the first step under the law, setting maxi mum limits for the new Boeing 747 jumbo jet and other up coming wide body jets that required them to be significant ly quieter than existing smaller jets. The engines of the new jum bos are twice as powerful as those in smaller jets, yet, they are quieter because a much greater proportion of their thrust comes from huge rotat ing fans, instead of from the combustion of fuel whose ex haust creates the familiar jet “roar.” Also, for the first time, sound ‐ absorbing insulation was used in the engine nacelle, or pod. Tests of a specially muffled, Boeing 707 and a DC‐8 have indicated the same type of ma terial, could cut the noise of older planes, especially the, screeching whine before land ing. Engineers said that noise might be reduced 5 to 8 deci bels — or, about 25 per cent below present loudness. These conclusions led to the aviation agency's notice early this winter that it was consid ering issuance of a rule requir ing “retrofit” of existing jets with the insulation. It asked the public for comment. The response, according to one official, has been “tre mendous,” with hundreds of let ters from jetport communities, Congressmen, and others urg ing enactment of the rule. The gap on the issue of noise between the millions of Americans who live near jet ports, on the one hand, and the airlines and many in the Gov ernment agencies that regulate them, rarely seemed wider than at last week's three day con ference on “Aircraft and Envi ronment.” Sponsored by the Depart ment of Transportation and the Society of Automotive Engin eers, it was attended by about 300 persons from affected com munities, conservation groups, airlines, airport management, plane builders, and state and Federal agencies. Community groups have blocked airport construction in New York, Boston, Atlanta and several other cities and the avi ation world has grown increas ingly concerned about the pub lic outcry over noise. The con ference was intended, in part, to improve relations between the opposing groups. Although many at the con ference agreed that they had learned more about the other side's point of view, most air port‐area residents seemed un impressed by the argument that the retrofit program would be too expensive to justify the limited noise reduction. And they seemed to have less awe for aviation generally than some aviation representatives. One official of a West Coast town said he nearly walked out of the conference when John H. Shaffer, administrator of the F.A.A., said proudly that the new 747 had already carried “the equivalent of the entire population of Ireland from Paris to San Francisco,” and publicly criticized by name a prominent opponent of the supersonic transport, alleging he had a “psychiatric problem.” Mr. Shaffer repeatedly pledged that the Nixon Admin istration would do everything possible to restrict detrimental effects of aircraft on the envi ronment, but he added: “I submit that in our zeal to improve the environmental qual ity we do not impose harsh, unreasonable penalties that will cripple or hinder the growth of an industry that has contribut ed greatly to the growth of our economy . . . and without which our nation could not de velop.”

270-> Misses Schut and Mittermeier Score at Japan's Pre‐Olympics
SAPPORO, Japan, Feb. 13 (AP) — Johanna Schut, The Netherlands' lone standard bearer, narrowly averted a So viet Union speed skating sweep and Rosi Mitternieir of West Germany edged out two French stars in the injury‐marred wo men's ski slalom today as Inter national Winter Sports Week, forerunner of the 1972 Olympio Games, neared conclusion. Miss Schut, only athlete from The Netherlands in the pre Olympic competition, defeated Tatjjyna Averina of the Soviet Union by one‐half second in the women's 1,500‐meter speed skating final after Soviet skat ers captured the men's 5,000‐ meter speed skating final after Soviet skaters captured the men's 5,000‐meter and women's 500‐meter events. The two gold medals brought Russia's meet‐leading total to seven. Miss Mittermeier shaded Annie Famose of France by 1/100th of a second, for her first slalom victory of the sea son on an ice‐blanketed course so treacherous that only a hand ful ofgirls finished both runs. Jocelyne Perrillat of France was third. Norway's Ingolf Mork won the men's 90‐meter ski jump; Marjatta Kajosmaa of Finland upset the world champion from the Soviet Union, Alevtina Olu nina, in the women's 10‐kilo meter cross‐country ski race; East Germans won the men's singles and doubles title, and West German girl took the women's singles in the luge competition. The token United States con tingent failed to land a medal on the next‐to‐last day of the meet, with a fifth‐place finish by 19‐year‐old Greg Swor of Duluth, Minn., in the ski jump the top performance by an American. However, Hank Kishawa of Old Forge, N. Y., was among the top contenders for the gold medal in the men's slalom test tomorrow. The final two runs of the men's four‐man bobsled compe tition and five speed skating events also are on the closing day schedule, along with the men's 30‐kilometer cross coun try ski test and the biathlon relay. A simple ceremony, to be at tended by members of Japan's royal family, will close the meet tomorrow night. Miss Schut, three‐time world champion at 3,000 meters, won the 1,500‐meter skating final with a time of 2 minutes 28 seconds. Miss Averina was sec ond in 2:28.5. Valery Troitsky of the Soviet Union took the men's 5,000 in 7:54.5. Vera Krasnova paced 1–2–3 Soviet sweep in the wom en's 500 with a clocking of 45.25 seconds. Miss Mittermeier, second in each run of the women's sla lom, earned the gold medal with a combined time of 100.78 sec onds, to 100.79 for Miss Famose and 103.97 for Miss Perillat. Britain's Divina Gallica in jured her left knee in a spill on the first run. Dominique Ma thieux of France and Ingrid Gfoellner of Austria also were hurt in falls on the icy slope. Rosi Fortna of Sugarbush Valley, Vt., missed a gate on the first run and was disquali fied after recording the fastest time, 100.40 seconds, on runs of 50.53 and 49.87.

272-> Familiar Stranger Is Best of Breed at Knickerbocker Dachshund Specialty
The Knickerbocker Dachs hund Club, a Manhattan‐based organization, held its first point show yesterday at the Hotel McAlpin. New Yorkers were conspicuous by their ab sence when it came time to pick up the winning awards. The top prize for best of breed went to Ch. Robdachs Familiar Stranger, a long haired red dachshund from El Cajon, Calif., owned by San ford and Patricia Roberts. The best of opposite sex was Ch. Museland's Alysia, a smooth from the kennel of Mrs. Dorothy A. Muse of Mountain City, Tenn. The No. 1 wire was Ch. Wilneen's Winnie of Way Hi, owned by Mrs. Dorothy Turco of Pompano Beach, Fla. Mrs. Robert V. Lindsay, the s??e‐in‐law of the Mayor, selected the best of breed. She was enthusiastic about the long‐haired, saying: “He moved beautifully and seemed to put out just a little more than the other two.” The event attracted 202 entries. Mrs. Lindsay also had kind words for the miniature dachs hunds, finding a great deal of quality among them. The Coast dog who on his way to the top prize, was named best long‐haired, has made a specialty of winning specialties. Three times in a row he was best of breed at the San Diego Dachshund Club's show, retiring the chal lenge trophy. The 5‐year‐old also won the silverware at the New Orleans specialty and the Pennsylvania Dachshund Club at Devon. Last year at the Dachshund Club of America's specialty, he was best of variety. He also took the purple‐and‐gold ro sette at Westminster last Feb ruary. “He's a housepet when he's with us in Fairfax, Va.,” said Jim Swyler, his handler, “and also when he's back with his owners in El Cajon. They have 15 dachshunds in the kennel but he has the run of the house. He's the particular pet of the Roberts' 7‐year‐old daughter, Stacy.” Alysia, a 20‐month‐old black and tan, was in her first big show as a special. She finished at Huntsville, Ala., last Octo ber, when she was shown by her owner. Yesterday, Bob Bar low did the handling. She gained her first major victory —a 5‐pointer—at the Connecti cut‐Yankee Dachshund Club specialty in June. The winning wire, a minia ture, who was 2 years old on Dec. 26, has had a sensational record. Shown for the first time when she was just 6 months old, Winnie picked up 3 points. She gained her title two months later at Raleigh; N.C., by taking the group from the puppy class. She has two all‐breed best in shows—High Point, N.C., and Miami, both in 1970—and has 39 group placements, 13 of which were first places. Ac cording to her handler, Richard Vaughn, Winnie is the top winning miniature of all three coats for 1970. WIRE‐HAIRED VARIETY ?? SMOOTH VARIETY ?? LONG‐HAIRED VARIETY ?? BEST OF BREED ??

273-> THE KINKS DRAW AN UNRULY CROWD
The British rock group, the Kinks, played Tuesday night at Philharmonic Hall before an en thusiastic and somewhat ag gressive audience. The Kinks are an above‐av erage band given to polite and pleasant songs about love or, a frequent theme, the bank ruptcy of middle class British life. Occasionally they produce a song of note, such as “Sun day Afternoon” or “Lola,” but their Philharmonic Hall appear ance allowed no great showcase for this material. The instruments were loud and a bit muddy; the vocals were so muddy that the lyrics were unintelligible. Ray Davies's voice could hardly be appreci ated, but, Dave Davies often produced guitar lines of some imagination. In all, it was pleasant affair musically, but the audience made it a bit sordid. Several dozen people clumped toward the front of the audi ence and insisted on standing throughout the show, smoking marijuana and turning to shout obscenities at anyone who asked them to be seated. By the end of the concert, several doz en people had crept onstage, a few of them playing with the vocal amplification speakers. At the concert's end, several hun dred crowded onstage and forced the group off. The sound of crunched microphones could be heard. One man walked up the main aisle spitting into the seats. The Kinks shared the bill with Trapeze, another British band.

274-> Planners See Risks for ’72 in Vietnam
WASHINGTON, April 7 —Senior military planners generally believe that President Nixon's announcement of substantial new troop reductions makes it clear that 1972 will be the riskiest year in Vietnam since disengagement started two years ago. The dwindling number of American servicemen in the war zone will be increasingly jeopardized, they say, and Saigon's ability to handle the major share of its own defense will be tested for the first time since the American buildup started in mid‐1965. As United States troop levels fall precipitously from about 300,000 today to what key planners say will probably be about 50,000 to 60,000 next summer, the South Vietnamese will be called upon increasingly to protect the remaining American troops and bases against attack. And as the few remaining American combat divisions are withdrawn the temptation may mount in Hanoi to try a major offensive next year aimed at demoralizing and possibly toppling the Saigon Government and undermining the Nixon Administration during a Presidential campaign. When the withdrawals began, President Nixon recognized these dangers and repeatedly warned the North not to take advantage of the American pullout. The controversial offensives into Cambodia and Laos and the three massive bombing strikes on North Vietnam starting last May, the planners concede, were meant to achieve more than the disruption of North Vietnam's supply system and a delay in any large enemy operations. The offensives, they say, were also aimed at convincing Hanoi that Mr. Nixon was willing to order harsh military measures — even though unpopular at home—to achiev his limited goals in Vietnam. “Next year, 1972, should provide the acid test for all that we have tried to accomplish over the last two years,” one official said. “Some people were afraid President Nixon didn't really intend to get out of Vietnam, but was shooting for some kind of military victory. Now, after tonight's speech, they must realize he means it. We're getting out. “But will Hanoi pull out all the stops to try to make it appear we're being driven into the sea? And if it does, will Saigon be strong enough, with our air support, to blunt any offensive?” he asked. Opinions vary widely on both questions. President Nixon tonight provided no clear answer. He suggested that the recent campaign in Laos should be more effective than last year's Cambodian operation in undercutting North Vietnam's ability to stage major offensives in South Vietnam. But as to when Saigon will be able to take over the full burden of its own defense, he said only that such a time “is in sight.” Some top Pentagon and White House planners are convinced Hanoi cannot move sufficient heavy supplies into South Vietnam to mount and sustain a countrywide offensive next year. An exception, many concede, may be in the northernmost provinces of South Vietnam, where Hanoi's supply lines are shortest and reinforcements nearest. A few analysts, however, insist that if Hanoi decides that the psychological impact of an all‐out offensive is of overriding importance, it might be willing to take awesome casualties, sending poorly supplied troops against South Vietnamese positions throughout the country. Most planners express confidence that the South Vietnamese could turn back such attacks, but this opinion was far from unanimous. In any case, it was recently decided not to return to the Saigon area many of the airborne and Marine units that participated in the Laos campaign but to keep them in the northern provinces. And some officials are hopeful that the implicit threat of heavy retaliatory bombing in North Vietnam will deter Hanoi from a large‐scale thrust into the South. Many planners say that Hanoi is more likely to concentrate on relatively smallscale terrorist and rocket attacks on military installations, particularly Ainerican bases, to demonstrate that it can maintain pressure on the United States to get all the way out of Vietnam. In order not to expose American units, there are plans to draw together the remaining United States air, artillery and supply forces Into a handful of secure areas. These would be mainly along the coast in places such as Danang, Camranh Bay and Tansonnhut air base in Saigon. Planners hope that South Vietnamese units will be willing to perform enough of the tiresome and often dangerous night patrols around these bases to prevent enemy sniper and rocket units from moving in close and inflicting heavy casualties on American troops. But they are not sure. Officials concede that no firm decision has yet been made on the precise size, composition or length of stay of the so‐called American “residual force” that will remain in Vietnam to help train and support Vietnamese forces. Will this force include tactical air squadrons, artillery battalions and helicopter companies in addition to trainers and advisers? Will it stay for a limited time, or until a deal has been made on return of American prisoners of war, or indefinitely? One defense official commented: “If by next summer the enemy is not able to pull off anything dramatic, and the South Vietnamese comport themselves well both in battle and in their presidential elections, if, in short, the Saigon regime looks viable, then Congress might very well support some sort of residual force for an indefinite period. “But if we find in, 1972 that despite all we've done, South Vietnam is not going to be able to hack it, than I don't think we'd want to keep a bunch of American troops sitting around in Vietnam like sitting ducks.”

275-> At Carnegie Hall, That Other ‘Boheme’
Leoncavallo's “La Bohème”? A misprint, surely. But no; as opera students know from books and even from records, Puccini's version of Parisian garret life, circa 1837, is not the only one. Still, who knows the Leoncavallo first hand, as a staged work? Until the Metropolitan Opera Studio and the National Orchestral Association collaborated on a concert presentation on Tues day night at Carnegie Hall, there seemed to be no record of even a concert perform ance here with orchestra. Reasons for the neglect are easy to cite. Puccini's opera reached the stage first, year ahead of Leoncavallo's, and its libretto more shrewd ly focuses on the doomed Mimi. Leoncavallo, who wrote his own libretto, gives all the best tunes to Musette, the frivolous soubrette, and her boy friend Marcello. A last act attempt to drag the drama together by suddenly turning attention to Musette's dying friend Mimi confuses the story for anyone who knows his Puccini. But such enjoyable con fusion. For most of this four‐ act, somewhat abbreviated version conducted by George Monseur, a plainly green but plainly gifted young man, “La Bohème” went from tune to tune in a simple‐minded but meltingly lyric way. One heard some Verdi, some Boito, a Massenet‐like canzonetta Bach even managed to insin uate himself, in the first‐act Cafe Momus scene. But with an affecting duet for Mimi and Musette in Act III, the score turned suddenly darker and more poignant. But, even when a turn‐of the‐century verismo style took hold, the crudeness that one might anticipate in neg lected Leoncavallo was never a problem in this production. The Musette, Theresa Tread well‐Carroll, happened to be not merely improbably hand some but musically and dramatically intelligent. Her velvety mezzo voice could sound tremulous, as if being forced a bit, bat Miss Tread well‐Carroll struck one as ‐a singer with an immediate future. So, in her briefer role, did Carole Farley. Though her Mimi lost some emotional conviction in the death scene, she perked up one's ears with the top notes of potentially important lyrico spinto soprano. At the moment, Miss Far ley's lower voice is no match for her top, and it lost qual ity in several patches. But keep her name in mind. She is young enough to do any thing. • Rodolfo, in this “La Bo hème is a baritone with not much of a part, but Brent Ellis made an excellent im pression in his one big aria. The Marcello, Melvin Brown, had problems with pitch a couple of times, and strained his light lyric voice too often. But he sang with elegance and sense, as did the others in the cast: Donald Chapman, Stephen Berman and Fran cois Clemmons. All in all, a most interest ing night, and one that must have led many listeners to wonder why there is not room for two “La Bohemes” in this world. As a prelude, strangely enough, Joseph Fuchs gave an occasionally awkward but musically solid reading of the Beethoven Violin Concerto, with Leon Barzin conducting.

277-> Mitchell Deciding Whether He'll Call A Kent State Jury
WASHINGTON, July 23—The Justice Department said today that Attorney General John N. Mitchell would soon announce a decision on whether to con vene a Federal grand jury to investigate last year's shooting at Kent State University in Ohio. Mr. Mitchell is expected to make the decision after he re turns next week from London, where he is attending the American Bar Association's an nual convention. A Justice Department spokes men said that officials “at the highest level” were still review ing the events surrounding the killing of four students and the wounding of nine others by Ohio National Guardsmen dur ing campus disorders on May 4, 1970. Former Assistant Attorney General Jerris Leonard, who conducted the Justice Depart ment's investigation until he left office as head of the Civil Rights Division in April, sub mitted his recommendation on possible Federal action to the Attorney General before his de parture, the spokesman said. He would not disclose Mr. Leonard's recommendation. Yesterday, a branch of the United Methodist Church re leased a report by Peter Davies, a New York insurance broker, which put forward the theory that a small group of guards men had agreed among them selves to “punish” students and opened fire on a signal. The Justice Department ac knowledged that it had re ceived copies of the report a month ago, but said that offi cials in the Civil Rights Divi sion had concluded that it con tained nothing new.

279-> Tubman of Liberia
William V. S. Tubman's long tenure as the autocratic but sometimes benevolent President of Liberia, now ended at 75, must be judged against the unique and checkered history of the African republic founded by freed American slaves. Given that origin, Liberia has never been able entirely to escape the stigma of being something of a ward of the United States. In addition, for the most of its nationhood, Liberia has been ruled by a tight little oligarchy — the so‐called Americo‐Liberians, descendants of the founders — that lived mostly along the coast and exploited the indigenous tribes without integrating with them to any great degree. These were formidable handicaps for Liberia to carry into the era of black African nationalism and the dramatic rush of African colonies to independence. Yet Mr. Tubman held his country together, steered it and himself into positions of influence in the new Africa, while taking care to contain — ruthlessly when necessary — the forces of African nationalism at home. Although often a major figure in the Organization of African Unity, he maintained close ties with the United States, opened Liberia wide for foreign investment and presided over a spectacular if uneven economic development. Possibly most important for Liberia's future, he did far more than any of his predecessors to bring indigenous Liberians into the economic and political life of the country. He did not leave an integrated society but he left significant beginnings. He did not eliminate the graft and nepotism that soon impress any visitor to Liberia; he was not a democrat. But he worked hard, with some success, at making himself a respected father figure at home and a man of his time in Africa and the world.

280-> McCarthy in the Race?
Three years ago Senator Eugene J. McCarthy ran for President primarily to educate the American people on the nature of the Vietnam war—a mission he per formed with a high degree of success. By all accounts he is thinking very seriously of running again, this time, it would seem, with the more commonplace objective of becoming President of the United States. It may be that the former Senator from Minnesota has been seized by that historic malady of American politics known as Potomac fever, or it may be that he feels a mystic call—a powerful one, it would have to be, to propel him into a score of primaries without benefit of either an extensive political apparatus or an appreciable campaign chest. In any event he does not seem to be acting this time under a simple compulsion to enlighten the voters. Whatever his motivation, Mr. McCarthy's credentials are as good as any other's, and the primaries could only be the richer for including the wry detachment touched by whimsy which is his special contribution to American politics. He may have no intention of donning Norman Thomas' old cloak of the perennially cheerful loser for the sake of a cause, but neither can he be regarded, on the basis of one defeat and a home in Minnesota, as the Democrats' Harold Stassen.

281-> Some Things Every Newspaper Should Know
“History is not woven with innocent hands,” wrote Lord Acton. “Among all the causes which degrade and de moralize men, power is the most con stant and most active.” The nation's newspapers took no notice of this proposition during the recent and unprecedented confronta tion with the Federal Government. For the first time in the history of this republic, the Government felt itself sufficiently powerful to move boldly into an area that the founders had expressly forbidden it to go. The path was paved to this historical crossroads by the very newspapers the Govern ment sought to prevent publishing the Pentagon papers. It has been The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Boston Globe that have consistently promoted on their editorial pages policies which have led to the enlargement of Govern ment power in the name of social and economic ends. These influential papers blindly refused to believe that one day such power might be turned against their own liberties. The re cent freedom‐of‐the‐press crisis calls into serious question, moreover, the widely held liberal assumption that powerful government can successfully coexist with individual rights and liberty. We who consider ourselves as libertarians have warned repeatedly that modern liberals take far too lightly the warnings of Thomas Jeffer son, Lord Acton, and Herbert Spencer that government is forever at war with men's liberties. The postmortem conducted by news paper editors and publishers after the Supreme Court's decision indicates less a genuine understanding of the foundation of press freedom and of all freedoms than an intellectual in toxication with pieties like “the right to know” and the First Amendment. Invoking such slogans and piously stating belief in the Constitution seems silly in the face of the tragic fact that the Federal Government can marshal enormous power and has helped set, with the aid of the courts, a precedent of press restraint. Illustrating that the words in our Constitution are only as strong a moral and legal weapon as the men who care enough to preserve and protect them over a long period of time. In the past, influential elements of the liberal press sanctioned or have remained silent when other provisions of the U.S. Constitution were openly violated. Why should they now be surprised that the First Amend ment has been openly assaulted by powerful government? Thomas Jefferson's statements in support of a free press enjoyed wide currency during the recent press‐ Government confrontation. Genuflect ing by the nation's press at the altar of the author of the Declaration of Independence, however, is of little help and is even hypocritical. Especial ly if newspapers and broadcast net works are willing to evade the lesson the late crisis teaches, a lesson that Jefferson himself never tired of re peating. “The natural process of things,” he wrote from Paris on May 27, 1788, “is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground.” In the last century we have seen the ac cumulation of a growing body of evidence to substantiate Jefferson's thesis. In recent times, moreover, the na tion's news media have chosen to blindly ignore repeated warnings. It was no accident, for example, that the recent confrontation between news papers and the Government followed by only a few months the clash between C.B.S. News and the executive and legislative branches over the tele vision documentary “The Selling of the Pentagon.” Not one newspaper has identified the relationship between these two events. While some news papers supported the C.B.S. fight un der the First Amendment, many evaded the essential point that C.B.S. News has already been placed in bondage to the Government by the F.C.C.'s power to license broadcasting. Most liberal newspapers have vigorously supported the F.C.C. and other regulatory agen cies. Ironically, The New YOrk Times, The Chicago Daily News, and The Chicago Sun‐Times are in a similar position as broadcast networks. On May 21 (three weeks before explosion over the Pentagon papers) the U.S. Justice Department filed a civil anti trust suit against all three newspapers seeking to forbid them to share a single wire service and sales agent that distributes news to some 338 sub scribers in this country and abroad. This is a clear violation of the First Amendment and strikes at the ability of all three papers to make whatever legal business arrangements they may wish that offers the potential toward making a profit. This case is all the more ironic since these three papers have editorially endorsed stronger en forcement of antitrust laws against other businesses. What this illustrates is the degree to which the alleged guardians of liberty—the press—have tried to divorce economic freedom from edi torial freedom. It also illustrates how men's minds have become confused about the fundamental principles re quired for a genuinely free society. The nation's newspapers have won the first of what promises to be future battles with a powerful Government that they have had a hand in creating. It would be tragic, now that the press‐ Government crisis has abated, if both newspapers and broadcast net works went back to “business as usual.” If they do, they should not be surprised to find in the not‐too‐ distant future that they have lost the freedom to conduct their own busi nesses.

283-> Books of The Times
Frances Fox Piven and Richard A. Cloward have written an irritating yet pro foundly interesting book on welfare, an achievement, considering the guilt and sourness of the reality and the usual tedium of its literature. Poor relief, the au thors suggest, is not systematic charity but systemic sanitation, clearing up the noisome statistical debris of recurring eco nomic crises. Miss Piven, a political scien tist and urban planner, and Mr. Cloward, a sociologist and social worker (they both teach at the Columbia School of Social Work), take the Marxist view of capitalist society in which the poor are the inev itable victims caught in the matrix of blind technological cataclysms and venal regula tion by political and economic institutions. Each capitalist crisis, they argue, is re solved at the expense of and with the use of the poor. Historically, they say, there is a cycle of poor relief: massive dislocation, massive discontent, direct relief, work re lief, end of massive relief. In the tempo rary stability that follows, the relief sys tem becomes a psychological and social threat that keeps the poor at work in a marginal labor pool. The authors offer three major historical illustrations of their thesis. The first is Elizabethan Poor Law, the origin of our present system and the first national sys tem of poor relief, devised as a response to the misery and rebelliousness of peas ants thrown off the land by agricultural enclosures. The Poor Law established work houses and residency rules that made pau pers a cheap source of labor and a perma nent threat to the working poor. Piven and Cloward find the same mechanism nearly 400 years later in the New Deal. Where President Hoover failed with local relief and outright repression of the rebellious victims of the Depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt succeeded, first with Federal Emergency Relief, and then with the work relief of the W.P.A. Within three years, by 1936, even that was being phased out. Except for the categorical assistance programs (to the aged, the blind and the otherwise unemployable) relief was once again localized. It declined sharply in World War Ⅱ, with the notable exception of veterans' relief, which has remained respectably vigorous to this day. The third cycle is that of the postwar American agricultural revolution and the subsequent “welfare explosion” of the 1960s. Between 1940 and 1960 one million farms disappeared. Twenty million people, mostly blacks from the South, left the land for the cities, mainly in the North, in the greatest migration since the flood of Europ eans entering the country in the late 19th century. Family structure collapsed. Black youth without prospects revolted, rioted in the cities, and the welfare rolls doubled. That this is a wretchedly simplistic model is, luckily, demonstrated by the authors themselves. Their theory may have usefully impelled them to look for the political meaning of poor relief (something social work teachers are not much given to doing), but fortunately they more or less abandon it in order to give a more orthodox and quite brilliant explanation of the explanation of the welfare explosion. To begin with, their relief‐cycle theory requires that the welfare rolls increased drastically because a flood of people be came eligible in the 60's, as a result of migration, the break‐up of families and the rise of formal benefit levels. But Piven and Cloward show that most of the migra tion had already taken place in the previous decade, and that while benefit levels rose by 50 per cent in that period, the number of recipients rose by only 17 per cent (in the South they actually declined, in some cities by half), whereas in the 60's, when benefit levels rose only 30 per cent, the number of recipients surged by almost 100 per cent. Furthermore, relief rose most sharply after 1964—at a time of the lowest peacetime unemployment and the greatest economic expansion on record. Why then was there no violent demand for relief in the 50's, as the authors' theory would sug gest, and why did relief expand so sud denly in the 60's when their theory would suggest the opposite? Despite their theory, the authors answer this question brilliantly. The 50's was a period of ideological sta bility and cold war. Memories of the De pression were still vivid. Rural blacks had no political know‐how. In discussing why they find that relief practice has been more restrictive even than relief law, the authors write that “the great majority of Ameri cans, although they have no direct eco nomic stake in the relief system, despise it. … The relief agency is their whipping boy; it marks and makes visible the de pendent poor, and is made to blame for the existence of these poor.” This has made relief administrators nervous, and, in self‐defense, they have developed an adver sary relationship with their clients. The authors give a devastating descrip tion of the routine degradation of welfare applicants—who in turn tend to accept the same implied evaluation of themselves. Until quite recently they rarely appealed decisions made about them—out of a wel fare population of 1.5 million in New York City in 1964 there were only 15 appeals, and in 1968 still only one‐tenth of the 150,000 families eligible for wage subsidies claimed them. The explanation of how this situation was radically changed is the most novel and valuable contribution of the book, and makes it indispensable for understanding the domestic politics of the 60's. In their account of the relief cycle of the 30's the authors concede that F.D.R.'s motives were governed as much by the building of the New Deal coalition as by any anxiety about rebellion. Similarly the Kennedy and John son Administrations were looking for a way to re‐establish that coalition, threat ened as it was by a South enraged by civil rights pressure and by the decaying cities where white ethnic machines fought black claims against urban renewal. The Demo crats had to find a way of enlisting the blacks without alienating the whites. The Great Society antipoverty program was the result. Capitalizing on urban un rest, the Johnson Administration bypassed the local‐machine politicians and in the community action programs directly fund ed a parallel ghetto politics. The softest accessible patronage was welfare—and much cheaper than housing or other pork‐ barrel rewards. The resources of the Fed eral Government in bureaucratic expertise, legal aid and money were combined in an assault on local welfare administration. In two years the Office of Economic Opportu nity spent $85‐million in litigation, with the result that the courts struck down one welfare restriction after another. Welfare rights organizations followed up. In 1968 alone New York City was forced to spend several hundred million dollars on winter clothing for recipients who had never be fore claimed it. Why, then, given this formidably con vincing interpretation of the welfare ex plosition, do the authors feel the need to retain their problematic theory of the poor relief cycle? They have been leading ad vocates of welfare rights for a number of years, and want to see the rolls tripled. By politicizing welfare in terms of rights they hope to cause a “systems‐break” and a re‐evalution of the poor as people, not trash. The authors want a predictive his tory on their side. But, as they have so ably demonstrated, in face of theories his tory is recalcitrant.

284-> STATE FACILITIES CALLED PHANTOM
HAUPPAGE, L. I., July 23— The former director of a state mental hospital that had a staff but no facilities testified today that at least three such hos pitals and five state schools exist throughout the state. The former director, Dr. James Brice, said he spent eight months in 1968 as direc tor of the South Beach State Mental Hospital on Staten Island, which he called a “paper” facility. He also told an Assembly subcommittee investigating the State Mental Hygiene Depart ment that other such hospitals existed in Albany and Elmira. He nodded in agreement as the subcommittee chairman, As semblyman Robert C. Wertz, Republican of Smithtown, read a list of five state schools, calling them “phantom” facil ities. Dr. Brice, who is now direc tor of the Suffolk Psychiatric Hospital, testified that during his eight months as director of the Staten Island hopsital he prepared a budget of $100,000 for the following year but spent three or four days of every week as a state inspec tor of private mental hygiene facilities while continuing to collect his director's salary of $37,500. He said that he did not know the current situation at the fa cility, which consisted at the time of a large plot of land on Highland Avenue, but he said he thought the facility was now caring for some in‐patients who were being housed at the Brooklyn State Mental Hospi tal. Attempts yesterday failed to learn how large a staff the South Beach center employs today and how many patients it serves. The other two hospitals iden tified by Dr. Brice were the Capital District State Hospi tal, at Albany, and the Elmira State Hospital, at Elmira. The five schools were identified as: Broome State School, in Broome County; Oswald D. Heck School, in Schenectady; Monroe State School, West Monroe Center School, and Williams R.O.T. Center School. No addresses were given for the last three.

285-> LETTERS
To the Financial Editor: I would like to add an opinion to the viewpoints concerning William McChesney Martin's findings. Donald E. Farrar contends (Aug. 29) that the study was not responsive to public needs (which call for more efficient, cheaper execution of trades), that rather than leave the market making to a non‐competing specialist system as the Martin study suggests, a better system would be to open the system to other dealers and to have commission rates competitive, as his (Mr. Farrar's) study for the S.E.C. suggests. John L. Loeb, on the other hand (Sept. 5), holds that Mr. Farrar's suggestions would leave the market making eventually dominated by institutions not currently members of the major exchanges. He claims this is detrimental to the interests of the public, especially small investors, because institutions, through eventual domination of the market, would obtain prices favorable to their positions but not to the small investor. Both Mr. Farrar and Mr. Loeb, I think, would agree that all investors, small or large, should have assistance of efficient service and reasonable rates. Mr. Loeb's contention of eventual institutional monopoly of the market place should be kept in mind, for no one trading interest should profit at the expense of other interests due to the market mechanism. But Mr. Loeb's criticism also can be made about his own interest group: the truth is that the membership structure of the exchanges charge exorbitant fees to all for execution of trades, and do so not because of excessive profit intent, but because the structure is run very inefficiently, and excessive fees must be charged for the structure's own survival. Mr. Farrar, on the other hand, seems to argue for a broader market ‐ making mechanism, involving more dealers and utilizing competitive commission rates. His broader mechanism is supposed to result in lower commissions and greater efficiency. Mr. Farrar's suggestions come closer to competitive structures of other businesses, but they also miss the mark: a modified version of the current system, letting more brokers deal in securities, does not give good assurance of inexpensive, efficient market making; perpetuating the old, primarily manual system will not lead to efficiency, and, as Mr. Loeb points out, the institutions may quickly monopolize the system and not assure inexpensive transactions for the small investor. I believe, however, the following actions are needed to make the market place perform efficiently and at low cost to all: ¶Total market automation: The market‐making mechanism must be totally automated. All investors should be able to secure immediate, complete service (not days or weeks) for transactions. This would mean the elimination of certificates, punched cards, and even monthly statements. ¶Direct investor trading: One investor should be able to inquire about stock information and transact a trade with another directly without the intervention of broker or specialist, at only the cost of telephone calls and computer inquiry, measured in cents and not per cents. This step is quite feasible now, as Raytheon has developed a computerized information retrieval system for the Amex specialists, and KMS Industries has a way of identifying, by voice or fingerprint, the owner of a credit card. Centralized, time‐sharing computer sys tems literally abound, today. Also, Comput‐A‐Phone has available order entry and retrieval from any touch tone phone in the country. This action would seem harsh to present brokers, as they do have substantial investments in memberships and offices. However, two stages of implementing this goal could be undertaken to assure the necessary transition to an efficient, inexpensive market place and yet safeguard the investments of the broker memberships. The first would consist of automating actions as listed above and below and allowing the exchanges' memberships en masse to receive, in proportion to present and expected profit rates (and to distribute to members according to present individual relative profitability), profits over an agreed‐upon period of time (long enough to pay back reasonable returns on invested capital). The second would involve the operation of the national automated exchange under a sole public corporation's direction (similar to the Post Office or Fanny May). The current memberships could be given options for part ownership of the public corporation. The corporation would be subject to S.E.C. and other governmental regulations.. Brokers should abandon or relegate market making to a minor position in their affairs, and should concentrate heavily on market advice. The rendering of good financial advice should be its sole fiduciary duty to Investors'. ¶Central credit for investors: To eliminate the problem of transferral of funds, a crediting agency linked to the exchange itself and similar in function to a bank or credit card agency, should be able to receive from; control, and dispense funds to investors for automated trading. When an investor wants to trade over the communications media, the exchange credit function should be able to inform him upon request of available trading credit, and make sure the investor doesn't trade credit limit. The time has come for a public securities utility. It is proper that the investment public receive much lower cost and more efficient service than it has received in the past. It is also proper to adequately compensate the stewards of the market place for the transition to the utility. Ballston Lake, N.X.

286-> Crisis at Volkswagen
BONN — “Sure, there is Ralph Nader,” said a young German businessman just back from the United States, “but despite his warnings most Americans seem to consider Volkswagen a swell automobile.” The young man belongs to that group of millions of West Germans to whom the malaise of Volkswagen, Germany's largest industrial enterprise, did not come as a surprise. Neither did it cause much amazement among the experts. The crisis of West Germany's automobile giant was long in the making and there is still much debate about which of a dozen factors played the key role in the ouster of Volkswagen's president, Kurt Lotz. His successor, Rudolf Leiding, is already rolling up his sleeves for a new start. He officially began his new job on Friday. To most West Germans, above all the car minded younger generation, the Volkswagen Company has been for years a giant resting on its laurels. They still buy VW Beetles because they are cheap but they would much rather get a fast Fiat, a powerful BMW or a sporty Mini‐Cooper. At least since the midnineteen‐sixties, when the legendary Heinrich Nordhoff was still at Volkswagen's helm, the exports were agreed that the blissfully snoozing giant would one day he harshly roused. Sooner or later, they argued, changing times would bare the vulnerability of a car maker relying excessively on exports and one model — the Beetle—which no amount of facelifting could rid of its antiquated design once ordered by Hitler in the nineteen‐thirties. Outwardly, things were still fine at Volkswagen when Mr. Nordhoff died in 1968. However, his successor, unblinded by booming VW sales here and abroad, sensed the gathering storm and, as a precautionary measure, rushed into a series of costly ventures aimed at quick diversification of the company's narrow production range. These measures, Including VW's takeover of Auto Union and NSU, two small West German auto makers, would probably have achieved its purpose had it not been for an avalanche of adverse events that hit Volkswagen since 1969. The first in a chain of devastating blows to Volkswagen was Bonn's decision in 1969 to revalue the mark by 9 per cent. The monetary change, which Increased by 9 per cent the price of West German goods abroad, depressed VW's 1970 earnings to about $55‐million from about $95‐million the year before. Throughout 1970 the company held its sales volume abroad—exports account for 57.5 per cent of production —but it could do this only through absorption of price losses at a time of mounting investments to finance new production facilities at home. Construction of a new plant to build an NSU‐designed four‐door sedan alone cost almost $100‐million. VW sales in the United States, 200,000 units in 1960, climbed to a record total of 570,000 in 1970. But there is no longer much hope that VW's 1971 sales in the United States will match last year's results, let alone set another record. Also in 1970, long before another set of adverse monetary changes, two other dangers began to loom on the horizon: Japanese competition and the United States' rigid safety laws, which would go into full force after 1975. It is generally believed here that these laws will make the Beetle practically unsellable in the United States after 1975. Volkswagen's current share in the United States automobile market is about 6.3 per cent. Japan's share grew from virtually nil to 2.6 per cent in 1970. In the first five months of 1971 Japan's share increased to 4.7 per cent. Volkswagen, which is reluctant to give figures, did not deny reports that in some European countries the Beetle's sales are waning even faster because of Japanese competition. In Norway, for instance, VW's share of the auto market fell to 10.8 per cent, while the Japanese, in barely three months of a large‐scale selling offensive, carved out a 14.7 per cent share of the market. The Japanese have yet to invade the German market but, because of the Germans' growing preference for Italian and French cars, VW's share of the home market in the first half of 1971 decreased to 23 per cent from almost 26 per cent in the first half of 1970. While worrying about mounting foreign competition, ways to absorb the effect of the 1969 revaluation and the financing of his diversification program, Mr. Lotz also had mounting wage and material costs to cope with. According to reliable reports, wage increases enforced by the powerful metal workers' union and rising costs for material caused Volkswagen additional outlays of about $145‐million in 1970 alone. In negotiations with the unions, management, riding the crest of a record year, found it harder than ever to resist the workers' demand for a larger slice of the pie. The unions listened to management's warnings that higher wages would harm West Germany's competiveness abroad and asked for more. Since Jan. 1, 1969, Volkswagen, as well as all other metal‐processing companies granted three wage increases totaling almost 25 per cent. The budding crisis at Volkswagen, whispered throughout 1971, surfaced soon after Bonn decided last May to free the mark from its official parity in an effort to blunt another speculative run on the hard West German currency. The revaluation effect of this action reached 11 per cent last week, when the value of the dollar on the floating market dropped to a record low of well under 3.30 marks. The 1969 revaluation had fixed the mark's dollar rate at 3.66 to a dollar. The final blow came in August, when President Nixon announced a 10 per cent surcharge on imports. Although Volkswagen, Germany's largest exporter to the United States, was spared the full brunt of the surtax —imported cars would also benefit from the excise tax reduction that Mr. Nixon suggested to spur the United States economy—the combined effect of the surcharge and the floating mark was bound to pose a thorny problem for the company, which is used to marketing one‐third of its output in the United States. In recent weeks spokesmen for Volkswagen and other West German exportoriented companies freely admitted that what they dreaded most was Bonn's eventual fixing of a parity for the mark that was higher than President Nixon's temporary surcharge on imports. Volkswagen has made it clear that it will be unable to absorb indefinitely the price‐raising effect abroad of a second official revaluation. At this point the surcharge's effect on Volkswagen cannot yet be assessed, a spokesman said, because autos subject to the new tax are only just reaching dealers in America. Asked about business in 1971, Volkswagen would merely say that in the period from January through August production Increased by II per cent and exports by 14 per cent from the comparable period of 1970. This would appear to be a comfortable situation for Volkswagen, but the company declined to estimate this year's earnings. There have been reports that it might be in the red by the year's end. Only through “tricky manipulations,” reliable reports say, would Volkswagen be able to report profits of $23‐million for 1971, compared with $50‐million in 1970: If true, this meager result would amount to no More than one‐half of 1 per rent of total business. Other West German car makers expect a 2 to 4 per cent yield on volume. On the day the board elected him as Mr. Lotz's successor, Mr. Leiding said that under his leadership hard work and determination would restore the battered image of the company. He did not disclose his plans but observers are sure that he will strive to rid Volkswagen of some of the costly ventures started by his predecessor and to accelerate at the same time the company's efforts to bring out new models of its own design. Charges by labor unions that Mr. Lotz, a self‐made man and World War II air force major, preferred to make decisions without consulting anyone and had an “authoritarian” leadership style played an important role in the former VW president's downfall. The Volkswagen supervisory board which controls decisions by the company's executive board, has been union‐dominated since 1969. It is considered an irony here that Mr. Leiding, the new VW president, has precisely the same reputation that was charged to his predecessor. Mr, Leiding, who has been with Volkswagen since 1945, is known to be a relentless “antreiber,” or driver, who rescued several faltering VW projects in the past. Mr. Leiding's last post was the directorship of VW's two‐year‐old Audi‐NSU subsidiary. Workers say that in his first week at the plant he turned up at 7 A.M. at the factory gate to reprimand late corners in the fashion of a “Prussian drill sergeant.”

292-> WORLD OF SEVENTH AVE.
It may have been slow In coming, but there is a marked improvement in the women's apparel industry, Seventh Avenue workshops are busy, even though the volume of business is not setting new records. But there has been a movement from low volume to high, with manufacturers now experiencing some difficulties in meeting orders. A surge of business was reflected in department store figures for the week ended Sept. 25. The Census Bureau reported that department store sales rose by 19 per cent from the level of the corresponding week in 1970, probably the largest increase this year. Significant in this gain is the fact that apparel sales also rose by 19 per cent during the week, after running ahead of last year's figures by an average of about 4 per cent for many prior weeks. There is no dominating theme in the purchases made by retailers, according to resident buying offices. Everything seems to be selling —suede coats, fake‐fur coats, fur‐trimmed coats, trench coats, short coats and fulllength coats, as well as jersey dresses, two‐piece dresses, long skirts and, remarkably enough, a lot of pant suits and dresses. A lot of the business is a result of special promotions in which price considerations are paramount, the resident buyers say. In other words, many stores are not primarily engaged in promoting fashion per se. Buyers made much larger commitments for fall than they did a year ago, when uncertainty on skirt lengths proved to be a devastating factor in the market. A profusion of price promotions, it has been said, may reflect some fears of getting stuck with the merchandise, particularly since two big fall apparen promtions this year come in the same month. Columbus Day, a traditional day for coat sales, falls on Oct. 11, while Veterans Day, which previously was observed on Nov. 11, will be celebrated on Oct. 25 this year. This could well leave the stores without a good selling handle, which they have always had early in November. Promotions before Thanksgiving Day, it was noted, are generally too late to be effective for coats. At any rate, coat production and sales are well ahead of last year. Sam Sandhaus, executive director of the New York Coat and Suit Association, said last week that union label sales were running about 40 per cent above the level of such sales at this time last year. Many individual members of the association, he said, are reporting substantial gains in their output figures. “There is some frustration,” he said, “in getting enough production to meet current orders. For one thing, there is a shortage of fabrics such as meltons and plushes, and some fur‐fiber cloths.” Mr. Sandhaus explained that many coat houses, after getting “burned” last year, did not take any deep position in purchasing piece goods. And there is a shortage of manufacturers who are capable of producing furtrimmed garments. “Some of those around,” he said, “are finding it difficult to get credit from fur dealers.” “I feel that from now until January, coat manufacturers will do very well,” Mr. Sandhaus said. “Many have told me that they are having the best season in years. This can be seen in the fact that there are few closeouts, and a large proportion of coat manufacturers will delay their spring production, although they will show spring lines, until they have taken full advantage of all fall and winter orders.” Mr. Sandhaus pointed out that there had been some heavy attrition in the coat and suit field. The association, he said, lost about 30 members after the close of the fall‐winter season last year. “Now we are starting to get new members,” he said, “and to me this is further proof that there is a revival in the industry.” Not only are there fewer manufacturers, he noted, but those remaining have found it necessary to reduce their output because of difficulty in getting inside labor or outside contractors to cut and sew their output. “There are no unemployed cutters in the coat field, he said. “If a manufacturer is fortunate enough to find one, he must pay premium wages or guarantee 40 hours pay for 35 hours of work.” Mr. Sandhaus confirmed that coat‐pants combinations are still selling strongly, after predictions that such garments had reached their peak last winter. The simulated fur coats are a strong item this year, according to Lou Nierenberg, president of the company that bears his name and that makes these garments for both men and women.” “We will have another outstanding season for women's garments,” he said. “The men's field, however, is not as good as last year.” Mr. Nierenberg said that manufacturers who had upgraded the simulated furs would have the best showing. There is a shortage, however, of better grades of fabric, particularly those imported from abroad. “The surtax on imports,” he observed, “is not helping the situation. The domestic supply of goods appears to be ample.”

294-> Jets Are Eloquently Silent On 2 Controversial Plays
Fined in the past for their outspoken comment, the Jets maintained official silence yesterday after viewing films of two controversial plays that affected the outcome of their game with the Baltimore Colts. From their silence, however, it was obvious they still disagreed with the officials’ calls in the 14‐13 loss on Sunday. At the same time, National Football League officials viewed a film of the game and one of them, Mel Hein, said they were not able to determine whether the Jets’ Gerry Philbin took the ball away from Tom Matte on a questionable play in the fourth quarter. “You could call Weeb [Ewbank] and I think he would say the same thing,” said Hein, supervisor of officials for the American Conference who also saw the game in person. “I believe he has the same film we saw.” But the Jet coach, when called, didn't say the same thing as Hein. “I just can't comment in any way” was all he would say. Thus, taken in relation with Hein's statement, Ewbank was most eloquent in his silence. The primary problem involved in the play appeared to be tre location of the referee, Fred Swearingen, at the time Philbin contends he swiped the ball out of Matte's hand as the Colt halfback attempted to pass. Philbin says he lost the ball when they hit the ground (the Jets’ Paul Crane recovered it and reached the Baltimore 25), but Swearingen ruled Matte maintained possession of the ball until he hit the ground, at which time the play was whistled dead. “The referee is behind the action,” Hein explained in between watching the film and taking calls from questioning Jet fans. “The ball is in front of Matte and the referee could be blocked out. It would be a hard call for him to make. But it's his call. He's the only one who could call it. None of the other officials was in a position to call it. “He may have missed whether the ball was loose, but we can't see the ball on the film we have. I looked at it 40 times and you never see him [Matte] juggle the ball. I called in Mark Duncan [N.F.L. director of personnel] and Art McNally [National Confercne supervisor of officials] and they couldn't tell either. “The only thing you see is Philbin hitting him, and when he hits the ground the ball scoots out behind him, toward the referee. Whether the ball was loose while he was up, you can't tell.” Initial Change Defined Hein said he didn't see the television replay of the incident but some people who did believed there was no doubt Philbin grabbed the ball before Matte hit the ground. The National Broadcasting Company, which televised the game, didn't keep a film of the game. As for the other controversial play, the one on which the Jets’ Gary Arthur was called for a personal foul against Sam Havrilak on a punt rush, Hein said he could not dispute the penalty. The call enabled the Colts to keep the ball instead of giving it up on the punt, and they went on to tie the game, 7‐7. Arthur said—and Havrilak confirmed—that all he did was give the Colt blocker an openhand slap on the side of the helmet, a legal maneuver if, according to Duncan, it's done on the lineman's “initial charge.” Asked to define initial charge, Duncan said, “If two guys are charging into each other, it's not even a step. But it would have to be within the first two steps made by the offensive or defensive lineman. If the slap is after that, a penalty should be called.”

296-> The man who's made ‘the most solid contribution to the arts of any President since F.D.R.’
WASHINGTON. ANTAL DORATI began his new career as conductor of Wash ington's National Symphony this season with Beethoven's Eighth and Ninth back to back in an authori tative performance that brought mu sical Washington to its feet cheering, in the belief that the city's golden age of symphonic music had now be gun. In recognition of the applause, per haps, a few days later Dorati was re ceived by President Nixon, who had not attended the opening and has not been to a concert since. He wel comed Dorati to the city, said politely that he hoped to take in a perform ance soon, and mentioned that he himself was very fond of music. Dorati, also polite, asked the Presi dent what some of his favorite com positions might be. One in particular, the President said: the background music by Richard Rodgers for the motion picture, “Victory at Sea.” Dorati confessed that he was un familiar with the work but resolved to look it up. He departed, presum ably to do so. The incident was illuminating as a kind of miniature model both of the President's attitude toward the arts and of the artistic situation in Nixon ian Washington. As a representative of Middle America in the White House, Nixon has an attitude toward the arts that is very appropriately one of benevolent indifference. He undoubtedly does think of the Rodg ers movie score as part of that higher sort of music that includes Beethoven and Dorati: after all, it re peats itself with variations instead of just repeating itself, and it cer tainly does go on and on, just like the music at Constitution Hall. As for artistic Washington in the Nixon years, the unspoken fact about Dorati and that golden age is that the conductor, by far the most sub stantial the town has ever had, is a moonlighter, or a split‐weeker, a part time Washingtonian. He is also con ductor of the Stockholm Philhar monic, which is quite a commute, both geographically and ideologically. Indeed, the passionate anti‐Nixonian might well assume that Dorati's other job was part of the reason the Presi dent missed the opening: the Admin istration deeply disapproves—to the point of withholding an ambassador for a year—the Swedish Govern ment's deep disapproval of our war in Vietnam. From a musical point of view, Dorati is used to playing for a royalist king and a Social Democrat prime minister, both of whom take a more knowledgeable and enthusi astic interest in his work than does the moderate‐conservative‐middle‐Re publican chief of state in his new part‐time hometown. Washington is used to commuters in the arts. By tradition a good part of Congress is only in town from Tuesday morning to Thursday after noon most of the year and the arts have followed the legislative exam ple. Arts consultants to the National Endowment for the Arts have been commuters from New York. Main line theater is still seen at the Na tional either before the New York opening or afterward with a road company. The chief native theater is Arena Stage, where nothing ever cheers everyone up so much as one of the local productions making it to New York, like “The Great White Hope.” When and if the John F. Ken nedy Center for the Performing Arts opens—it's now scheduled for next fall—the principal new resident at traction will be the American Ballet Theater, starring Soviet defector Natalya Makarova and commuting from New York. The art season here so far has been reasonably dazzling, owing chiefly to the National Gallery of Art, which keeps mounting one big loan exhibi tion after another, but the only ex hibition so far noted by Nixon was that of the portraits of John Quincy Adams, whose descendants, in town by platoons for the opening, were in vited to the White House that after noon and told by the President that he certainly planned to get to the show before it closed. (He didn't.) A couple of weeks ago, to be sure, the Nixons had some people in for buffet and Beverly Sills, but there was something surrealistically ap propriate in the fact that she popped a hook in mid‐Donizetti and nearly became the first topless soprano. LL of this falls into place in anyone's critique of Nixon as Middle American and therefore more inter ested in football than fugues, base ball than ballet, pinochle than play going, as the Vice President might phrase it. But while all that vigorous indifference was going on in the fore ground, there was background move ment and it went like this: When Dorati raised his baton to begin that golden age, the Presiden tial box in Constitution Hall, although not occupied by the President, was occupied by Leonard Garment, Presi dential aide for the arts, and Nancy Hanks, head of the National Endow ment for the Arts. Dorati was able to raise that baton only because Nancy Hanks had whomped up a quarter of a million bucks as an En dowment contribution to the sym phony, a contribution duplicated for   a number of other orchestras around the country, all of which are in finan cial trouble much more serious than the presence or absence of a Presi dent at a concert. Garment, for his part, is chiefly known around town as the man who staged the birthday program for Duke Ellington at the White House. The Duke is an artist by anybody's standards and jazz, like the movies, is an original American art. The insider‐cynics would have predicted An Evening in the East Room with Lawrence Welk, who, to be sure, may turn up there yet. The Nixon taste is, in a word, de plorable. Or, in a couple of words, there isn't any. A sweet singer of country songs, Johnny Cash, has been on board chiefly to sing of the “welfare Cadillac” that all good conservatives know is the goal, even the reality, of the left‐wing welfarists. Pearl Bailey has been there. Perhaps the key to the Nixon attitude toward the arts is to be found in a couple of appearances of Nancy Hanks. When Julie Nixon was sick, Miss Hanks was called in to act as hostess for a garden party: Item One. Item Two: She was also called in to be the judge of a pump kin‐carving contest at the White House. A pumpkin carving contest. Miss Hanks would instantly disavow the comparison, for obvious reasons, but it's a lit tle bit like Leonardo da Vinci's being asked to stage court masques and practical jokes for the in crowd at Milan and Amboise. The point of both incidents is that the mistress of the arts is also, ex officio, the mistress of the games. The two areas are hard to tell apart. More important still in any accurate estimate of artistic Nixington, a few months be fore that concert at Constitu tion Hall, Miss Hanks had, with a strong assist from Gar ment, got the President's ap proval of a big increase—al most double — in the annual budget for the Endowment and, with effective Adminis tration backing, coaxed and cajoled the boost through Congress. This gave the En dowment over $15,000,000 for the current fiscal year. This isn't much by the standards of the rest of the civilized world. In 1969, for instance, while this country was spend ing about three cents per capita on the arts, Austria was spending nine times as much, Israel was spending $1.34 a head, Sweden $2, and the Netherlands $3.69. In fis cal 1971, we will be up to seven cents, again not much in civilization, but a spending spree for us. Obviously the man ultimately responsible for this huge outlay is Richard M. Nixon. Moreover, he is doing it again: the first item leaked to the press from the budget for fiscal '72 is another doub ling, raising the Arts and Hu manities money to $60‐mil lion, half to each. N spite of this—the most solid contribution any Presi dent since F.D.R. has made to the arts—the received opinion in the art communities of New York and Washington and anywhere else where they think of it at all is that some how the great good time for the arts in Government was the brief Administration of John F. Kennedy, that Lyndon Johnson was an enemy of cul tural affairs as he was of the arts, and that with Richard Nixon the Presidential posi tion has become that of George Babbitt: hostile sus picion that the artist is trying to put something over on de cent people. That received opinion is based not only on careless ig norance of what is actually happening in the Govern ment's relationship to the arts in the Nixon years, but also on the haziest notions of what Presidential interest in the arts has been, could be or ought to be. Since the death of Roose velt and the somewhat earlier death of the W.P.A. projects in the arts, there have been, say, 40 potential Presidents in this country, the men who, in both parties, might conceiv ably have been nominated and elected. Of the lot, two—Eu gene McCarthy and Nelson Rockefeller—knew or cared anything more about the arts than does the most casual the atergoer or novel‐reader. John Adams acknowledged the American separation of art and state when he said that he studied politics and war so that his children might study agriculture and indus try so that their children might study painting and mu sic. The Adams family arrived at the arts right on schedule, or a little ahead, but insofar as his patriarchal projection applies to his successors in office, there has been a delay en route. Jefferson played the violin he had a Cremona, since lost—bought Italian pic tures by the yard, and took silhouettes with a small cam era obscura he purchased for the purpose. That was about the end of the line. When Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip visited the White House Mrs. Eisenhower and the Queen took in the opening of an exhibition at the National Gallery. Ike and the Prince stayed home and talked man talk, an arrangement that ac curately reflected the cultural division of labor in most American households where the question even comes up. Eisenhower painted, of course, but nowhere near as well as he played golf. In some ways the artistic high point of his Administration was the Christmas he sent out cards bearing color reproduc tions of a watercolor he had painted on top of a drawing by a talented enlisted man from a photograph of the White House. You lose count trying to figure the removes from reality involved there. The myth of the Kennedy Years as a kind of replay of the Medici Years in Florence apparently derived from two main events: having Pablo Casals in to play for a White House dinner party and the loan of the “Mona Lisa” from the Louvre, granted by Andre Malraux at another Kennedy dinner. For Casals, it was a return engagement; he had played there earlier, for Theo dore Roosevelt. It took rather less cultural imagination to have Casals the second time than it did the first. Similarly, the “Mona Lisa” is the pin nacle of an old‐fashioned, ro mantic taste, “the greatest picture in the world,” al though, by any serious stand ards, there are half a dozen better Leonardos, two of them in the Louvre, from which museum they might have been had for the asking as readily as the Victorians' fairy queen. The picture wasn't back in the Louvre before Malraux himself embarked on the mammoth re‐hanging which has ousted the “Mona Lisa” from its primacy of place in the Grande Galerie and rele gated it to a roomful of Italian paintings. Before Casals and the “Mona Lisa,” the first flirta tion with high culture oc curred at the inauguration itself, where, before the virtu oso demonstration of Theo dore Sorensen's mastery of the classic figures of speech, Robert Frost, New England's good gray poet of fences and woods in snow—posthumous ly revealed as something of an s.o.b.—delivered the sort of occasioned ode that used to reduce Tennyson and Mase field to rhymed journalism When they were England's poets laureate. It seems rea sonable to assume that Frost's presence was at least partly due not so much to the new Administration's love of poet ry as to its quest for legit imacy, or, in the word of the time, a “mandate” in the face of its skin‐of‐its‐teeth elec tion, a quest that may also ex plain, along with familiar style, the wearing of the tra ditional top hats by the Presi dent and his father in contrast to the modern Republican homburg worn by Ike for that transfer of power. LOTHING and culture had one more memorable coming together in the Kennedy Ad ministration. On The Night of the Mona Lisa—after all the farce of a poor political re porter forced to write dream interviews (so help me) with an imaginary Gioconda and the frantic display to the press, at the National Gallery, of the aluminum box the pic ture was shipped in—after all that and quite a bit more, Congress, the Court, the Higher Bureaucracy and the press all jammed into the west corridor of the National Gallery for the big event and, as the participants filed onto the trestle stage, it was seen that, while all the male mem bers of the audience plus all the Kennedy courtiers on stage were wearing black tie, Lyndon Johnson, alone and totally vulnerable, was wear ing midnight blue tails and white tie. He might as well have had brown shoes. Dinner parties do seem to form the nucleus of the Ken nedy interest in the arts. Even though it was a predominant ly scientific guest list, the dinner for American Nobel Prize winners got an arts credit from the piece de ré sistance of Fredric March reading unpublished Ernest Hemingway. The one serious arts involvement was Mrs. Kennedy's expert and thor ough redecoration of the White House. Despite her dis claimer, “It would be a sacri lege merely to ‘redecorate’ it —a word I hate,” that was what she did, bringing back historic pieces of furniture, wallpapers and fabrics so suc cessfully in her brief tenure that she was able at least to think about the next phase, the pictures, which has been ably realized by her succes sors. NATURAL extension of the re‐do of the White House did not work out quite that successfully. The subje?? ?as Lafayette Square. The early 19th‐century houses were scheduled for routine destruc tion by the General Services Administration, the Govern ment equivalent of Uris and Zeckendorf for tearing down good old buildings and put ting up ghastly new ones. The idea was to throw up needed new office space around that lovely square, the history of which encompasses Stephen Decatur and Henry Adams. Mrs. Kennedy stopped the G.S.A.'s vandalism, but did so at the cost of backing up the buildings with looming, prison like structures by a court favorite architect, John Carl Warnecke. The shells of the houses remain, but the casual, confused impression is that Jimmy Cagney has busted out of the Big House to seek ref uge in Colonial Williamsburg. President Kennedy also gave the Medal of Freedom to Andrew Wyeth, the realist painter. President Johnson, on the other hand, gave one to Willem de Kooning, the ab stract expressionist, while President Nixon, perhaps still trying to win that television debate from his old opponent, gave Wyeth an unprecedented one‐man show at the White House. The last sad memory of the Kennedy Years in art is to be found in the Green Room: the minor little Monet given by the President's widow as a memorial. Like most Monets of the period, the picture is lavender‐purple and looks gar ish against the green wall. It also conflicts irremediably with the long overdue and very successful effort begun by Mrs. Johnson and con tinued under Mrs. Nixon to hang the White House with American art, including the best Presidential portraits available and the best ex amples of the recognized American masters. The pro gram seems reasonable enough for the principal power cen ter of the American Govern ment, but as with the “Mona Lisa,” so with the Monet, art is something you get in France, like dressmaking. Beyond all compare, the most spectacular White House gesture toward or involvement in the arts was Lyndon John son's all ‐ day ‐ and ‐ half ‐ the night Festival of the Arts in 1965, and look what it got him. For most guests, the day was utterly delightful, the program a little full, perhaps, but varied and well‐paced. Robert Lowell's declining of the invitation was a dignified aloofness, well within the tra dition of his family and his region. John Hersey's reading from “Hiroshima,” his account of the first nuclear weapon used against people, was ir ritating only to super‐John sonians, including the Presi dent himself and those of his staff who believed him to have extra glands that led to better sleeping for staffers. But the performance of a cou ple of New York critics in circulating a petition against the President's war went well beyond the bounds of civilized conduct as guests in a man's house. Johnson was mad but concealed it remarkably well in his belated remarks of wel come. Mrs. Johnson was cer tainly distressed but carried on like the trouper she is, smiling, gracious, presiding, hospitable. The Peck's Bad Boys of the occasion doubtless concluded that Johnson's reported anger proved they were right, but you get a little perspective by imagining the reaction of Lorenzo the Magnificent if Botticelli had shown up at his festivities preaching peace with the papacy. The one time in this generation when a President went extravagantly out of his way to show friend ship toward the arts and to tell the country at large that art was an O.K. thing, he got bitten in the ankle by the ob jects of his solicitude. It will be a very long time before an other President invites the arts crowd en masse. If there is a certain separation be tween American art and American Presidents, it is not entirely the fault of the Presi dents. Specifically as an arts reporter, I first noticed the Nixons back in 1959 at the U.S.I.A.'s American Fair in Moscow. Arriving at the fair late for the grand opening tour by Khrushchev and Nixon, I found that Mrs. Nixon was also late. I followed her around the Buckminster Ful ler dome, inside of which the Charles Eames multiscreen vision of America was about to begin. She ran with quick, short steps from one door to the next of the circular build ing, getting no response from Russian guards, who did not recognize her or speak her language. Eventually, we both got in, but the image has lasted: a building housing the Technicolor vision of America, circular, all doors equal, all doors blank, the lady in high heels clicking them in vain from entrance to entrance, locked out with no key and no clue. It shows what can happen when an art critic is allowed to witness essentially political events. The other incident was in the other building, the ac cordion‐pleated one, scene of the biggest non‐event of the year, the Kitchen Debate be tween Nixon and Khrushchev, an encounter that possibly gave Nixon the false courage that led him into television disaster with Kennedy. The Famed Debate was one of those things, equally familiar in art and politics, that did not really come into existence until after it was over. But after it was over, the official party pushed on toward that part of the pavilion where the American exhibition of 20th century art was hung. The show was mildly con troversial. President Eisen hower had shown irritation at the inclusion of Jack Levine's beautifully painted, savagely conceived “Welcome Home,” a view of a general guzzling away at a banquet in his honor, the fruit salad on his chest all but dangling into the fruit salad on his plate as the official hero shovels it in and the marvelously refrigerated lady on his right endures. “‘Lampoon!’—Ike,” said the headlines of the day, missing the real point, which was not Ike's failure in art appreci ation but his hands‐off policy toward a picture he found both personally and profes sionally distressing. The pic ture went to Moscow and was on the wall as the Famed De bate concluded in the kitchen and the contestants swirled on toward the art section. On approaching the stairway to that section, Vice President Nixon steered his guest and debating partner off toward the home furnishings, noting, in the raucous whisper of which he is a master, that the show was all “modern art” and hence nothing for the Chairman to waste his eyes on. That was, sure enough, the Old Nixon. He wouldn't do it again. On the other hand, as President, he has had his daughters painted in a man ner suitable for a frontispiece to a particularly sickening Elsie Dinsmore novel, and has appointed one of them, Tricia, to a 10‐year term on the board of the Kennedy Center, another point, perhaps, in the eternal debate with the dead debater. center was conceived years ago as a kind of lyceum, a decent concert hall for vis iting troupes and artists, by Representative Frank Thomp son (Dem., N.J.). His bill was getting nowhere at all until the assassination of President Kennedy. In the national trauma that followed, The Washington Star, in a front page editorial, proposed nam ing the proposed center for the slain leader, arguing that this could be the finest pos sible memorial. The idea caught on and the bill, nomen claturally amended, sailed through Congress. Ever since, Washingtonians have watched the growth of the center with apprehension, equally worried that it will become the per manent home of the River City Marching Band and re vivals of “Springtime for Henry” by the Sauk Center Drama Circle, on the one hand, and, on the other, that it won't and their predictions will be wrong. Month by month, the chances increase that they will be wrong. Partly because the chairman, Roger Stevens, is determined not to let that awful fate overtake the cen ter but, more important, be cause Washington is slowly and reluctantly moving into reality as far as the arts are concerned. We are just about willing to admit that the arts are Good Things and even as worthy of Government sup port, on their appropriately more modest scale, as cancer producing tobacco and the building of ever more elabo rate, more costly and more unreliable weapons systems. Fifth‐century Athens is still a long way in the future for Washington, but at last we seem to be ready to accept the goal as neither frivolous nor subversive. The accept ance is something that Rich ard Nixon is uniquely well qualified to preside over. The President came into our public consciousness as an ex poser of Communists in Amer ican life. In those days, the chief sideshow of that par ticular circus was run by Con gressman George A. Dondero of Michigan and featured sen sational exposés of the fact that most artists, museum di rectors, critics and collectors were enrolled in a Communist conspiracy aimed at setting the country up for a Commie take‐over by “addling the brains” (Dondero's phrase) of Americans through exposure to “modern art.” With that attitude estab lished as one reasonable way to think about the arts, it is amazing that Nixon has any thing to do with them at all. How does he know that Dorati isn't an agent of Olof Palme, out to welfarize America by playing Prokofiev? It was re markable that he appointed Miss Hanks, a professional in her new field and a Rockefel ler Republican, to her job. It was dumfounding that he ap pointed her deputy, Michael Straight, to his. Straight is an immensely talented novelist and playwright, but he is also an old A.D.A.‐er, a found er of the thinking man's veter ans' association, the A.V.C., and the long‐time hereditary publisher of The New Repub lic. Predictably, Straight is do ing a first‐rate job, but it is a job that none of his fellow Democrats thought of for him in the Kennedy‐Johnson years. Nixon, impervious to charges of being soft on the A.D.A., could make that appointment with ease, even, one would like to think, with a certain pleasure in the multiple iron ies. N spite of Nixon's easy, automatic nonattendance of concerts and exhibitions, the arts are being taken seriously by the President in a way they never were by either of his two immediate predecessors, the only ones for whom art has been, in one way or another, a question of serious consider ation. For President Kennedy and the whole Kennedy gang, with the exceptions of Ken neth Galbraith and William Walton, the arts were a branch of the higher chic, woman's work just as surely as they were for Ike, sitting at home while Mamie and the Queen went to the National Gallery. Like the French lan guage, art appreciation was one reason welt‐raised girls were sent to finishing schools. For the Johnsons, art was something else. They took it, oddly, more seriously than the Kennedys ever did. They even believed in it, in a way, as Americans believe in public schools and freedom to attend the church of your choice, as long as you have a choice church. The Kennedys obvi ously knew that Andrew Wyeth wasn't very fashion able as a painter‐recipient of the Medal of Freedom. The Johnsons obviously knew that de Kooning was extremely so. Each choice, it is suggested here, was suggested there by considerations other than the sheer virtue of the artist in question. With Nixon, those marginal considerations of taste sink into insignificance, which is probably where they belong. The Wyeth show at the White House, besides being a top ping bid in the eternal debate, undoubtedly came about be cause the President and the First Lady simply liked the paintings of Andrew Wyeth very much, a thought that never occurs at all in think ing about the Kennedys and Johnsons and their Wyeth and de Kooning events at the White House. What is incalculably more important is the upping of the annual tab for the National Endowment and the making of the whole thing permanent. If anyone were going to chal lenge the Endowment serious ly it would have to be a Re publican leader—despite doz ens of culturally illiterate Democrats in Congress. No one did. There used to be a standard ploy in the House that went roughly like this: Isn't dancing one of the arts? Ayuh. Well, then, if the Fed eral Government is going to support the arts, doesn't that mean the taxpayers' money will be going into the cha cha‐cha? Chuckle, chuckle and a poke in the ribs and let's table the motion and send the bill back to committee. That kind of nonsense hap pened even to Roger Stevens, the last person in the world one thinks of as a cha‐cha cha artist. It didn't happen to Nancy Hanks—a more cred ible Latin dancer—and the reason it didn't was Richard Nixon, no dancer at all. The secret of the Hanksian success with yahoos from outer space is probably not in her personal style but in a discernible change of focus in the Arts Endowment pro grams under her rule. Her predecessor, Stevens, was noted for mammoth rescue operations: he saved the Amer ican Ballet Theater and he saved the A.N.T.A. theater and, through the new Ameri can Film Institute, he saved God knows how many only existing celluloid records of early great American movies moldering in their cans. He dealt, at least in the most readily available public and Congressional view, with met ropolitan art of the most met ropolitan kind. By contrast, Nancy Hanks, in addition to spreading all those tidings of funding and joy throughout the world of American symphony orches tras from coast to coast, has ventured into the hinterlands. Under her direction, there has been an orchestra on a flatbed truck playing for lettuce pick ers in the fields of California; there are art exhibitions shut tling on trains back and forth across Michigan; a bank in Grinnell, Iowa, is underwrit ing a sculpture garden—and that's not the half of it. The result of all this is that when Nancy Hanks speaks to Con gressmen of the import and impact of the arts, she is not talking about something in New York or Washington, but about something in their own backyards. They tend to take a second thought. E real beauty of the Nixon support of the arts in the Nancy Hanks ‐ Michael Straight world is that it is serious in the sense of that word in Washington, which means a dull, everyday, pain in‐the‐neck, inescapable bur den, like agriculture and the civil service. “How much do we have to give the arts?” is now a question, a real ques tion, like how much do we have to give Senator Eastland for not growing slaves, or whatever it is he doesn't grow for his two hundred grand Government handout per an num way down yonder. Nixon, the Establishment man par excellence, the per fect apparatchik even when he runs the apparatus, has in corporated the arts at last into the Establishment, a feat no earlier American President felt able to do. Brilliance we can wait for, it isn't impor tant, it's even deleterious. But that steady acceptance: that's the thing. The President's preference for the score of “Victory at Sea,” after all, was revealed to the leader of an orchestra which only the season before had performed the first, and perhaps the last, reading of a musical composition called “Eisenhower's Prayer,” by the orchestra's former business manager. There is something to be said for the separation of art and state. ■

Solid Waste Policy To the Editor: Recently, after some observations in Tokyo, the New York City Environ mental Protection Administrator made the news with two pronouncements. But, were they “new”? Item: He said that landfill opera tions in Tokyo made him think it might be a good idea to fill in the land between Hoffman and Swinburne Is lands. But, in March, 1968, the Regional Plan Association issued its report, “Waste Management” and on Page 77 there is a full page photograph with this caption: “Joining Swinburne Island (foreground) with Hoffman Island in Lower New York Bay by filling with treated and compacted solid wastes is under study by the New York City Sanitation Department. This is only one possible method of topographic modification.” Item: He said that incinerator opera tions in Tokyo led him to think that New York City might resume its in cinerator program. But, a Metropolitan Engineers Council on Air Resources Symposium in New York City last spring, an Air Pollution Control Asso ciation plenary session at its annual, meeting in June and a Mid‐Atlantic States Section Air Pollution Control Association meeting in October all dealt with the problems of solid waste and incineration and showed that, among other places, Chicago was go ing in for high‐temperature controlled incineration, with recycling and a steam adjunct. Does anyone know if New York City really has a solid waste policy? WILLIAM B. GROAT Chairman, Council of New York City Action for Clean Air Committees New York, Nov. 17, 1971

300-> U.S. Advisers Voicing Doubts on Saigon's Desire to Push Operation Phoenix
SAIGON, South Vietnam, Oct. 25 —Many American ad visers in the provinces are voicing doubt about the willing ness of Vietnamese officials to carry out the controversial pro gram known as Operation Phoe nix, whose Purpose is to weed out Vietcong politicaL leaders. “In this province ‘the Gov ernment will not allocate even a Pencil paperclip or piece of paper on a regular basis to the program,” according to Russell L. Meerdink, senior American adviser in Pluyen, On the cen tral coast. “It “Would seem that the problem is common,” he said in a confidential report on paci fication in Military Region. II, a coastal and highland area north of Saigon. “The low quality of person nel assigned to the program must also be considered some thing other than ‘coinciden tal,’” he added. He said it was the peroga tive of the Government in Sai gon to withhold support from the Phoenix piogi!am, but, he added, “Certainly the United States Government should not give the Government of South Vietnam the satisfaction of thinking it is ‘fooling’ the Amer icans.” The Phoenix Program, con ceived by the Central Intelli gence Agency in 1967, was turned over to the South Viet namese in principle the follow ing year. Americans have since pushed the program, providing advisers and funds as a pri mary means of seeking out the Vietcong. Under the Phoenix operating plan, each province receives a quota of Vietcong to be “neu tralized” each month, which can mean arresting a man, tak ing him into the Open Arms program, which accepts defect ors, or killing him. Since South Vietnam has not given the program the empha sis some American officials feel it should have, they are con sidering a reorganization of it and its basic concepts in the hopes of salvaging it. Lack of interest in or dis taste for the program is not limited to Vietnamese in Mili tary Region II. “There seems to be a de crease in the interest and em phasis in the program,” wrote the senior American advisor in Quangnam Province, which is in the northernmost military ragion of South Vietnam. He traced the declining interest to Saigon, where the failure to stress the program's impor tance has resulted in the re moval of many Vietnamese once vitally involved in it. Men trained exclusively for the pro gram are being removed with out replacement, the report on Quangnam said. The senior province official in Baclieu Province, on the southern coast, reported that the Phoenix program was ef fective against low‐level Viet cong but “Ineffective against the hard core” of the leader ship. Last August, in an attempt to bolster the program, the United Statas, and the South Vietnamese Government decid ed to begin experimental cash rewards in four provinces, pay ing up to ‘the equivalent of $11,000 for certain key lead ers. It is doubtful that the re wards are effective. Last May the senior American adviser in Binhtuy Province, 75 miles west of Saigon, said the primary reason for the lack of success was “the in herent distaste” of people for inducing relatives, friends of people with political connec tions. The quota system led to crit icisms here and in Congres sional hearings in Washington. “Volume rather than quality neutralization” became the pat tern, a senior adviser wrote, discussing the quotas. “Much of this can be attributed to U.S. guidance and influence and quotas,” he added. Testimony in Washington disclosed that American aid to the program from 1968 to May 1971, amounted to $732‐million. Current contributions have not been disclosed.

301-> Questions Over Kent State
Twenty‐five students of Kent State University have been told that they must stand trial for their alleged part in the 1970 campus disorders during which four students were killed by National Guard gunfire. The indicted stu dents have considerable grounds for questioning the course justice has taken, particularly since the grand jury report on which their indictments are based has been ruled illegal and improper. However, the Court of Appeals—though agreeing with the lower court's assess ment on the jury report—has let the indictments stand. Apart from the technical aspects of the case, the fact borne out by two court rulings is that the grand jury was biased, if not downright vindictive, in its attitude toward the university and the students. More important, Attorney General Mitchell has long since decided against any Federal prosecution of individual National Guard men in connection with the student deaths. Even though Mr. Mitchell acknowledged that the Guard's resort to gunfire was “unnecessary, unwarranted and inexcusable,” he contended that chances of proving personal guilt against any guardsman were virtually nil. Would it not seem logical as well as humane to admit that a conspiracy on the part of the students to threaten the lives of the guardsmen is at least as difficult to prove? One need not justify the student demonstrators' improper and provocative actions to question a judicial process that, having abandoned all efforts to act against military personnel directly responsible for four deaths, persists in the prosecution of students on the basis of a dis credited grand jury document.

302-> Sports of The Times
The Mets are back in town, but you a re advised not to rattle the dishes for a while because they came back with the world's worst headache. It seems like only yesterday—two years ago next month, in fact—that people were clamoring for Con gressional investigations to find out what had finally turned the Mets on. Now in a summer enlivened by Lee Trevino, Evonne Goolagong and Vida Blue, everybody's wondering what turned them off. True, they still might neutralize the St. Louis Car dinals, step over the Chicago Cubs and overtake the Pitts burgh Pirates in their final 67 games. But if they do, they will be even more amazing than in 1969, when men walked on the moon and Mets marched across the earth. There was no sign of disaster on June 28, when Gary Gentry pitched the Mets past Philadelphia. Nor on June 29, when Tom Seaver did the same. Nor on June 30, when Nolan Ryan beat Pittsburgh. That gave the Mets seven victories in 10 starts; put them 16 games over the .500 mark, and pulled them within two games of first place. But then came July, and the following things befell the Mets during the next time weeks: They were outscored, 96 runs to 64; they lost 16 of 19 games; the Pirates won 11 straight, and the Mets dropped 11½ games in the stand ings in the National League's East. Not only that, but Ray Sadecki became the only start ing pitcher to win a game (he did it twice, and Mrs. Joan Payson should name a race horse after him); Tug McGraw became the only relief pitcher to win a game, and Seaver became the only other pitcher of any kind to complete a game. Meanwhile, Jerry Koosman and Art Shamsky went on the disabled list. Gentry and Jim McAndrew collided, re quiring a total of 35 stitches. Tim Fob was spiked, re quiring 10 stitches. Bud Harrelson and Ted Martinez hurt their hands. Tommie Agee got a stiff neck. McGraw and Danny Frisella got sore arms. And Jerry Grote ran into a brick wall. But many teams get hurt and many others can't hit the long ball. And when the Mets look back on their long season, they will probably have to concede that—for all these reasons and more—their great young pitchers stopped winning. In 94 games, they netted just 30 victories from their Front Five—Seaver, Koosman, Gentry, Ryan and McAndrew. Which is the biggest stunner of them all. “In the early Sixties,” observed Ralph Houk, the man ager of the Yankees, offering the crosstown perspective, “I saw Baltimore's great young pitching staff come apart physically over a two‐year period. They had Chuck Es trada, Milt Pappas, Wes Stock, Steve Barber and Jerry Walker, and they all could fire. But that's the nature pitching: It's fragile.” “Let's face it,” said Ron Swoboda, who was a Met in good times and bad, “people keep saying a team is torn by dissension and all that. But things start to come apart for a team on the field first, and then maybe in the locker room. “The Mets have a high percentage of individualists. They got that way after winning in '69. And once things started to come apart on the field, personality became a factor. “If I were starting a baseball team, I'd go out and get pitchers. That's what the Mets did and they won the pennant. But they made the mistake of not building up a reserve. They thought the same five guys would last for ever. The Mets' defense hasn't been as good this year, either, but good pitching usually makes good defense.” “They're not exactly a team,” suggested Moe Berg, the onetime catcher and fulltime intellectual, bringing the Princeton mind to bear on the problem. “They're more a collection of individuals. They badly need a leader on the field—a player leader. “Seaver comes the closest, but no, pitcher can ever be the day‐in, day‐out leader. Bud Harrelson is probably the natural leader as the only regular of the infield, but he doesn't assert himself. They lack a regular who plays every day and hits every day.” Maybe the post‐mortems are starting early. But if the Mets need a lesson in history, they have to go back only two years to another July—when the magic was theirs. It's the same lesson the Yankees learned, and it was brought home to them at their oldtimers' dinner at the Friars Club two weeks ago. “We'll be back,” Houk told an audience that included Joe DiMaggio, Allie Reynolds, Yogi Berra and Casey Stengel. “because in baseball—as in most things—the line hem een winning and losing is extremely thin.”

303-> For Art's Sake
The artist in ancient times in spired his fellow citizens, enter tained them, educated them, helped them live more fully. The artist in modern times does the same, but has an additional responsibility: he or she must en courage others also to be artists. Why? Because technology is going to destroy the human soul unless we realize that each of ,us must be in some way a creator as well as a spectator or consumer. Tech nology has made it possible for one artist (musician, painter, writer, dancer) to reach millions. What about the artists now unem ployed? Don't let anyone lie to you and say, “They have no talent.” This is why I always ask audi ences to sing with me wherever go. As a musician, I am most proud that thousands have learned from me that it is fun to make your own music. This is why I urge all painters to show others that they need not always rely on the outside expert, the mass‐produced article. We should be showing people how they can be painting murals on garage walls, decorating garbage cans so that they are things Of beauty. Frankly, the young people are already doing this, and they are way ahead of us. They make their own clothes, decorate their own rooms, their cars, everything. Hooray. They also know that art and life and politics are so closely in tertwined that it is impossible to tell where one leaves off and the other begins. They suffuse each other. Hooray. Let us work for an America where the continual artistic ac tivity going on all around us is what we boast of, not the few outstanding works of genius. The latter are fine. Good. But they will mean little if we don't have all the rest going on at the same time.

304-> FILM‐TV COMPOSERS SCHEDULE A STRIKE
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 30—The Composers and Lyricists Guild, charging motion picture and television producers with fail ure to bargain in good faith, has scheduled a strike begin ning at midnight tonight. The 407 members of the guild, among them Burt Bacha rach, Henry Mancini, Quincy Jones and Elmer Bernstein, the president, say they will not write for movies or television until a contract is reached. But the strike is not likely to be noticed by moviegoers or tele vision viewers because the stu dios have a huge inventory of music. Negotiations between the guild and the Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers to replace a collec tive bargaining agreement that expires at midnight tonight broke off yesterday. The chief issue in dispute is a demand by the guild that its members be permitted to ex ploit their works when the pro ducers, who hold the copy rights, do not. The guild con tends that the publishing sub sidiaries of the production com panies neither publish nor ex ploit a vast storehouse of com positions except to promote the particular productions for which they were created.

305-> Stottlemyre Loses 5‐0 Lead In 7‐Homer, 32‐Hit Game
BOSTON, July 5—The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox played a friendly little game of cut‐throat in Fenway Park today before 23,364 cus tomers. The Yankees scored five runs off Gary Peters in the first inning, the Red Sox scored five off Mel Stottlemyre in the next two innings, and after that things got out of hand. Then Boston swatted its way through a six‐run sixth inning and fi nally won the bee, 12‐7. Between them, the teams got 32 hits that included seven home runs—by Gene Michael, Felipe Alou and Bobby Murcer for the Yankees, and Reggie Smith, Rico Petrocelli, George Scott and Joe Lahoud for the Red Sox. At that, the turning point in all the traffic—if a 12‐7 game could be said to have a turning point—was a call by the plate umpire, John Rice. With two down in the sixth, the bases loaded with Red Sox and the Yankees in front, 7‐6, Lindy McDaniel threw a sharp curve with the count 2‐2 that bent outside to Petrocelli. If it were strike 3, the in ning would have been over; if ball 3, Petilocelli was still alive. It was called ball 3 and, very much alive. Petrocelli socked the next pitch off the left‐field wall for a triple. Then, while McDaniel fretted over the perversity of fate, Scott and Lahoud hit consecu tive home runs and the Yankees came out of the inning trailing, 12‐7. But they had lost the lead twice before and had only themselves to blame. Michael opened the game with a home run into the left field screen and Alou, with two runners aboard, hit the screen farther out toward center. Then Danny Cater doubled. Bob Bolin replaced Peters and Stottlemyre singled for a one‐ round total of six hits and five runs. But the Yankees were about to be reminded that in Fenway Park, the hitter”s delight, it”s not the first haymaker that counts but the last. In the bottom of the first, before Stottlemyre could savor his margin, John Kennedy walked, Luis Aparicio singled and Smith hit No. 16 above the left‐field screen. Now it was 5‐3 and, one inning later, the lead disap peared after the Red Sox had loaded the bases with two down. The batter was Carl Yastrzemski, who had re covered from a one‐day virus infection following two home runs yesterday by his substi tute, Lahoud. The jeers that Yaz had been hearing during his recent slump became cheers when he singled to cen ter for two runs and a tie. In the fourth Murcer re gained the lead for the Yankees with his 15th home run of the year, a high drive into the right‐field bull pen with two down. But in the fifth Petrocelli hit his 13th over the left‐field screen and it was 6‐6. The Yankees, though, had one more gasp left. With two down in the sixth they made it 7‐6 on singles by Thurman Munson, Murcer and Roy White. But in the home sixth Stottle rnyre gave up a single to Kennedy, threw two balls to Aparicio and was invited to watch McDaniel work. Then Luis poked a hit‐and run single to right field, Yastrzemski walked with two down and Petigocelli fired the coup de grace off the wall in left‐center. YANKEES (A.) ?? BOSTON (A.) ??

WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 — Four nations accounted for nearly the whole of the previ ously reported United States godl loss of $299.6‐million in the third quarter of this year, the Treasury disclosed today. All but $1.5‐million of the loss took place before Presi dent Nixon “closed the gold window” on Aug. 15. The biggest single gold sale, announced at the time, was $191.1‐million to France. The other sizable sales in the third quarter included $20‐million to Finland, $50‐million to Switzer land and $30‐million to Singa pore.

307-> NEW TOOL ORDERS CONTINUE TO LAG
New orders for machine tools (the machines that build other machines) during the first nine months of this year totaled $626.05‐million, down 14 per cent from $729.2‐million in the year‐earlier period. During the first eight months they were off 16.7 per cent compared with the 1970 period. The decrease resulted from a drop in orders for metal‐cutting machine tools from $545.9‐mil lion in the initial nine months of last year to $437.5‐million this year. Orders placed by the builders of metal‐forming ma chines showed a slight increase, totaling $188.55‐million this year, compared with $183.3‐ million in the first nine months of 1970, the National Machine Tool Builders Association re ported yesterday. Shipments this year continue to lag behind those of 1970. In the initial three quarters of 1971, total shipments reached $748.6‐million, down from $1, 124,400,000 in the similar period of last year. This drop of 33 per cent reflected declines of 34 per cent in metal‐cutting and 31 per cent in metal‐forming machine‐ tool shipments. Although shipments were down sharply for the nine‐ month period, they rose 28.3 per cent in September to $80.25‐million from August's $62.55 million. In August, ship ments fell 3 per cent from the July total. The new‐order situation for September was mixed. Total orders and those for metal‐ cutting machine tools were down, while the orders for metal‐forming machine tools were up sharply. Total orders in September reached $75.8‐million, down 4 per cent from $78.3‐million in August. In August they had risen 1.2 per cent over July. Orders for metal‐cutting ma chine tools last month reached $49.85‐million, down 19 per cent from the $60.4‐million in August. However, orders for metal‐ forming machine tools rose 69 per cent from $17.9‐million in August to $25.95‐million in September. At the end of last month, the industry's over‐all order back log fell to $583.2‐million from $587.6‐million at the end of August as a result of the in crease in shipments during September. This backlog had in creased in the previous two months because of declining shipments in those periods. The mixed order situation in September appears to reflect uncertainty over whether the tax credit will be 10 per cent or 7 per cent and when it will become effective. Congress has not yet decided.

311-> Wedgies Revived
They used to be known as “landlady's” shoes and Woolworth's has been stocking them for 20 years. They have rubber soles and canvas tops and were bought mainly by older women because they were soft and comfortable. Now they've traded their little‐old‐lady‐in tennis‐shoes image and have become camp to the young. “Six months ago, I felt they were going to take off,” said Robert Campbell, a Woolworth shoe buyer. “They're wedgies and kids are crazy about wedgies—they have no memory of the original ones. They think they're great.” So great, in fact, that Mr. Campbell acknowledges that hundreds of thousands have been sold, although he is reluctant to feed competitive stores exact figures. The shoes are priced at $2.99 and originally came only in black, white or beige. This year, bright red was added. But the sleeper was a chintzy print on natural canvas, added rather reluctantly last year. The print is in the right mood for the pioneer‐woman's dress that's flouncing around the city this summer. The shoes are carried in most Woolworth stores, with the big store on 34th Street across from Macy's having the largest assortment of sizes.

312-> Rehnquist's Backers Say Critics. Have Begun a Senate Filibuster
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7—Critics of William H. Rehnquist vowed today that they would talk until their arguments caught the Senate's attention, and his supporters charged that a filibuster had begun. The strategy and concerns of both sides became apparent on the first full day of debate on the nomination of Mr. Rehnquist to the Supreme Court. Critics of the nominee droned through long speeches before a Vacant Senate chamber, and supporters kept themselves largely in the background. Mr. Rehnquist's opponents conceded that they had not yet been able to impress the public or the Senate with their fears that Mr. Rehnquist was dangerously insensitive to individual freedoms and civil rights. “We just have to keep hammering away at this until some of this gets through,” said Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, who is leading the floor fight against confirmation. Mr. Bayh delivered a one and one‐half‐hour speech that included a recitation of the pledge of allegiance to the flag. Later, speaking to reporters, he said that Mr. Rehnquist had a “Neanderthal philosophy” that would threaten constitutional freedoms. But he said the war in Asia and other events had distracted attention from his beliefs. Senator Bayh, a Democrat, denied any intention of staging a filibuster but said he would like to put the vote off until the next session of Congress if this would produce a thorough airing of the issues. Meanwhile, it became apparent that the Republican leadership had decided on policy of nonconfrontation with Mr. Rehnquist's critics, while accusing them of needless obstructionism and delay. Republican Senators stayed off the floor or remained silent, declining to take issue with charges made by the opponents who spoke today—Senators Bayh, Philip A. Hart of Michigan, John V. Tunney of California and George McGovern of South Dakota, all Democrats, and one Republican, Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts. All of them made much of the publication last weekend by Newsweek magazine of memorandum allegedly written by Mr. Rehnquist when he was a 28‐year‐old law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson. The memo argued that the “separate but equal” doctrine underlying racial segregation was “right and should be reaffirmed.” The Justice Department continued today to refuse to say anything about the memorandum or to concede or deny that it had been written by Mr. Rehnquist. Senator Scott told reporters that a comment about the memo would be forthcoming from supporters of Mr. Rehnquist. Beyond that, he would only hint that it might have been written in response to a request by Justice Jackson for a statement of the arguments in support of segregation. Senator Scott said that Senator Bayh was attempting a one‐man filibuster, and he said he had a closure petition ready for his signature whenever he concluded that the necessary two‐thirds of the senators would vote to cut off debate.

314-> Gulf and Western Profits Set a Record in Quarter
Operations of Gulf and West ern Industries, Inc., for the first fiscal quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, resulted in record earnings despite slightly lower sales, the diversified manu facturing and service company reported yesterday. Net earnings rose 11.1 per cent to $16,970,000, equal to 81 cents a share, from $15, 206,000, or 73 cents a share, in the three months ended Oct. 31, 1970. Sales dipped 0.8 per cent to $370,844,000 from the $373,787,000 recorded last year, which were restated to exclude sales of operations closed or disposed of subsequent to Oct. 31, 1970. Gulf and Western's equity in net earnings of such businesses is included in net earnings for the year‐ago period. Charles G. Bluhdorn, chair man, said improved earnings reflected a strong performance by consumer‐oriented divisions, paced mainly by financial ser vices, auto replacement parts and food‐products group. Para mount Pictures, however, had a slightly smaller profit than last year. The manufacturing operations as a whole were ad versely affected by the weak demand for capital goods, Mr. Bluhdorn explained. “Our 12 operating groups did well despite a variety of ad verse economic factors, includ ing higher costs that could not be offset because of the price freeze and a general reluctance on the part of businessmen and consumers to spend until they have a clearer view of Phase Two,” the G. & W. executive said. He expressed the belief that confidence would return once people saw concrete evidence that Phase Two was working and inflationary pressures had abated. Increased profitable opera tions of its Commercial Credit Company subsidiary enabled the Control Data Corporation to show third‐quarter consolidated net earnings of $1,154,000. or 5 cents a share, according to the report issued yesterday. In the similar three months last year the consolidated net earnings were $4,425,000, or 28 cents a share. Commercial Credit accounted for third‐quarter net earnings of $12,400,000, up from $9, 532,000 in the year‐earlier pe riod. Excluding such earnings, Control Data incurred a third quarter loss of $9,988,000, com pared with a $4,025,000 loss in 1970's third quarter. For the first nine months, consolidated net earnings rose to $26,348,000, or $1.74 a share, from $5,126,000, or 36 cents a share, in the like period last year. Of this combined net, Commercial Credit provided net earnings of $38,299,000 this year and $26,299,000 a year ago. Control Data, without its subSidiaries, had a loss of $8, 834,000, almost half the $16, 629,000 deficit sustained in the 1970 nine‐month period. The H. J. Heinz Company re ported yesterday that for the second fiscal quarter, ended Oct. 27, its consolidated net earnings were $11,235,000, or 74 cents a share, up 7.4 per cent from $10,465,000, or 71 cents a share, earned in the similar period last year. Con‐1 solidated sales rose 8.7 per cent to $300,979,000 from $276, 755,000. Consolidated net income for the six months to Oct. 27 reached a record total of $18,738,000, or $1.24 a share on an average of 15,016,180 shares outstanding. This exceeded by 7.1 per cent the $17,503,000, or $1.19 a share earned on 14,595,484 shares in the cor responding half year of fiscal 1970. Consolidated sales were $542,011,000, up 11.7 per cent froth the $485,182,000 volume in the six months a year ear lier. Lane Bryant, Inc. Lane Bryant, Inc., which op erates a chain of 164 retail stores and four mail‐order units, had record sales in the 13‐week and 39‐week periods ended Oct. 30, it was reported yesterday by Raphael Malsin, chairman. Earnings for the 13 weeks dipped slightly from last year but were up for the 39 week period. Net income for the 13 weeks was $1,802,400, or 41 cents a share, down from $1,844,300, or 42 cents a share, for the 13 weeks to Oct. 31, 1970. Sales rose 8.1 ber cent to $60,619, 437 from $56,080,682, bringing the volume for the 39 weeks to $179,497,992, or 8.9 per cent ahead of the $164,844,078 sales for the year‐earlier period. Net income for the 39 weeks increased to a record total of $5,179,000, or $1.18 a share, up 13.7 per cent from $4,555,400, or $1.04 a share, for the 39 weeks to Oct. 31, 1970. Provision for taxes amounted to $1,821,000 in the third quar ter, while taxes took only $1,660,000 a year ago. For the 39 weeks, taxes were $5,125, 500, compared with $4,502,600 for last year's period.

315-> JAMES TAYLOR SURVIVES FAME
JAMES TAYLOR SURVIVES FAME Publicity Hasn't Slowed His Growth, Concert Shows Monday night, at Carnegie Hall, James Taylor gave what was a very nearly perfect pop music concert. Perfect, because it was musically together, it touched the inner emotions, and it throbbed with infectious rhythms. After the wave of publicity that engulfed Mr. Taylor last winter, the question of his survival as a creative performer was open to considerable ques tion. He would not, of course, have been the first artist to have been smothered by a stack of press clippings. But Mr. Tay or has survived, all right, and survived magnificently. The Carnegie concert was a model of planning and execu tion. Each half of the program followed a similar pattern—a solo number or two from Mr. Taylor, the gradual addition of a few accompanying musicians and a final windup with a full panoply of electric rock with horns (and very good horns, indeed, from a group called Dreams). The dramatic effect was superb, an example of the kind of total evening's impact one rarely experiences at pop con certs. Remarkably, it was ac complished with almost no new material from Mr. Taylor. Yet many of the familiar songs— “Fire and Rain,” notably—were enhanced by beautifully crafted horn arrangements. Mr. Taylor's voice is matur ing slowly, becoming warmer in the lower register and less nasal in the high notes. His stage presence, as always, was that of a performer whose magic is .so strong it virtually radiates out of his electric blue eyes. Every move he makes— gawky lopes to the piano, sly glances at the audience, awk ward little bows of thanks— stamps him as an original. If he continues in his current direction toward the develop ment of a musical pacing that balances his native gifts, James Taylor's long‐term future as an I artist will be assured.

316-> Two Executives of I.O.S. Are Arrested in Geneva
GENEVA, Nov. 30—Robert L. Vesco, head of Investors Over seas Services, the mutual fund group, and Milton F. Meissner, a close associate, were arrested here today in connection with a complaint alleging miscon duct as directors of an I.O.S. bank. The unexpected arrest of the two Americans was ordered by Robert Pagan, a magistrate in charge of investigating the complaint filed by David Tucker, another American and a former I.O.S. sales manager. Mr. Vesco, who is president of the International Controls Corporation, of Fairfield, N. J. and Mr. Meissner, president of I.O.S., Ltd., the mutual‐fund group's Canadian ‐ registered parent company, flew here to day from New York in answer to a summons from the Geneva magistrate to appear for ques tioning. Lawyers associated with the complaint under investigation said that the two were expected to appear before a court to morrow for a preliminary hear ing at which bail might be fixed. Mr. Tucker, the lawyers said, alleged in his complaint that Mr. Vesco and Mr. Meissner were responsible for misappro priation of I.O.S. shares be longing to him and held in his account with the Overseas De velopment Bank, of Geneva, then a wholly owned I.O.S. subsidiary. The sale of Mr. Tucker's shares took place, according to the lawyers, at a time when Mr. Vesco was seeking I.O.S. proxies because of the fight he was then waging to retain con trol of the mutual‐fund empire against the attacks of a group of former associates of Bernard Cornfeld, its deposed founder. An attempt by Swiss mem bers of the Overseas Bank's board to oust Mr. Vesco and his associate as board members failed last July when they were unable to muster sufficient support to call a directors’ meeting. Last month the Geneva‐based I.O.S. divested itself of the overseas bank when it turned over all its banking interests to a bank‐holding company estab lished in the Bahamas under the name of International Ban corp Limited. Nevertheless, Mr. Vesco and Mr. Meissner continued as directors of the Geneva bank when its board was recon stituted shortly after. One Geneva lawyer expresses surprise tonight that Mr. Pagan should have ordered the deten tion of Mr., Vesco and Mr. Meissiner since the two Ameri cans had demonstrated that they were prepared to appear before him when wanted for questioning. “It may be that the Geneva investigating magistrates are getting a little tired of having to spend so much time on com plaints and counter‐complaints involving I.O.S.,” the lawyer commented.

321-> TUNISIA IS FACING LEADERSHIP CRISIS
TUNIS, Oct. 27 — Tunisia, long one of the most stable of Arab republics, is under going a serious political crisis as sickness and age gradually loosen the tight grip of her long established leader, Habib Bourguiba. President Bourguiba, who has ruled for 15 years, is 68 years old and critically ill with what is reported to be an ad vanced case of arteriosclerosis. The succession is an open question and a power struggle has begun among his followers. Nevertheless, Mr. Bourguiba has continued to demonstrate that he is still to be reckoned with. At a meeting Tuesday of the newly formed Political Bureau of Tunisia's ruling group, the Neo‐Destour Socialist party, the President reaffirmed his support of Premier Hedi Nouira by naming him the party's secretary general. He also had the Premier resign as head of government and asked him to form a new Cabinet. The President acted after the unrest that had long been sim mering in the country boiled to the surface at the party's eighth Congress, held last week at Monastir. It was the first such Congress in seven years. From it, Ahmed Mestiri, a 46‐year‐old frail and ascetic looking lawyer and politician, who has served as a min ister in several governments, emerged as the leader of a large group favoring democra tizing the party and liberalizing Tunisia's political life. This brought him into direct conflict with Mr. Bourguiba and those immediately around the President, notably Premier Nouira. Reacting swiftly, they suspended him from the party. At the same time, the con trolled press launched a cam paign against him, accusing him of menacing the unity of the country and of sedition. The President made it clear that he regretted having yield ed to pressure in allowing the Congress to take place. Last Friday he told the newly elect ed Central Committee that in stead of reconciling divergent opinions, the Congress “has merely made clear the division of the nation and brought into the open hostile clans.” He told the Central Commit tee that he, too, favored grad ual liberalization but warned against going “from one ex treme to another.” Mr. Bourguiba is said to be concerned, given the relatively low political maturity of the country, that too much democ racy would create the kind of instability and disorder that has afflicted other Arab coun tries. He is said to be particularly concerned about Tunisia's un comfortable position in North Africa. The country is sand wiched' between two military dictatorships, Libya to the east and Algeria to the west, and Mr. Bourguiba is anxious to continue a regime featuring a strong executive so as to be better able to fend off the country's neighbors. But since Tunisia achieved independence from France in 1956, the intellectual class has grown constantly in numbers and in restiveness as Bourgui ba, who was the leader of the independence fight, has main tained his authoritarian habits as chief of state. An economy that is poor in resources and gives few opportunities for a population growing at more than 3 per cent a year has aggravated the restiveness. As the principal spokesman for those favoring reforms, Mr. Mestiri pushed through the ,.Congress a strong resolution calling for collegiate direction of political affairs, for elections at all political levels, and “for an end to the practice of des ignation and choice.” At the opening of the Con gress, Mr. Bourguiba declined a suggestion that he be made President for life and instead said that he would withdraw when his term ended in 1974. He proposed Premier Nouira as his successor. In electing the 58 members of the Central Committee, the 1,000 delegates chose first the former Premier, Bahi Ladgham, who was dismissed last year by Mr. Bourguiba and has since been in disgrace. Second in the voting was Mr. Mestiri. Pre mier Nouira, despite Mr. Bour guiba's backing for him, came in sixth. A crisis developed immedi ately afterward over the meth od by which the Central Com mittee was to name the 14‐ member Political Bureau, the top executive group. Mr. Bour guiba has been accustomed to naming its members himself. At the meeting of the Cen tral Committee at his palace in nearby Carthage, the President made a concession by handing over to the members a list of 20 names acceptable to him for the Political Bureau. He told the committee that it could elect the 14 people front among those on the list. Neither Mr. Ladgham, nor Mr. Mestirl, the two most pop ular men in the party judging by the results of the election for the Central Committee, fig ured on the list. The 14 men named have an average age of 54 and repre sent an older generation that fought with Mr. Bourguiba against the French. Mr. Mestiri's followers de nounced the election later as “a masquerade.”

323-> Son Ange Placed First in Liberty Bill Dash on foul Claim
PHILADELPHIA, July 5 — Calumet Farm's Son, Ange took home the lion's share of the $58,850 purse for the Fire‐ cracker Handicap, the richest sprint in the country for older horses, after finishing second today at Liberty Bell race track. Son Ange, a 3‐year‐old racing against older horses, was moved up to first, after losing a stirring stretch duel by a nose to Bwamazon Farm's Well Mannered, when Eddie Maple put in a foul claim for interference in the stretch and was upheld by the stewards. Well Mannered was dropped to second. Howard Kane's Jerry Crow was a badly beaten third, 5½ lengths behind Son Ange. The time for the six fur longs over a fast track was 1:09 1–5, one‐fifth of a second slower than the track record. This clocking was the fastest here this year. The victory was the seventh in nine career outings for Son Ange, who increased his career earnings by $35,311 to $139,381. It was also Son Ange's fourth victory in succession. “I knew the other horse won,” said Maple after the race. “If the margin had been a length or more, I could have seen the stewards leaving Well Mannered up, but as it was I think the decision was right. He bumped me and pushed me over the rail through the stretch.” Most observers said the field for the Firecracker was the finest ever assembled for a race at Liberty Bell. It included such stake winners as Rollicking, Tyrant and Bushido in addi tion to Son Ange, Well Man nered and Jerry Crow, whose only two losses over the last two years have been at Liberty Bell. Well Mannered, on the other hand, had previously won two stake races at Liberty Bell, the Minuteman Handicap last year and a division of the Keystone. Handicap this year. Son Ange returned $7.40, $4.60 and $2.80 to his backers in the crowd of 17,123, which was the largest of the meeting.

327-> Stage: Irving Caesar Relives Career
In “A Bio in Song,” the first in this season's “Matinee Series” presented Monday nights and Tuesday afternoons by Lucille Lortel at the Theater de Lys, Irving Caesar plays Irving Caesar. The evening is not the standard “and‐then‐I‐wrote” with a songwriter eagerly hustling his old tunes, nor is the one‐man show a confessional, but it is personally revealing, and it is very entertaining. • The program lists 17 of Caesar's some 1,000 songs. With them as a base, he begins talking about his life in music, interpolating a song when he feels that it is appropriate. He starts with his casual entry into “No, No, Nanette” and how he came to write “I Want to Be Happy,” which he calls “the perfect Rotarian song.” He digresses about the profession of songwriting, inviting one into that ephemeral world of overnight failure quickly followed by overnight success. He makes one feel what it was like to be Irving Caesar in 1915—with a gift for versifying, a confidence (not conceit) and an open future. A BIO IN SONG, a one‐man show by and with Irving Caesar. Lucille Lortel, art. Istic director. At the Theater de Lys, 121 Christopher Street. Pausing to acknowledge the help on stage of pianist Robert Kroll, who closely shadows Caesar's stream‐of‐experience, he banters about the low status of the lyricist: he hardly ever gets the girl and he “always get the second table.” He offers anecdotes about Berlin and Gershwin, the Marx Brothers' father and Lou Holtz's mother. Although some are old, they all seem freshly told. The secret is that although Caesar is not a professional performer, he is a natural one. As he frankly admits, “If I couldn't sing songs I wouldn't write them. I'm giving myself material.” Perhaps his greatest pride is his facility. “If you're a songwriter,” he says, “you should be able to write any kind of song,” and “Sometimes I write lousy, but always fast”—“Tea for Two” in three, sleep‐fogged minutes. Zestfully he struts “Just a Gigolo,” loving the lyrics while mocking himself as gigolo. He does a saucy “Crazy, Rhythm” and a swaggering “Umbriago,” singing it like Durante, Jackson and Caesar (“That's myself,” he informs us as he drops the dialect). With equal conviction he introduces his songs of friend. ship and safety, those primerpure admonishments “Let the Ball Roll” and “Remember Your Name and Address.” And, to demonstrate that at 76 he is not entering his second childhood, he follows the children's songs with a hearty rendition of “Ladies, Ladies.” Intimate and affectionate, “A Bio in Song” is like having Irving Caesar as a guest for the evening. Could anything be nicer?

328-> For Colum at 90, Tributes and Memories of Ireland
ENFIELD, Conn., Dec. 7 — The Irish Ambassador came to Padraic Colum's bedside here today to pay his country's compliments. So did members of the American Irish Foundation, with a gift of $2,500 and a scroll hailing Mr. Colum as “Poet, dramatist, storyteller, collector of folklore and critic ... a master writer held in esteem, wherever literature is cherished.” On his 90th birthday tomorrow, Mr. Colum's thoughts are bound to turn back, as they do each day in his life, to his native Ireland and to friends such as James Joyce and William Butler Yeats and to pleasures such as walking down a Dublin street whille reciting lines from Byron In this alerted country, to which he came in 1914, he went on writing the poetry that dealt with the myths and troubles and delights of the homeland, and of his literary friendships. When Joyce wrote “Ulysses.” Padraic Cohan appeared in it as a pleasant poet. Mr. Colum returned the compliment by Joining forces with his wife, Mary (who died 1957) and writing a whole book about Joyce. “The best thing in life is getting married,” said Mr. Colum, sitting up in a bedside chair. “I regret very much the death of my wife, but I couldn't help this. She called me in to her room one day and said, ‘I think I'm dying.’ I said— what did I say?—what one usually says, ‘You're talking nonsense.’ She said, ‘I am dying.’” Mr. Colum had a stroke, in June, 1970, while attending the Writer‐Reader Conference at Suffield, near here. A Roman Catholic priest gave him last rites, but the poet stubbornly survived. The stroke left him paralyzed on the right side from his neck down; he could no longer write or focus on the printed page, and when he was transferred to the Parkway Convalescent Horne here he refused to talk to anyone. Edmund L. Krochalis and his wife, Jeanne Brown Krochalis, long‐time friends of Mr. Colum, came to read to him each day, beginning with poems he knew by heart. Mr. Colum dictates his memoirs to Mrs. Krochalis whenever he has the energy to speak aloud, and often it is for only five minutes. He speaks slowly and, with difficulty, and his voice is weak, as though the words set off on their journey long ago in a distant land. There is time for her to get everything down in long‐ hand, and when she reads the sentences aloud he has few changes to suggest. “The style is precise but informal, conversational,” she said, “as memoirs should be.” The other day he recalled a meeting with the poet George Moore about 1905. They were standing on the steps of Moore's house, together with the poet A. E. (George W. Russell), and Moore was reciting a limerick about neighbors with whom he was feuding. Unhesitatingly, Mr. Colum drew the lines from a memory that reached back some 65 years and whispered: “While my neighbors, the dirty Miss Drews ....” He and Mrs. Krochalis began their collaboration by preparing explanatory notes for an American edition of his poetry. One poem, “The Pilgrim,” is about Thomas Hughes Kelly, and Mr. Colum dictated a note to set him straight: “New York man—patron of arts, idler.” Another dealt with Ireland's 10th‐century Queen Gormlai. When Mrs. Krochalis suggested that he identify her, he said, “Oh Jeanne, everybody knows who Queen Gornilai is” “Who are you?” he whispers almost inaudibly when a new nurse arrives. “What's your name? Are you married? Do you have children?” He complains that his nurses don't read anything, but for St. Patrick's Day this year he wrote a poem of forgiveness, his only verses since the stroke: Padraic is Gaelic for Patrick, often pronounced. Porick, to rhyme with Yorick. Since this pronunciation might seem an affectation in America, Mr. Colum pronounces his name Padrick. He can think of no easy rhyme for it. ‘That's a terrible admission for a poet,” Mr. Krochalis said, and Mr. Colum smiled. Some days Padraie, Colum is prouder of his plays than of his poetry. He has often regretted severing his connection with the Abbey Theater; stalwarts such as Yeats felt the Abbey, should be literary, while Mr. Colum and others wanted it to be nationalist: He follows the current troubles in Northern Ireland and, asked about his views, said: “Well, I think both sides are wrong. The British are wrong for agreeing to the partition of Ireland, and the Irish for submitting to it. However, we won't talk about that.” As he reads the news accounts each day, his floor disappears under the pages he has finished. The walls are decorated with postcards from traveling friends. There are also two drawings, one of Killiney, outside Dublin, and the other of the tower at Seapoint, on the Irish coast, where Joyce spent a day. When Wiliam York Tindall of Columbia University, a Joyce specialist, retired recently, Mr. Colum wrote him a letter that said: “I think you and I are the oldest members of the Joyce Society. We have stood up to hear many preposterous interpretations of Joyce's intentions in ‘Ulysses’ and ‘Finnegans Wake.’ I had intended to ask you a question. Were you aware, or have I dreamt it myself, that Kettle Flatnose; King of Dublin, had come into ‘Finnegans Wake’ as Kettle Flashnose, whom Joyce and I knew as Tom Kettle's brother who was head of the Electric Power in Dublin?” Mr. Colum is president of the Joyce Society, and Dr. Tindall substituted for him at the meeting last week in New York at the Gotham Book Mart, 41 West 47th Street, as members recorded birthday greetings for their absent chief. The effusions will surely embarrass Mr. Colum, who has a sense of proportion. When he was asked why he had come to America and what his ambitions had been, he replied in his smallest, weariest voice: “Oh, it was to get on.” Then he looked up and added: “Suppose we call it a draw.”

329-> Troy Discloses Finances of His Political Group
Councilman Matthew J. Troy Jr., Queens County Democratic leader, disclosed the finances of his organization yesterday at a news conference and again called on the Mayor to order the John V. Lindsay Associaflans, the Mayor's political organization, to disclose their finances. Later, in response to a question, Mr. Troy said that the journal for the Queens County dinner last April contained some $100‐a‐page advertisefrom business concerns doing business with the city, but he added: “This was before I was county leader.” Mr. Troy said he was banning the future use of journals by the committee and called upon the Mayon to do likewise. There was no immediate comment from City Hall on Mr. Troy's statement. On Monday, Mr. Lindsay said the associations and other political groups should not accept political contributions from people or companies that do business with the city. His statement followed the disclosure by Mr. Troy last week that the Lindsay association in Queens had published a journal last February with paid advertising by a number of architects, engineers, construction companies and other having city contracts. Mr. Troy questioned the propriety of such advertising. In the accounting of the finances of the Queens Democratic committee, prepared by a certified public accountant, Mr. Troy disclosed that as of Nov. 30, 1971, the committee had a balance in their checking account of $43,106. The committee had received $23,185 from the advertisements in their dinner journal last April, $67,350 from their annual county dinner and $7,580 from their annual cocktail party. Expenses for these items was $28,386. “The people have a right to know where they [the associations] got their money and how they intend to spend it,” Mr. Troy said at the news conference at City Hall. “The Mayor should order his as sociations to file, with the Attorney General and with the Secretary of State, The Mayor admitted that they are political organizations, and he should order them to file.” Mr. Troy, who had said last week that he would divulge the finances of the Queens County Democratic committee yesterday and had asked Deputy Mayor Richard R. Aurelio to join him in the news conference to disclose the finances of the J.V.L. Associations, brought with him a brown leather chair for the former Deputy Mayor. Mr. Aurelio, who resigned yesterday to assess the Mayor's Presidential prospects, did not appear with Mr. Troy.

330-> Car Kills 2 Queens Boys Removing Dog in Street
Two boys were killed last night in a street in the Long Island section of Queens by a driver who was arrested and charged with vehicular homi cide and drunken driving. The police gave the following account: Three youths—Terry Colon, 12 years old, of 14–15 Tenth Street; William Corbett, 19, of 35–51 21st Street, and David Matos, 14, of 41‐01 12th Street —were attempting to pull dead dog out of the roadway at 21st Street and 38th Avenue, a heavily traveled intersection. A car driven by Robert Leach, 38, of 26‐25 Second Street in Astoria, operating without headlights, struck the Corbett and Matos youths, at 9:45 P.M., killing them. Mr. Leach was also charged with criminal negligence and leaving the scene of an acci dent.

331-> ECONOMIC POLICY SPLITS GOVERNORS
SAN JUAN, P. R., Sept. 14— Partisan squabbling over the Administration's new economic policy broke out In earliest to day at the 63d annual Gover nors Conference here. The Democratic Governors formally introduced a resolu tion, which had been outlined in general terms at a news conference last night, urging major modifications in Presi dent Nixon's program. “Actions and proposals ad vanced by the Administration fail to achieve our economic goals and fail to msure equity of either benefit or sacrifice,” the resolution stated. “The wage‐price freeze extracts the greatest sacrifice from the working man, the small busi nessman and the consumer.” After a caucus this noon, the Republican Governors returned the Democrats’ fire. “We simply deplore,” said Gov. John A. Love of Colorado at a news conference, “that the Democratic Governors are seeking to use this bipartisan conference as a forum for what we believe to be a narrow par tisan approach.” Noting that the Democrats had conceded last night that they had prepared their reso lution without benefit of de tailed research, Gov. Louie B. Nunn of Kentucky dismissed it as something produced “off the top of their heads.” He sug gested that the Democratic Governors were out of step with their party's rank‐and‐file. Senator Edmund S. Muskie, Democrat of Maine, had ex pected to discuss the economy in his speech at the conference tonight. But he scrapped his original text en route here, according to Richard Stewart, his press secretary, and instead decided to speak about the prison uprising at Attica, N.Y., and the deaths that resulted. The Senator, in an emotion ally worded speech, said “the Attica tragedy is more stark proof that something is terribly wrong in America.” Gov. Warren E. Heanes of Missouri, the outgoing confer ence chairman was the target of mild criticism for asking Mr. Muskie to speak. Gov. Forrest H. Anderson of Montana reportedly wrote to Mr. Hearnes before the meeting began, complaining that the in vitation was unfair to Mr. Muskie's rivals for the Demo cratic Presidential nomination. Other governors have grum bled since arriving in San Juan, and Mr. Love said today that he deplored the invitation “to some extent.” But he added; “I don't consider it too serious. The conference will survive it.” The Democrat's’ resolution called for the elimination of accelerated depreciation rates, immediate Congressional ap proval of and executive imple mentation of welfare reform and revenue sharing, temporary Federal grants to state and lo cal governments to make up for lost tax revenues, and the release of impounded Federal aid funds. “When the wage‐price freeze is ended,” the resolution add ed,” “guidelines should he carefully balanced to insure that restraints on wages and other personal income are ac companied by commensurate restraints on profits, dividends and interest rates.” The Democratic resolution, though toned down from an original draft, appeared to have no chance of adoption by the conference as a whole. No Re publican Governor showed any sign of willingness to back it. A three‐quarters vote will lie necessary to bring it to the floor. If it clears that hurdle, a three‐quarters vote will be needed to adopt it. Twenty‐five Democrats and 20 Republicans are expected to be on hand for the meeting tomorrow morning at which the vote will be taken. Nevertheless, the Democratic proposal tends to undercut the impression of bipartisan sup port that the President had sought for his program. Several Administration offi cials were in San Juan, in cluding Donald M. Rumsfeld, a counselor to the President: Harry S. Flemming, an official of the Citizens Committee for the Re‐election of the Presi dent: Harry S. Dent, a White House political aide, and Sena tor Bob Dole of Kansas, chair man of the Republican National Committee. Republican sources denied, however, that they were attempting to drop or modify the economic resolution.

334-> Maryland Hero Proves Answer To an Adman's Wildest Dream
Lofty Driesell has learned it pays to advertise. When he became the Mary land basketball coach two years ago with the promise to build the Terps into “the U.C.L.A. of the East,” he advertised in The Washington Post urging four outstanding high school seniors to choose Maryland. One of those players, Jim O'Brien, a red‐haired sophomore from Falls Church, Va., hit on an 11‐foot jumper with two seconds left in overtime Satur day night in Maryland's 31‐30 stunning upset of South Caro lina. The Terps advertised again before the South Carolina game. This time the call was for a peaceful crowd, with a $300 ad in the student news paper that urged “courteous treatment and gracious hospi tality.” South Carolina won the first meeting, 96‐70, and a brawl en sued in which the Maryland coach suffered a cut jaw. After that game Driesell said, “If I was McGuire, I wouldn't bring them here to Maryland for a rematch.” Maryland led, 4‐3 at half time in the rematch as the Terps and Gamecocks took only two shots each. Maryland re fused to tangle with the South Carolina zone defense and liter ally held the ball for all but about 20 seconds of the first 20 minutes. But the second half and the five‐minute extra session pro vided the sellout crowd of 14, 312. with one of the most un believable finishes in the his tory of college basketball. Maryland's taactics were not exciting, but they were success ful. The Terps made their slow down pay off with 15‐for‐18 floor shooting and only one miss in 13 attempts at the foul line. The regulation time ended at 23‐all. In the overtime, South Carolina led, 30‐25, with 14 seconds to go. Then O'Brien and Howie White, another soph omore, went to work. O'Brien scored four points and White made a key steal. Dick Sto baugh got the other basket, “It's not a World Series, it's just a basketball game,” said Frank McGuire, the South Car olina coach, who appeared con cerned that the behavior of the crowd led to his team's turn overs and the Maryland vic tory. “The crowd was as wild as any I've ever seen,” said McGuire. “I've played and coached all over the country and I've never had this kind of experience. We were promised protection leaving the court. They couldn't protect it. The boys were jostled and pum meled. I was whacked on the back four or five times.” Driesell said he intended, “a slow, deliberate” attack, not a complete stall, and that his team went to a slowdown when South Carolina refused to leave its defense. To make the night complete for Maryland, ththe Terp fresh men beat Villanova, 106‐66, for their ninth straight victory. The heralded Tom McMillen scored 41 points and grabbed 22 rebounds. South Carolina was the only team among the nation's top 10 to lose. The University of California, Los Angeles, routed Washington State, 95‐71, for its 11th success as Steve Patterson scored 22 points and his front court mates, Curtis Rowe and Sid Wicks, had 21 each. Dean Meminger staggered Xavier, Ohio, with a 29‐point performance as Marquette won, 91‐60, to run its winning streak to 23 games, 13 this season. Southern California remained unbeaten with a 79‐72 victory over Washington as Dennis Layton and Paul Westphal led the attack. In other games, Penn beat Dartmouth, 92‐77, for its 11th straight; Jim Daniels scored 24 points in Western Kentucky's 83‐64 triumph over Eastern Kentucky; Jacksonville crushed Miami, Fla., 124‐82; Kentucky overwhelmed Florida, 101‐75, and George McGinnis, an In diana sophomore, scored 38 points in his team's 101‐90 vic tory over Northwestern. Locally, Fordham made Holy Cross its 12th straight victim, 102‐78; St. John's downed Ha waii, 82‐76, and Columbia beat Brown, 79‐74, in an Ivy League game.

335-> Study of Adolescents Confirms Some Beliefs on Marijuana Use
A survey based on a na tional sampling of adolescents has confirmed several beliefs about marijuana use, among them that it is most common in the West and Northeast among middle‐ and upper‐in come youths from metropolitan areas. Frequent users of marijuana were found to be likely to have tried other drugs, and cigar ette smokers were far more likely to use marijuana than were nonsmokers. The one major finding that surprised the authors of the survey report was that girls were as likely as boys to have tried marijuana. The report, prepared by Co lumbia University researchers, I was presented yesterday in Newark to the First Interna tional Conference on Student Drug Surveys. It was based on household interviews of 498 youngsters 12 to 17 years old across the country, in what as believed to be the first survey of its kind on marijuana use. All told, the survey indicated that 15 per cent of Americans in that age group have smoked marijuana at least once and 10 per cent said they had not yet tried the drug but would like to. Nine per cent of the total sample said they had tried am phetamines, 7 per cent had used barbiturates, 5 per cent had tried glue, 4 per cent LSD and 1 per cent heroin. The most common form of marijuana use was “experimen tation”—use no more than nine times. Nine per cent of the sample fell into this category. “Occasional” users—between 10 and 59 times—and “fre quent users, nearly all had tried —each constituted 3 per cent of the sample. Among the fre quent users, nearly all had tired at least one other mood‐chang ing drug, and more than half had used as many as three other drugs. As expected, younger adoles cents were found to be less likely to use marijuana than older ones. Three per cent of 12‐ and 13‐year‐olds said they had tried it, compared to 28 per cent of 16‐ and 17‐year‐olds. Regionally, 11 per cent of Southern youngsters in the sam ple and 13 per cent of those in the North‐Central region said they had used marijuana. This compared with 20 per cent in the Northeast and 23 per cent in the West. The regional differences were even more striking among the older adolescents, the authors concluded. The report, prepared by Eric Josephson, Paul Haberman, Anne ‘Lanes and Jack Elinson, all of Columbia, cautioned that the survey findings do not dis close anything about trends in marijuana use and could not be compared to previous sur veys, most of which were based on school samples.

340-> General Denies Decision to Try Medina Was to Protect Army
FORT McPHERSON, Ga., June 22—The commanding general of the Third Army denied today that the decision to court martial Capt. Ernest L. Medina had been dictated by any de sire to protect the Army's pub lic relations image. His chief legal officer testi fied, however, that the impact of the Medina case on public opinion had been discussed by high officers but had not weighed in the decision to rec ommend that Captain Medina be brought to trial as the man responsible for the Mylai mas sacre. Liéut. Gen. Albert O. Connor, the Third Army commander, testified at a pretrial hearing that he was completely un aware of an alleged conspiracy to keep Captain Medina from testifying at the trial of First Lieut. William L. Calley Jr. Lieutenant Calley, convicted last March of ?? murder, had alleged that the Massacre in 1968 of South Viet namese civilians at Mylai re sulted from orders issued by Captain Medina. General Connor said that he had deliberately isolated him self from Mylai cases because of his role as the officer who had ordered the Medina court martial. He said that he knew nothing about the attempts of his chief legal officer, Col. Wilson Free man, to block Captain Medina's appearance at the Caney trial. The Calley prosecutor, Aubrey M. Daniel 3d, wanted to call Captain Medina as a Govern ment witness to rebut Lieuten ant Calley's contention that Captain Medina had ordeed the massacre. Colonel Freeman resisted, ar guing that it would be “incon sistent and unethical” for the Government to use Captain Medina as its witness against Lieutenant Calley and then turn around and attempt to prove that Captain Medina had lied. Colonel Freeman carried his fight to the Pentagon and Pre vailed over mr. Daniel. But Cap tain Medina was subsequently called as a witness by the Calley jury and denied that he had ever told Lieutenant Calley or his troops to kill unarmed civilans. From the witness stand, Gen eral Connor indicated that the Army had abandoned any plans to accuse Captain Medina of “ordering a massacre,” The specifications charge him with the responsibility for the premeditated murder of at least 102 civilians, and presumably the main burden of the Govern ment's case will be that he did nothing to halt the massacre by the men of his company and that he himself killed two persons. F. Lee Bailey, the defense lawyer, accused the Army of trying to undermine the credi bility of his client by announc ing the charges against Cap tain Medina, on the eve of the captain's testimony at the Cal ley trial. General Connor said that he had never been told of the at tempt by the defense to hold up the news release, which had been prepared before the gen eral signed the report of his legal staff recommending a court‐martial. Colonel Freeman denied that the timing of the release had been intended to injure Captain Medina. General Connor denied that Captain Medina was being court‐martialed “to satisfy the public.” “Certainly riot,” he said, nor was the court‐martial to be staged to “improve the public relations image” Colonel Freeman said that public opinion should not have any bearing on the decision to try Captain Medins, and it had not, although he and other offi cers had received many pleas to “be sure and look after” the men accused in the Mylal inci dent. Some of these he dismissed as “crank calls.”

341-> Foe Attacks Delta Village and Aid Force
SAIGON, South Vietnam, Wednesday, June 23 (AP)— Guerrilla forces swept through a village in the Mekong Delta early yesterday and then am bushed a Government relief force, reportedly inflicting heavy casualties. Reports from the field said the relief force lost 13 killed and seven wounded in trying to aid the village of Hieutu, 60 miles south‐southwest of Sai gon. South Vietnamese spokesmen said four militiamen were killed in the attack on the village, which began just before mid night Monday. Nine were re ported wounded and three missing. Casualties among the villagers were put at one killed and 15 wounded. In the northern part of South Vietnam, some of the South Vietnamese troops manning a besieged fire base called Fuller were reported to be continuing to conduct forays outside the outpost in an attempt to keep the enemy off balance. Officers at the base, just four miles from the demilitarized zone, said they intended to hold out at all costs. United States B‐52's were said to have struck three times in the area yesterday in a con tinued effort to disperse the North Vietnamese troops near the base. Officers said loss of the mountaintop position would open the way for the North Vietnamese to attack other bases guarding the southern edge of the buffer zone.

342-> A New Course: Adorning Jeans
Jann Johnson may soon be walking around with her autobiography decorating her from the waist down. Recently she began to paint, appliqué, embroider and stud a pair of jeans with symbols of “the story of my life so far.” She had already decorated some denim shorts with colored or metallic nailheads, each one implanted by hand. During working hours, the 24‐year‐old design school graduate is an assistant to Stan Herman of Mr. Mort —the Seventh Avenue fashion house. This evening, she will become an instructor. From 5:30 to 7, Gimbels is offering a short course in decorating jeans in its sixth floor auditorium, for which there is a fee of $2.50. Miss Johnson will share the podium with Linda Sampson, a 25‐year‐old costume designer, painter and writer for Rags, a fashion magazine. How She Started Miss Sampson, who has whipped up dresses for herself out of “$12‐worth of Polish babushkas” and motheaten fabric that she covered with stars, floated into jeansdecorating a while ago. “I've always been kind of patching things,” she said the other morning, as she walked around her apartment in a pair of jeans covered with print and felt appliques that had been shaped into trees, flowers, birds, rainbows and interstellar objects. The red‐haired Miss Sampson sees the vogue for decorating jeans and other articles of clothing as “a kind of joyous explosion.” Miss Johnson, who was wearing hand‐studded shorts and red tights, said, “I think it's a reaction to all the premade, prepackaged products. Decorating your body has always been a very primary thing, and jeans are an expression of this.” The interest, she said, is part of “a renaissance of handcrafts.” At this evening's demonstration, Miss Johnson will talk about the various techniques that can be utilized—painting with acrylics, affixing decals and “real objects,” putting on nailheads, trimming with Indian beading, appliquéing and embroidery. “I'll talk about how you make the most of basic stitches,” said Miss Johnson, “and how to take off from them and not be confined by the way it says in the book.” Less Exact Miss Sampson plans to be a little less exact. Slides will be shown of various jens she has decorated. She uses mostly appliqué techniques, with fabrics garnered from many sources: “Salvation Army draperies, scraps from costume designing (I used to do these Off‐Broadway shows with $2 budgets and sometimes we sprayed 59‐cents‐ayard Naugahyde with gold or silver—I use that), scraps from shops in Chinatown, from Polish shops, things from junk shops and stores with remnants from the 1930's, boxes of felt fishes and stars from an old sweater factory, things people give me who live aluminum and Plexiglas lives and don't know what to do with the things their grandmother left “I can't really teach people what's intuitive to me,” she said. “I'm not going to give a sewing class. But I'll explain where I get my ideas and how I start.”

343-> Summary of Major Provisions of Omnibus Welfare Bill Approved by the House
Authorizes a 5 per cent increase in Social Security benefits effective in June, 1972, that would increase the average monthly payment for individuals from about $133 to $141 and for couples from about $222 to $234, The in crease would go to about 27.4‐million people and cost $2.1‐billion for the first full year. Provides for an automatic increase in future benefits in any year in which the Con sumer Price Index rises 3 per cent or more. This escalator clause would also produce comparable increases in the payroll taxes and the wage base against which they were levied. Increases widows benefits to 100 per cent of the amount their deceased husbands would have received had they lived, providing 3.4‐million people with $764‐million more in benefits the first year. The change is effective in January, 1972. Establishes a special min imum benefit for people who have worked 15 years or more under Social Security. Beginning in January, 1972, some 300,000 beneficiaries would get increases costing $30‐million the first full year. Increases the amount of money a retired person may earn without losing benefits from $1,680 to $2,000 a year and permits a beneficiary to retain half of all earnings above $2,000, beginning in the 1972 tax year. The change would cost $484‐mil lion the first year, increase benefits for 700,000 people and provide benefits for 390, 000 more who are not now eligible. Reduces the waiting period for disability benefits from six to five Months, affecting 950,000 people et an annual cost of $105‐million.

Extends the Medicare pro gram to about 1.5‐million disabled people after they have been entitled to disabil ity benefits for two years, at a cost of $1.85‐billion for the first year. Requires Medicate benefi ciaries to pay one‐eighth of the cost of hospitalization from the 31st to the 60th day of their stay. Formerly the plan covered the full cost. Raises the yearly deduct ible feature of the Medicare medical insurance program from $50 to $60 effective next year. This would cost beneficiaries who enroll In this voluntary plan $70‐mil lion additional a year. Increases the premium for this medical insurance after July 1, 1972, to a level to be set by the‐Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. The monthly figure, now $5.30, is scheduled to rise to $5.60 in July. Makes a series of changes aimed at tightening the effi ciency and economy of the Medicare and Medicaid pro grams, including a limit of 5 per cent a year in increases in allowable nursing home costs. Establishes a $10,000 fine and a one‐year jail sentence for soliciting or accepting kickbacks or bribes in con nection with the Medicare and Medicaid, programs. Repeals the present pro grams of aid to the aged, blind and disabled and sub stitutes a new, completely federalized plan administered by the Social Security Ad ministration beginning July 1, 1972. Provides for phasing in the new Federal benefits over a three‐year period, with the income guarantee reaching $150 a month for individuals and $200 for couples begin ning in the 1973‐74 fiscal year.

344-> Boggs Tells House of Tap on Phone
WASHINGTON, April 22— Representative Hale Boggs, de fending his charge that the Federal Bureau of Investiga tion has been tapping the tele phones of members of Con gress, told the House today that the telephone line of his private home was tapped in 1970. In an hour‐long speech in which he said that the F.B.I. was engaged in a campaign of fear and intimidation against members of Congress, the House Democratic leader suggested that an electronic surveillance device had been used at the home of Senator Charles H. Percy, Republican of Illinois, and that a listening device had been placed in the office of for mer Senator Wayne Morse, an independent of Oregon. Mr. Boggs also said that an electronic listening device had been placed under the rug in the office of Senator Birch Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, during the fight over the ap pointment of Clement A. Haynsworth to the Supreme. Court. Such a report, winch had previously appeared in the press, had been attributed to staff aides of Senator Bayh. At no point, however, did Mr. Boggs directly accuse the F.B.I. of implanting surveillance devices, although that was the clear and intended implication of his remarks. As he completed his speech before nearly 100 members of the House, many of the Demo crats arose to applaud him. On the Republican side there was silence. But an immediate rebuttal came from Representative Clar ence J. Hogan, a Maryland Re publican who formerly worked for the F.B.I. As Mr. Boggs sat smiling, Mr. Hogan said that the majority leader had “failed completely” to offer any proof to substantiate his charges. “I am shocked and nauseated by the stench of red herring in this chamber,” Mr. Hogan said. The Boggs speech, he pro tested, was a “blatant admix ture” of “innuendoes,” “distor tions” and “nonsense” with “no proof positive” of earlier charges. For example, he said, Mr. Boggs offered no proof that his phone had been tapped or, even if so, that the F.B.I. had done the tapping. Later, Attorney General John N. Mitchell issued a statement in which he said, “Mr. Boggs failed completely and totally to substantiate his wild charges.” “He has not produced a modi cum of information to indicate that the F. B. I. has done any thing more than perform its duty to obtain criminal evi dence by lawful means,” Mr. Mitchell said. He added: “As I said when Mr. Boggs first made his slanderous state ments, the F. B. I. does not tap telephones of Congressmen and, Senators and has not done so in the past. It is unfortunate that Mr. Boggs continues to use the high office he holds to ma lign and defame the most re spected investigating agency in the world.” A spokesman for the Chesa peake & Potomac Telephone Company said that two repre sentatives of the company had checked Mr. Boggs's telephone last August at his request, but found no wiretapping or any evidence that there had been previous tapping. The spokesman, Fred Lang bein, also said that Mr. Boggs “appears to have a misunder standing of our policy.” “When we discover a wire tap, it is our practice to inform the customer and the appropri ate law enforcement authorities. There are no exceptions made for the F.B.I.” This information conflicts with a statement made by an other representative of the Chesapeake & Potomac, who told The New York Times re cently that the policy of the company was to tell the cus tomer if the line was being illegally tapped but not to tell the customer if the line was being tapped “legally.” Mr. Langbein also said that the phone company had pro vided the long‐distance phone records of Mr. Boggs to the Government but had done so, under subpoena. Mr. Boggs said that Senator Bayh, in the midst of the 19691 fight over the Haynsworth nomination, called In a private expert to search his office for electronic listening devices. The expert, according to Mr. Boggs, “located a radio trans mission emanating from be neath the carpet of the Sena tor's office.” It was several days, he con tinued, before the Senator's staff could get the necessary labor to raise the carpet and “when this was finally done, the device transmitting radio signals was gone.” He also said that Senator Morse was informed by a news man that there was a listening device in his office and that Senator Joseph M. Montoya of New Mexico, during his re election campaign last year, “had reason to believe that his telephone was under surveil lance.” In further support of his charge, Mr. Boggs recalled how Senator Percy recently related that a neighbor had discovered that a “highly sophisticated listening device,” capable of monitoring telephone calls from the Senator's home, was discovered underneath the chas sis of an automobile normally parked every night in front of the Senator's home.

345-> ‘Onegin’ Is Danced By Jan Stripling For Stuttgart Ballet
Cool toward innocent love and drawn toward destruction by his flawed conception of “honor,” Eugene Onegin is and was a subject for epic poetry. In more immediate terms as a character in the Stuttgart Ballet's production of the story, his inward and aloof reserve presents special difficulties for the interpreter. Wednesday eve ning at the Metropolitan Opera House, Jan Stripling danced an unbending Onegin, while Judith Reyn appeared as the spurned Tatiana and Richard Cragun as his friend Lensky for the first times this season. Mr. Stripling presented well the hardness of Onegin but lit tle of the mysterious allure that would explain his attrac tiveness to a young girl. It's a difficult problem, since Onegin is either shooting birds or his best friend, or being generally contemptuous of his surround ings. Miss Reyn's interpretation of the dreamy and initially drab Tatiana had a richer texture to it, modulating her yearning and inevitable disappointment. Her growth into a mature woman at the end was convincing. Mr. Cragun's Lensky is a bounding, impetuous young man, full of vitality and mer curial sentiments. Birgit Keil, dancing the flirtatious sister Olga also for the first time this season, played mischievously with his jealousy, bringing about his fatal duel with Onegin. She was an ingenue with an intelligently studied touch of callousness.

346-> Movie Mailbag
‘MYSTIFIED’ TO THE EDITOR: Hallelujah, Richard Corlissi His recent article on “Love Story” prompted me into the realization that I wasn't the only warm‐blooded human being who managed to emerge from both book and movie, maybe not tearless but very puzzled at its tre mendous buildup. His com ments on this phenomenal piece of exploitation and on Segal's ridiculous and pre sumptuous pomposity inter ested me, for I, too, am mys tified at its success. I must admit that “Love Story” did make me cry. But then again, a schmaltzy Joan Crawford movie, or a few bars of “Over the Rainbow” would have prompted the same maudlin response.

349-> MISS STACY GAINS GOLF FINAL AGAIN
PINEHURST, N. C., April 22 (AP) — An eagle 3 on the 14th hole sparked the late rally of Hollis Stacy, the defending champion, as she and a five‐ time winner, Barbara McIntire, scored semifinal victories to day in the North and South amateur golf tournament. Miss Stacy, a 17‐year‐old high school junior from Savan nah, Ga., gained a 2‐up deci sion over Beth Barry of Mo bile, Ala. Miss McIntire, a 36‐year‐old Colorado Springs, Colo., dress shop owner, led all the way in a 4‐and‐2 victory over Lancy Smith of Snyder, N. Y. Miss McIntire was one under par. The 18‐hole championship match will be tomorrow. No champion has repeated since Miss McIntire won in 1960 and 1961.

350-> WILTS RING PRICE PROVES TOO TALL
HOUSTON, April 22 (AP)— Negotiations for a July 26 heavyweight boxing bout at the Astrodome between Mu hammad All and Wilt Chamber lain, the pro basketball star, broke off today when Chamber lain demanded a tax‐free guar antee of $500,000. “We do not have a fight to announce at this time,” said Jack O'Connell, a vice presi dent of the Astrodome, at a news conference. Earlier, Ali had told news men: “This ain't no joke, we are going to fight.” But O'Connell arrived to an nounce that the fight was being blocked by Chamber lain's tax structure. The 7‐foot 2‐inch, 275‐pound Chamberlain (lid not appear at the Astro dome news conference. “A number of problems de veloped that could not be worked out in 30 minutes or an hour,” said O'Connell. Chamberlain is in a high taxi bracket as one of the best paid athletes in the world. “The hangup at the last minute resulted from Wilt's desire for a $500,000 tax‐free guarantee,” said O'Connell. “This raised more complications than we could figure out dur ing the time of this news con ference.” O'Connell said there was a “50‐50 chance” a fight could be worked out later. He also said the 34‐year‐old Chamberlain had signed an agreement last February that he would fight Ali, but that agreement was based on the assumption Ali would beat the heavyweight champion, Joe Frazier. Frazier won a unan mous decision last March. The 12‐round Ali‐Chamber lain fight, which would have have been promoted by Astro dome Championships Enter prises, Inc., drew criticism from many quarters. “This make a joke out of boxing,” said Bill Brennan, president of the World Boxing Association. “New York would not sanc tion a fight between All and Wilt Chamberlain,” said Ed win B. Dooley, chairman of the New York State Athletic Com mission. “I don't know if this makes a joke out of boxing or bas ketball,” said Harry Markson, who runs boxing for Madison Square Garden. Jack Kent Cooke, owner of the Los Angeles Lakers, for whom Chamberlain plays, said he opposed the bout becuase “Wilt may destroy or impair his unusual basketball skills to the detriment of his Laker teammates to Wilt, and, of course, to all basketball.”

353-> Nicklaus, Barber Lead Golf on 69's
RANCHO LA COSTA, Calif., April 22 —Jack Nicklaus and Miller Barber shared the lead at 69 today after the first round of the Tournament of Champions, but the course, with its high rough, proved too exacting for most players. The field consisted of 35 professionals who had won at least one tourney on the circuit dur ing the last 12 months. But over the La Costa Coun try Club course of 7,114 yards, with a rugged par of 72, there were 17 who finished with ag gregates of 76 or higher. An 80 by Deane Beman, who was eligible for winning the 1970 Milwaukee open, was highest. Tom Shaw, the winner of the Hawaiian and the Bing Crosby tourneys, took a 78. Gary Player of South Africa, said: “It's the best test of golf on the tour. You can't hit a ball 40 yards off line and make a birdie.” Player was in the runner‐up group a stroke back at 70 with George Knudson of Toronto and Frank Beard, last year's winner of this tourna ment. Beard, who like Player says courses in major events should be groomed and set up like this one, explained, “I would like to play a course like this every week if we could get Gary Player to stay away.” The reference was to Player's ad vocacy of course with high rough and his insistence that that is the way they are back at his home in South Africa. Nicklaus said the course was a “tough” one which “I wouldn't like to play as a steady diet. I have a tendency to slug more than I should.” Despite his 69, he drove into the rough at eight holes and was in the long grass that was ankle high off the fairways and higher in some spots. He had to hit from the tall grass three times at one hole. He said he drove into an area “a foot high” before getting a bogey 5 at the final hole. The purse is $165,000 and the co‐sponsors are “MONY,” (the Mutual Insurance Co. of New York) and the La Costa club. Arnold Palmer was at 71 with Dave Stockton and Bobby Nichols. When Palmer was told that Nicklaus thought the course was long, he joshed. “He's a short hitter,” said Palmer with a twinkle, “wait until he lengthens out a bit.” Knudson said he had an 80 in practice yesterday but that he got his 70 today—his best score of the year—because “I drove straight.” Only one tee shot of his fell into trouble. While Beard had four birdies in a row beginning at the 11th in his 36, 34–70, Nicklaus col lected three on the first four holes of the incoming nine. But he took three putts at the 15th and 16th greens. Then his shot into the rough at the home hole produced another bogey for an inward 35.

355-> Variety of Foods Can Often Result In Pet Malnutrition
“The nutritional needs of dogs, because of similarities in physiology and metabolism, are very much like those of man,” said Dr. Ben E. Sheffy yesterday at the Dog Fanciers Club luncheon at the Hotel McAlpin. Sheffy is professor of nutrition and assistant director of the Veterinary Virus Institute at Cornell. “Since man rarely has sufficient knowledge to feed himself correctly, the dog cannot be expected to fare better,” he said. News of Dogs Sheffy cited pet food as one of the fastest growing industries. With an infinite variety of foods being offered, almost to the point of consumer confusion, he warned the purchaser to be careful to select the most nutritious of these products. “Malnutrition, stemming not from deficiency but rather from excesses and imbalances is still observed,” said Sheffy. “Such malnutrition is imposed on the pet by well‐meaning masters, not only as a result of their lack of knowledge but often due to well‐intended expressions of kindness by overfeeding unbalanced supplemental foods.” He singled out supersupplementation and overnutrition as the chief causes of such problems. Discussing supersupplementation, the nutritionist said: “Because of the great variation in size, body conformation, hair coat activity and disposition of dogs, it is understandable that a food designed for ‘average’ performance of an ‘average’ dog under ‘average’ conditions may not be ideally suited for all stages of the life cycle. Thus some supplementation often may be in order.” “The most damaging deficiency in excessive supplementation with meat alone is that of calcium,” he said. “Other excesses, such as fat and protein, may be undesirable for older dogs, who are either obese or nephritic.” Questioned on what could be used as a safe and effective supplement, Sheffy suggested milk: which he called “an excellent supplement to provide high quality protein balanced with minerals and vitamins.” “In the last few months,” he said, “the major manufacturers of ‘all‐meat’ dog foods have fortified their products with minerals aid vitamins in compliance with the National Research Council's standards. This makes it possible to use these meat products in any proportions with dry foods.” On overnutrition with a puppy, Sheffy said: “It is recognized that in growth the sequence of development is the nervous system, skeleton, musculature and fat.” He warned that excessive feeding might upset this normal sequence.

356-> Hoffa May Not Seek Re‐election as Teamster Chief
DETROIT, April 21 — James R. Hoffa, the president of the Teamsters, has told top leaders in the union that he will not seek another term as president of the 2.1 million‐member union if court attempts fail to ob tain his release from jail soon. Hoffa made known his views on the presidency, which will be decided at a union conven tion on July 5, to at least two of the three teamster vice presi dents he met with during his recent furlough to see his sick wife, Josephine, in San Fran cisco. Several top teamster union leaders who wish to remain anonymous gave the account of what Hoffa said at the meet ings with Harold J. Gibbons, a teamster vice president in St. Louis and a former top aide to Hoffa, and Robert Holmes, a Detroit vice president of the union and a close friend of Hoffa. Hoffa also met with his hand picked successor, Frank E. Fitzsimmons, the acting pres ident of the union, but it is not known what they talked about. According to top sources in the union, Hoffa said that he was eager to get back and head the union if there was any prospect of his getting out of jail soon. This would depend on a cur rent appeal before Federal Judge Richard B. Austin, who imposed a five‐year sentence for pension fraud. The appeal asks that the five‐year sentence be served concurrently with his eight‐year sentence for jury tampering. If the Judge rules in Hoffa's favor, teamster leaders believe that he would then have good chance of soon being granted a parole. Hoffa was denied parole last March 31 but he can appeal the decision of the parole board within 90 days, about the time the teamster convention is scheduled to meet. But if Judge Austin rules against him and there is no chance for parole, Hoffa said that he would not run for re election. Instead, he urged the leaders who met with hiqt on the West Coast to bacld Mr. Fitzsimmons, who has been acting president since Hoffa hegan serving his sentence on March 7, 1967. One teamster leader para phrased Hoffa as saying: “I'm young in life. I'd love to come back. But if it would ham string the union and affect my family and hurt my chances of getting out then I won't stand in the way.” The union sources said that if court action gave Hoffa possibility of being out of jail within a year after the conven tion, then he would still run. But they indicated that he would not run for another five‐ year term as president if his next chance for release was at the next regular parole hear ing on June, 1972. Several teamster leaders also said that they had been urging Hoffa to concentrate “on get ting out of jail” and that being elected president while still in prison would only hurt his chances of being paroled. Mr. Gibbons said in an inter view that during the meeting he had urged Hoffa not to run for the presidency if there was no prospect of getting out of jail soon for the following reasons: ¶It would be an “affront to the American people” to elect a union president who would remain in jail and it would hurt the union's image. ¶It would increase his prob lems in getting paroled and build up support in Congress to have him removed as head of the union. ¶He would run into opposi tion from the 14‐man executive board of the teamsters and from delegates at the conven tion. The executive board of the union is scheduled to meet on May 10 at Miami Beach. Ac cording to union sources, the board is expected to endorse Mr. Fitzsimmons. If there is no change in Hoffa's status, a top union lead er said that a proposal would be made at the convention to elect Hoffa as president emeri tus of the union—an honorary position without salary or power. But if Hoffa had prospects of being released soon, an other teamster official said he would automatically be en dorsed by the union's executive board and be easily elected at the convention.

360-> Refugees Greet Hussein Warmly on Tour of Camp
ZIZIA, Jordan, June 22— Palestine refugees gave King Hussein of Jordan a tumultuous welcome today as he visited one of their camps for the first time since the civil war last September between his army and Palestinian commando forces. “Long Live King Hussein!” chanted more than 1,000 refu gees as the King visited the Zizia camp, a dusty complex of cottages, With troops stand ing guard on the roofs. Royal aides said the welcome showed that the Palestinian people supported the King and not the commandos, who were beaten in the September war. In a short speech, the King told the camp's residents that “all the unity and all the strength we can muster must be forged into a single striking force to regain Jerusalem.” Acknowledging the Palestin ians craving to regain their homeland, which is now under Israeli control, the King told them: “I promise you that I shall give my blood to achieve what you all want.” There were no incidents dur ing the King's visit in the camp for more than an hour. Aides said that the camp had formerly been a stronghold of the com mandos, or fedayeen. It had been used for storing arms and rockets belonging to As Saiqa, the Syrian‐backed commando group, they said. But the fedayeen pulled out during the September crisis, apparently because the camp's isolation makes it difficult to defend. All told, the camp has 7,000 refugees, but officials esti mated the crowd at 2,000 to 3,000, although many observers thought it was less. The offi cials said the absentees were Mostly either refugees who were away at work or women who were remaining modestly in their homes. The King's visit seemed ar ranged to show Arab public opinion that he enjoyed sup port from the Palestinians, who make up the majority of the 1.5 million subjects under his con trol on the east bank of the Jordan River. Answering a question, the King said he felt well and was in good spirits. Then he left the banquet room past the cheering throng. The director of the camp, Abdel Majid Azza, declared, “The spirit here is very good, We are pleased to see His Majesty.” Zizia is one of several camps erected to house refugees who fled eastward across the Jordan River after the 1967 Arab‐Is raeli war. Many of them had already been displaced as a re sult of the 1948 war.

361-> Crafts Council Starts a Drive For Funds to Expand Its Scope
The American Crafts Council, which operates the Museum of Contemporary Crafts here and, more broadly, is involved in aid ing craftsmen throughout the country opened this week a fund drive for $7‐million to en large its mission. A magnificent gift of a build ing at 44 West 53d Street—a four‐story structure across the street from the crafts museum at No. 29—started off the cam paign and the greater role en visaged by the council. The building was the gift of Mrs. Vanderbilt Webb, founder and chairman of the board of the council. At a luncheon Mon day honoring Mrs. Webb for her service, August Heckscher, administrator of Parks, Recrea tion and Cultural Affairs, sa luted “a very great citizen of New York.” National headquarters of the council, situated at 29 West 53rd Street since 1956, when the museum was opened, will be in the newly acquired build ing. Plans for further utilization include space for workshops, seminars, films, meetings and other educational activities. Donald W. Wyckoof, executive secretary, said there also would be a showcase shop “where the work of American craftmen will be seen to advantage.” “We will show work in concentra tion, not in volume,” he said. Previous grants have been re ceived from corporations and philanthropic institutions, but these have been for specific projects. The fund, which the council hopes to raise in the next five years—half of it by the end of 1972—is earmarked for development of programs and to generate funds for en dowment. The new building, which has an approximate value of $1‐ million, is the first step in the development program. Mr. Wyckoff said, “It is precisely because Mrs. Webb has done her work so well that the council must now seek broader funds through increased mem bership, corporate sponsorship and benefactions, in addition to trustee support.” Mr. Wyckoff said that the council acted as consultant to Federal agencies, to the Depart ment of the Interior, to muse ums. “Our major objective is to perpetuate and advance the crafts in this country,” he said.

362-> Letters
Amos Elon's article, “The Black Panthers of Israel” (Sept. 12), was very well done, and appeared at a most cru cial time in the annals of this story—in point of fact, the problem of the Sephardim in Israel is by no means a new phenomenon. The one rather important new element in this ongoing story, however, was surpris ingly omitted by Mr. Elon. I refer to the fact that two years ago, the Government of Israel, at a special meeting convened in Jerusalem and at tended by leading Israelis and invited guests from abroad, including the undersigned, de cided to accelerate the rise of Sephardic students in the uni versities of Israel by providing special scholarships. Accordingly, 2,000 Sephar dic students will be enrolled in pre‐university courses to enable them to enter Israel's schools of higher learning. Further, a nonprofit organiza tion was set up to expend $5‐million to speed the in crease in the number of Se phardic students in the univer sities. Twenty per cent of that sum will be raised from vol unteer gifts in the United States, and the balance has been earmarked from Israeli Government funds. Thus, there has been more progress to date than Mr. Elon mentioned in his otherwise ex cellent article.

363-> REVSON, HUME LEAD QUALIFIERS
MONTEREY, Calif., Oct. 16— Peter Revson and Denis Mime, who have comfortably domi nated this season's Can‐Am, qualified today for the first two starting positions in tomor row's running of the Monterey‐ Castrol Can‐Am. Revson won the polo position with a quail Eying record for the Laguna‐ Seca road course, 116.366 miles an hour. Tomorrow's race is the ninth of the 10‐race Canadian‐Atneri can Challenge Cup for Group 7 sports‐racing cars. Revson, who already has won four races in the $1‐million program, ran one of his qualifying laps around the 1.9‐mile Laguna Seca in 58.78 seconds. The previous record was 58.8, or 116.56 miles an hour, set last year by Vic Elford in Jim Hall's Chaparral 23. Hulme, Revson's New Zea lander teammate on the Gulf McLaren team, turned his fast est lap at 58.82, only four one hundredths of a second slower that Revson, for a speed of 116.287 miles an hour. Revson and Julme, first and second, respectively, in the sea son point standings drove a pair of bright orange McLaren M8F‐Chevrolets. Revson, a former New York er now living in California, won $2,600 of a special qualifying purse of $20,000 divided among the ten fastest qualifiers. Hulme's share was $2,350. Tomorrow's race will be run for a purse of $55,000 plus man ufacturers’ accessory awards. The field will consist of 32 sports‐racing cars, which have no limits on engine size. David Hobbs of Britain quali fied for third place in the T122 Chevrolet at 115.055 miles an hour. Jackie Stewart, who has won two of this year's Can ams, qualified for fourth in his Lola M L&M T260‐Chevrolet at 114.477 miles an hour. The next quickest qualifiers were: Jackie Oliver in the UOP Shadow, 113.058 miles an hour; Brian Redman, BRM, 112.630; Jo Siffert in a 5‐liter Porsche 917‐10, at 111.238; Lothar Motschenbacher, McLaren M8D, 111.057; Vic Elford, McLaren M8E, 109.686, and Bob Brown, McLaren M8E, 109.510. The Monterey‐Castrol Can am will run 171 miles, or 90 laps around Laguna Seca, road course built on 325, acres of land leased from Ford Ord, an Army training post, by the Sports Car Racing Association of Monterey Peninsula (SCRAMP). Proceeds help sup port local charities. Stewart's Lola‐Chevrolet, which has been plagued by handling problems all season, is sporting a “cow catcher” air foil, a configuration never be fore seen on Can‐Am cars. It is a wing of the size and shape normally mounted on the rear of a car to increase down force, but in this case it is in stalled in such a way that it protrudes from the front end. The “McLaren Catcher,” as it is also called, may be an aero dynamic help, but it is no thing of beauty. Vic Elford qualified in a car just purchased yesterday. On Thursday he had damaged his previous McLaren‐Chevrolet so badly that it could not be re paired for the race. So his team; American Racing Associates, simply purchased a year‐old McLaren M8E from Tony Dean of Britain. The team is owned by Roy Woods Jr.

364-> Anne Chamberlain Grives Piana Recital
Anne Chamberlain, a pianist with the technical tools Arid intellectual acuity necessary to Play 20th‐century music well, did not let her century down yesterday afternoon in her recital at Alice Tully Hall. Early (Debussy and Ravel), or late (Raoul Pleskow, Stefan Welpe and Howard Rovics), composers found in the tall, young artist a persuasive advocate. Three Debussy Préludes (Bruyères,” “La a Puerta del Vino,” and “Les Fées sont d'exquises danseuses”) were sensitively played, if without al remarkable range of tone color, Ravel's “Gespard” de la Nuit” went off in glittering style in “Ondine,” with good control and concentration in “Le Gibet, and sweepingly in that technical terror “Scarbo.” Miss Chamberlain Might have in jected more fantasy into the last, but she nonetheless gave the Ravel a gripping performance. Mr. Rovics's “Events” (1971), a first performance, presented, problems in its use of three different layers of tempos, but its brusque lunges, sudden contraits and disjunct lines sounded no personal tone, so that the schematic ingenuity left an academic taste. Mr. Pleskow's “Three Bagatelles” (1969) and “Piece for Piano” and Mr. Wolpe's “Study on Tritoni”, (1936) and “Presto Agitato” (1929) rounded out Miss Chamberlain's musically responsible and deftly played program. * James Cresce, the pianist who gave a recital at Carnegie Recital Hall late Saturday afternoon, has remarkable keyboard facility. In a program including Impromptus and Scherzos by Chopin, Etudes by Bortkiewicz and the pianist himself, Bach's “Italian” Concerto and three pieces by Falla, he rippled through everything as though it were the easiest thing on earth to do. If this is all there were to concertizing, he would be enormously successful, but there is more, much more, to it, and Mr. Cresce seemed to, have little interest in all the rest. He played almost everything faster than necessary or de. sirable and with approximately the same kind of tone and the same limited range of dynamics. Thus, the Bach work sounded much like Falla's “Ritual Fire Dance,” and both were scarcely distinguishable, in terms of performance, from Chopin, Bortwiewicz or Cresce. As a result, the hour‐long, intermissionless concert was more like an athletic event than a musical experience, and nobody, won.

365-> 60 Handcraftsmen Show Works at Bear Mountain
BEAR MOUNTAIN, N. Y., Nov. 7—An exhibition of the works of some 60 handcraftsmen from Rockland, Ulster and Orange Counties is on display at the Bear Mountain Inn here. A stopping place for decades during many a memorable jaunt to Bear Mountain State Park, the old inn wears an unaccustomed sprightly, modern air within its weathered stone and log mantle. Largely it's a young crowd exhibiting; about half are under 30. But they are not so young or so isolated on their one‐time farms or in rambling Victorian relics in slow‐paced towns to have failed to keep up with their city counterparts. Tendrils of a lush growth in crafts have been noted everywhere and, besides, many of the show's veterans and younger people are transplants from an urban scene. “They're thriving, esthetically, and they're also making a living,” said Mrs. Emily C. Stillman who, with Russell Wright of ceramic fame, is directing the craft exhibition and fair. The repertory of the hand‐crafted is seemingly endless. As Mrs. Stillman said: “Each of them does his thing.” And the “thing” comes out of a lump of clay, a ball of twine, a bit of metal, a length of fabric, a clump of hot glass, plastic, a log, a hide, paints and dyes, the junkyard and cellar odds and ends, sometimes with surprising results. Some do their thing in a single specialty; others' talents are multifaceted. Mrs. Stillman was the talent scout. She traveled 4,000 miles through the hills and valleys of the three counties to find the craftsmen, and she finally came up with too many for the show's envisaged size. The selected 60 or so are now tending shop in booths at the inn, and among these are craftsmen who were picked for special display in an adjoining gallery. In addition, the gospel of the handcrafted is being spread through demonstrations in weaving and spinning, jewelry and candle making, woodcarving, the art of pottery and of stitchery. Laurels have accrued through the years to such artist‐craftsmen as Maurice Heaton, specialist in glass; Karen Karnes, ceramist, and Paul E. Hultberg, designer of abstract enamels. They were far out in a younger day, so perhaps the stuffed landscapes and certain of the woven or braided forms that loom or flutter here and there in the show may soon be Old Masters. (A stuffed landscape is a flattish pillow covered with, purportedly, a landscape.) The exhibition‐fair, the first such event at the inn, is also the first to be sponsored by the Palisades. Interstate Park Commission. Nash Castro, the commission's general manager, said that the public use of the park “has been enhanced” by the show, which will remain through Sunday. Hours are 11 A.M. to 5;30 P.M. weekdays; 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M. on the weekend.

Wadkins shot a final round 71. Steve Melnyk of Jackson ville, Fla., finished at 430, 3 strokes ahead of Tom Watson of Kansas City. Allen Miller of Pensacola, Fla., was at 435; John Mahaffety of Houston, 436, and Bruce Fleischer of Miami, 438.

367-> Cynthia Potter, Finneran Score In A.A.U. Diving
WEST POINT, N. Y., March 31 — Tiny Cynthia Potter suc cessfully defended her title to night, but Jim Henry lost his to Mike Finneran, the Big Ten champion, as the Amateur Ath letic Union's national indoor diving championships began in the United States Military Academy's new pool. The 20‐year‐old Miss Porter, 5 feet 3/4 inch tall and 100 pounds, won the one‐meter springboard title for the third year in a row. The star of the Bloomington (Ind.) Gatorade team, coached by Hobie Bil lingsley of Indiana University, overcame a poor opening dive in the final to beat out Micki King, the Air Force captain and former Olympian. “After that dive I never thought could win,” said Miss Potter. Henry, now a graduate den tal student who has been ab sent from regular competition, gave up his three‐meter spring board title to 22‐year‐old Fin neran, an Ohio State diver who represented California's Santa Clara Swim Club. Henry disappointed and so did Klaus Dibiasi of Italy, the 1968 Olympic gold medalist in platform diving, who failed to qualify for the final. There were 75 divers, 34 of them women, competing at the meet, which continues tomor row and Saturday. The two top men and women will be the United States repre sentatives at the summer's Pan American Games in Colombia. The presence of Dibiasi was symbolic of what is happening in diving, a sport long domi nated on the international level by Americans. Despite hundreds of young divers developing in the successful A.A.U. age group programs, the United States being challenged for world leadership by Italy, the Soviet Union and East Germany. “What we need is a national team,” said Dick Smith, the Air Force Academy coach, and also proprietor of Dick Smith's Swim. Gym, a summer diving camp at Phoenix, Ariz. That way we would get the most out of our best divers.” At present, Smith contends, coaches like himself and Bill ingsley are free‐lancing with handful of divers in their stables. An Olympic or Pan‐Am team is pasted together every four years. “There's no coordination,” said Smith. “Coaches are out for their own people. If we had a national team with four or five regional coaches we could give our divers direction. “It's not that we are slip ping,” said Smith. “Other coun tries are catching up.” ??

368-> YANKEES BEATEN BY ASTROS, 9 TO 3
HOUSTON, March 31—The Yankees moved to the Astro dome tonight to continue spring training, but the new environ ment didn't help. Houston won the night exhibition, 9‐3. It was the Yankees' 19th loss in 27 games. Unearned runs were the un doing of Steve Kline, the Yankee starter. The young right hander had been one of Mana ger Ralph Houk's better per formers this spring. Tonight he was victimized by errors by Gene Michael and Curt Blefary and two passed balls by Thur man Munson. Three of the six runs scored off Kline were un earned. Bobby Murcer and Danny Cater had a pair of hits each for the Yankees. Cesar Cedeno led the assault on Kline, Gary Wes lewski and Lindy McDaniel with a triple and a pair of troubles. It was only Houston's second victory in six games this spring against American League East ern Division teams. The Astros are 13‐11 over‐all this spring.

370-> FOUR FARM BILLS SIGNED BY CAHILL
TRENTON, June 7 —Four measures aimed at improving the lot of migratory farm work ers in New Jersey were signed into law today, by Gov. Wil liam T. Cahill. The Governor described the new laws as a bill of rights for the estimated total of 20,000 farm workers, most of them blacks and Puerto Ricans, who follow the harvest into New Jersey every summer. Despite a series of reforms during recent years, some Fed eral officials and civil rights organizations contend that many migrants are still forced to live in squalid camps and work under deplorable condi tions in the fields. The four new laws, which were approved during the spring session of the Legisla ture, will require the following: 1—A guarantee that farm workers will receive the state minimum wage of $1.50 an hour even though they are working at piece rates in the field. This will force some farmers to implement piece rate pay primarily as an incentive for higher wages and production, rather than as a device to cut labor costs. 2—Migrant crew leaders, many of whom have been identi fied as key figures in the ex ploitation of farm workers, will be required to be certi fied by the state before they can recruit workers here. 3—The provision of $50,0001 to pay for a staff of Spanish ‐ speaking interpret ers to work with Puerto Ri can migrants, who now ac count for the vast majority of migrant workers in the state. 4—Farmers must provide pure drinking water and sanitary facilities in the fields. But this requirement does not become effective until Sept. 7, thus missing most of the growing season this year. With this in mind, Mrs. Irene Smith, the president of the New Jersey Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peo ple, was critical of the delay and asked, “Where are these workers going to get fresh water and decent sanitary fa cilities until then? You just watch, some crew leaders will be out there selling water for 10 cents a glass.” Mrs. Smith also contended that a state requirement that farmers must provide flush toilets in migrant camps was being ignored in many areas. Originally, the Governor had included in his package of mi grant bills a proposal that would have barred farmers from preventing qualified vis itors from entering into mi grant camps. However, the State Supreme Court made that proposal unnecessary when it ruled last month that farmers no longer could invoke the state's trespass law to stop visitors from gaining free ac cess into the camps.

371-> Wood, Field and Stream
Putnam County streams may have a surplus of ang lers today as the trout fish ing season opens in New York State. Two days ago, it was learned that no Westchester County streams had received their annual spring stockings of hatchery trout and many anglers who normally fish that county will probably continue north to Putnam. The Westchester fish were to have come from the state hatchery at Cold Spring Har bor, L. I., but a manpower shortage there made the stockings impossible, accord ing to a spokesman for the State Department of Environ mental Conservation. Two men instead of the usual four were available for the hatch ery's fish‐planting operations and hiring replacements for the two men, who left last winter, was blocked by an employment freeze in state agencies. Few holdover trout will be in the streams and reservoirs of the county, but they will be harder to catch than the less cautious hatchery wish. • E. V. White, superintendent of the Cold Spring Harbor Hatchery, said yesterday he hoped to begin stocking Westchester waters next Monday. About 6,000 brook trout, averaging over nine inches long, will be planted in two weeks. Long Island waters have been stocked and should pro duce some good fishing. In recent years, tidal streams have yielded good trout on opening day. Tidal streams stocked with brown trout fingerlings last fall include Crab Meadow Creek, Nisse quogue River, West Meadow Creek and Wading River on the North Shore, and Beaver dam Creek, Swan River, Tut hill Creek and the Connet quot River on the South Shore. Westchester County anglers willing to use a fly or a lure with a single hook could fish the restricted section of the Amawalk, where there is a year‐round population of brown trout and brook trout. The creel limit in this stretch is two fish 10 inches or more in length. • All of the early brook trout stocking has been completed in Putnam County waters, ac cording to A. J. Bonavist, a conservation biologist for the Department of Environmental Conservation. Fish have been planted in the East Branch of the Croton, Quaker Brook, Peekskill Hollow Brook and a tributary of it, Wiccopee Brook and Foundry Brook. Still Water Pond has been stocked, but is not open to fishing until later in the month. The Putnam County fish came from the DeBruce hatchery in the Catskills. A pleasant note for today's fishermen was sounded yes terday by the National Weather Service, which pre dicted the temperature would reach the 50's in many parts of the state. Last year on opening day the temperature was at or below freezing in most areas.

373-> Kahane Gets 5‐Year Suspended Sentence in Bomb Plot
Rabbi Meir Kahane received a five‐year suspended sen tence, was fined $5,000 and was placed on probation for five years here yesterday for plotting to make a bomb. The 39‐year‐old head of the Jewish Defense League ex pressed delight afterward at the outcome, saying he had ex pected to go to jail. Amid the cheers of 250 members and sympathizers, he promised that his group would remain mili tant. Shouts of approval broke the silence in the crowded room at the United States Courthouse in Brooklyn, when District Court Judge Jack B. Weinstein sentenced the rabbi and two other members of the league. The three could have received prison terms of up to five years each for conspiracy to manu facture explosives. They pleaded guilty to the charge on July 9 after a pre trial hearing on an indictment returned last May 13 accusing them of conspiring to transport stolen guns. In imposing sentence, Judge Weinstein cautioned the defend ants against violence. He warned that they must have nothing to do with guns, bombs, dynamite, gunpowder or any other weapons. And he declared that a breach of the peace would be considered a violation of probation. “In this country, at this time, it is not permissible to substi tute the bomb for the book as the symbol of Jewish man hood,” the judge said. “If the terms of probation are violated the suspension of the sentence will be revoked and jail for the full term imposed can result.” In an ebullient mood at a news conference afterward, Rabbi Kahane disavowed the court's injunction to eschew vi olende, saying: “Sometimes, there is no other way. I am not against the use of violence if necessary.” “Who determines that?” he was asked. “We do,” he responded. The rabbi's codefendants, Chaim Bieber, 41, of 225‐06 138th Avenue, Laurelton, and Stewart Cohen, 18, 161‐55 Jewel Avenue, Flushing, both in Queens, each received a three year suspended jail sentence and three years on probation. Bieber was fined $2,500 and Cohen $500. All had promised that they would surrender the league's cache of firearms and explosive materials. In pronouncing sen tence, the court criticized “those who have supplied the money” for their purchase. “They remain in the back ground but are partly responsi ble for this mischief by these defendants who at least had the courage to publicly plead guilty,” the judge said. “The court is not enjoining the defendants' free speech or peaceful picketing. They can say what they wish and praise or denounce as it pleases them. They may, by use of the phrase ‘never again’ and by lawful demonstration, keep the con science of the world alive to the horror of genocide in all its forms, past and present.” The court noted also that it had been informed that Rabbi Kahane wished to migrate to Israel with his family, adding that he was free to do so. The rabbi told newsmen he planned to go to Jerusalem late next month with his wife and two of his children. His two other children are already there with a brother. He reported plans to open a J.D.L. international center there. Saying that he planned to divide his time between New York and Jerusalem, the rabbi said he would maintain dual citizenship, as permitted under Israeli law. He contended that the pro bation restrictions imposed by the court applied to himself but were not binding on the J.D.L. And he outlined plans to pur chase .22‐caliber rifles “so as to provide rifle practice for Jews for self‐defense.” “Our campaign motto will be 'Every Jew a .22” he added. There is no obligation on his part to cooperate with the court, he said. “I didn't ask for mercy. I cannot compromise my principles with expediency. Some time or other, there is no other way than violence.” His lawyer, Barry I. Slotnick, said his client was not for bidden by the probationary terms to travel outside the United States. The league was founded in 1968 to protest the treatment of Jews in the Soviet Union and in the Arab states. Charges against the rabbi and his fol lowers grew out of allegations by the Government that they made explosives last August at the J.D.L. camp in Wood bourne, in Sullivan County, N. Y.

378-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: The proposal before the Senate For eign Relations Committee to limit Presidential war‐making powers has a laudable purpose, but this is one citizen alarmed at some of its possible consequences. For example, in placing a thirty‐day limit upon Presidential powers to wage war without their approval, are the Senators not in effect encouraging President to wage “quick wars”? In this circumstance, the temptation to use “quick weapons,” like the atom bomb, might become irresistible. The Senate already has the power to limit Presidential war‐making power. Let it set an effective date for the termination of appropriations.

379-> The Merry Month of May By James Jones. 361 pp. New York: Delacorte Press. $7.95.
James Jones writes abominably, like Dreiser, which is to say that his sentences are dismal monstrosities of kitsch, while his novels (some of them, anyway) render the world with great power. Jones is a typical prod uct of a culture that finds it so easy to sneer at the mandarin finesse of Henry James and believes in its heart of hearts that the only art worth cleaving to at all is rough hewn, untutored, and springs not from emotion remembered in tran quility — where in the true American life is that?—but from action remembered in the midst of still more action. In short, art becomes journalism, the writing that gets done with the guns still pounding outside: Stephen Crane, Hemingway . . . and James Jones at his best. Without, so far as I know, having actually worked for a newspaper, Jones is a good reporter‐novelist, or has been when he's tried it. Pearl Harbor was the war story to end all war stories, and Jones covered it brilliantly in “From Here to Eternity.” Norman Mailer, still at Harvard, was plotting the best way to write the novel of the war, but his Aquarian temperament and heavier cultural baggage led him away from “the story” in “The Naked‐ and the Dead,” just as they have led him away from the news in his more re cent, officially reportorial books into a thicket of dread, haunting voices and Dionysiac odors. Mailer writes “think pieces”; Jones is the man for a good action lead. And in May, 1968, for the second time in his career, Jones found himself smack dab in the middle of a banner head line in the making. How much luck can a newsman have? First, Pearl Harbor; then the second French Revo lution. But Jones had a lot more going‐ for him than an apartment‐ in Paris on the Ile St. Louis, and in this new book he's put together the best account in English of the May Days—and also put Paris on paper as knowingly as any Anglo‐Saxon has ever done. No matter that the narrator, Jon athan James Hartley III, the editor of an expatriate American review, is a dud of a character or that the ostensible plot revolving around the decline and fall of Hartley's neigh bors on the Ile, the Harry Gallaghers, is the stuff of which Redbook articles are made, with exotic spice added. The Gallaghers are all feasible ex amples of modern‐day Paris expatri ates—normal middle‐class Americans plus or minus a chromosome, as it were, a touch out of joint with America and not quite at home in France. Jones, on the other hand, is more at home on the Ile than most peo ple ever get anywhere, as I can testify, having accompanied him, during a couple of interviews in 1967, to his favorite local restaurants and having visited his menage and watched him interact ebulliently and astutely with the French. These happy scenes—the Ile's gutsy Alsacian brasserie where Jones/Hart ley is a regular whom the staff greet with whoops of pleasure, Chez Rene, the Brasserie Lipp—are all in the novel, not only as local color but also to show how Left Bank Parisian restaurants made it through the general strike. Jones is also master of the back streets and history of the Quartier Latin, which has a point here too. Each time Hartley penetrates the rioting, he outflanks the worst of the tear gas by simply following a special route around the fray. Once he gets caught between the police and stu dents, for a terrifying still mo ment when one false twitch is enough to touch off a charge. He gets inside the Odeon, ob serves the student occupation force with guarded sympathy, and even plays a small part in the activities of their film com mittee, Always the reporter, he keeps careful tabs on political events, the public mood, changes in riot techniques and strategies, and even stops to describe ex actly how a barricade of paving stones is built and how it is painstakingly reassembled into pavement. It is nuggets like these that accumulate into a very real texture, far more real than the people Jones sticks into it, even though they are, at least in some cases drawn from life. Mary McCarthy, for example, appears briefly under a trans parent pseudonym. But the ma jor characters, whether they re semble real expatriates or not, are a bit too “on the nose,” too instantly filmable. The best of them, the Gallaghers' revolu tionary son Hill, turns on his liberal (actually ex‐radical) par; ents and says: “Boozers! Lush heads! Getting fat in the belly and fat in the mind! With your old Louis Treize and your ritzy apartment! You're proud of me? After what your generation did to the world?” The exclamation points fly and Hill's credibility flies apart with them. But Jones fries other sorts of fish far better. Here he is cali brating the mood of his city just before the turning point of the revolution: “The feeling in the air was one of sullen patience, instead of enthusiasm. When is it going to stop? the faces seemed to say. You had the feeling that anything now, any act, might . . . set off the final explosion of civil war. “Probably the increasing gar bage in the streets, the crates, the cartons, the rotting food, contributed a lot to the feeling. The Army had sent out troops in trucks to try and do, some thing about the garbage. At first the striking garbage workers had tried to fight with them and stop them. Now the soldiers went under armed guard. But they could only make a dent in the accumulating trash.” Two days later, the General made his speech, the tide turned and James Jones began “the trying to put it down” on paper. The result is definitely Pulitzer Prize material—for one of the journalism prizes, that is. ■

380-> Lion Country By Frederick Buechner. 247 pp. New York: Atheneum. $5.95.
Africa, for the New Yorker, be gins at East Orange. Once he has reached the loblolly latitudes of Dix ie where Habakkuk and real‐estate prices are quoted with the same pitched whine, the New Yorker is, like the protagonist of Frederick Buechner's sixth novel, among Tua regs and Tshiluba. He is a subway rider in lion country. Antonio Parr, a spiritually exhausted 34‐year‐old prep‐school teacher and would‐be novelist, hopes to recoup his position as a writer by publish ing an exposé of a divinity diploma mill, the Church of Holy Love, Inc., of Armadillo, Fla., run by the Rev. Leo Bebb and his assistant, Laverne Brown, whom Bebb has resurrected from the dead The Church of Holy Love will ordain any male over 18, for a fee, reasoning that there's di vinity in us all. To Parr, this vulgar racket deserves a feature article. So off he goes to Florida, to collide with the resurrected Brown, the prof iteering Bebb, Bebb's delicious daughter Sharon, Bebb's drunken Wife and “The Apocryphal New Tes tament,” published by the Oxford University Press and edited by M. R. James, which Parr borrows for bedtime reading from Bebb's eclectic library. Montague Rhodes James (1862 1936), the Cambridge medievalist and ghost‐story writer, gives the unplot ted anecdote of this speculative nov el its storm‐center and its window into tradition, without which it would be merely an encounter between a sophisticated skeptic and a hot gos peler for whom grace is a quick dol lar. James's “Apocrypha” is a col lection of those Gnostic and trumped up gospels where Jesus turns his playmates into goats and performs other unseemly tricks. It also con tains a Harrowing of Hell, and this catches Parr's eye. In a wonderful passage of brilliant fantasy, Buechner re‐creates this mythical scene as it were Italian opera, the way Parr's imagination chooses to see it. An Er rol Flynn Christ, bellowing Verdi, disarms Satan and Death, and makes off with Adam and the patriarchs. It is only a step from this delight in the rejected, naive gospels to un derstanding that Bebb and his gau dy, traditionless version of Christi anity might be more than it appears to the Pharisee's nose. Bebb is not afraid to get out of his car and move among the lions in the zoolog ical park. He has raised Brown (elec trocuted by a hot wire in Nashville) from the dead. And he is about to convert a copious family of rich Tex as Indians to the Church of Holy Love, Inc. As the promise of the church in this mass conversion is to restore the potency of its elder, a polygamous old pagan, the baptism involves indecent exposure and enough scandal to send Bebb west with his new parishioners. Parr's sen sual delight in the world has been restored by Bebh's daughter Sharon, who becomes Mrs. Parr. There is more to the novel than this (the death of Parr's sister, for instance, of a rare and wasting dis ease; a cat named Tom, who is—sym bolically—caged at the vet's through out the novel), but essentially the book is almost embarrassingly a gen teel comedy, beautifully written and told with the mastery of a crafts man. When we notice that the novel begins on the subway stairs, with several pointed references to Orphe us (who descended into Hell to re claim his dead wife), that it has a Harrowing of Hell at its center, that men among lions has a decided Chris tian ring to it, and that the author is a Presbyterian minister, we real ize that we are reading a parable. On one level we are being told about the reassessment of goals and values which joggles the elbow of every 40 year‐old. On another, we are being reminded that the spirit of Christian ity is more a matter of energy and awareness than of forms and rites. That Saint Paul said that the day of the Lord would come like a thief in the night has become a comfortable, poetic thought that Christianity has to keep translating into such outra geous terms as Mr. Buechner con templates: that Christ will come as a Florida real estate booster in a loud shirt. Insofar as this novel makes mean ing arise from tacky and worldly matters, it is awfully good to read, but even when we are in full appre ciation of the brisk and lively way in which the story is told, there re mains the curious fact that the pro tagonist is not a protagonist at all. He tells the story, makes love to his wife‐to‐be, and learns a thing or two. He encounters no conflicts, has no adventures; in short, participates in none of the energy that flows through the novel. One wonders, after all, if he benefitted from being in lion coun try, or whether he merely looked at it and told us about it. ■

382-> 10 in Black Caucus Visit Bases in Study Of Charges of Bias
Ten members of the Congressional Black Caucus visited 10 military bases across the country yesterday, looking into charges of racial. discriminaton in the armed forces. Their one‐day trips to Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine bases are scheduled, to be followed today by a three‐day hearing in Washington into alleged racism within the military. Each of the 13 members of the caucus is a Democrat. Representative Louis. Stokes, of Ohio, brother of the outgoing Mayor of Cleveland, Carl Stokes, has said that his own investigation of conditions at the vast Fort Hood Army base in Texas would also include the nearby town of Killeen. Mr. Stokes said he had been “bombarded with letters from servicemen from all over the world, especially black and other minority servicemen,” complaining of discrimination, and that the sprawling Texas facility was “one of the worst places we've heard from domestically.” Representative Shirley Chisholm of Brooklyn, who visited Fort Dix, N. J., said that a main area of inquiry would be the “lily‐white justice” that she said failed to protect the rights of black servicemen. And a Negro Congressman from Berkley, Calif., Ronald V. Dellums, said they would also look into the “disproportionate number of black G.I.'s confined in military prisons.” Mr. Dellums visited Travis Air Force Base in California yesterday. Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem visited the Fort Bragg Army base in North Carolina; Representative Parren J. Mitchell of Baltimore went to Fort Meade Army base in Maryland, and Representative Charles C. Diggs of Detroit, the caucus chairman, investigated conditions at Westover Air Force Base in Massachusetts. Representative John Conyers Jr. of Detroit went to Fort Campbell in Kentucky, and the two Negro Congressmen from Chicago, George W. Collins and Ralph H. Metcalfe, visited the Great Lakes Naval Base in Illinois. Charles Knox, the administrative assistant to Representative Augustus F. Hawkins of Los Angeles, was at the marine base at Camp Pendleton, Calif., and Walter E. Fauntroy, the first nonvoting Congressional delegate from Washington, D. C., went to the Quantico marine base in Virginia.

383-> Jason Robards Takes His First Role in a Musical
Jason Robards, who has distingished himself as a stage and film actor for more than a decade, will play his first Broadway musical role this season. The husky‐voiced performer will appear as Junius Brutus Booth in “Booth Is Back in Town,” by Austin Pendleton, an actor who will be making his debut as a playwright. The lyrics are by Gretchen Cryer, and the music is by Arthur Rubinstein. The show deals with the stormy career of Junius Brutus Booth, the AngloAmerican actor who was the father of both the illustrious Edwin Booth and John Wilkes Booth, who mortally wounded President Lincoln. William Daniels, who created the role of John Adams in “1776” on Broadway and is now repeating the part in the film version, will direct. The New York premiere is scheduled for late March, with rehearsals starting Jan. 24. Richard Fields, former music publisher, is producer of the show, capitalized at $500,000. Asked yesterday about the quality of Mr. Robards's singing voice, Mr. Fields replied: “He sings like a bird, he's very musical and plays a five‐string banjo. At the moment,” he added, “Mr. Robards has six songs.” Musical of 4 Generations “Different Times,” a musical dealing with four generations of an affluent Boston family, has been earmarked for a Broadway opening on Jan. 10 at a theater to be announced. It has book, music and lyrics by Michael Brown, whose stage credits include songs for “New Faces of 1952” and “House of Flowers.” The $225,000 musical venture is being produced by Bowman Productions, Inc., headed by Arthur C. Twitchell, in association with William L. Witt. The show will have a cast of 12 players, all receiving equal billing. Radio Corporation of America will record the original cast album. Mr. Brown also will direct. Play About Town in South “Memphis Store Bought Teeth,” a nine‐character play with music about people and life in a Southern town, will open at the Orpheum Theater in mid‐December under the production auspices of D. Brian Wallach. The new offering has a book by E. Donald Alldredge, an original score by William Fisher and lyrics by David Brian. It is based on a short story by Mr. Alldredge, for mer head of the Theater Arts Department at Virginia Tech and editor of The Salem Press. Mr. Fisher, a member of the board of directors of the Metropolitan Opera, has composed a variety of music, including an opera based on Oscar Wilde's “The Happy Prince.” Mr. Brian, who appeared in “Ari,” is making his off‐Broadway debut as a lyricist. ‘JFK’ to Open Nov. 23 “JFK,” the one‐man show starring Jeremiah Collins, will open at the Circle in the Square Theater. on Nov. 21 instead of Nov. 23. Opening night curtain will be at 7 P.M., thereafter at 7:30. David F. Segal will design the production, which focuses on the public years of the late President Kennedy. Walt DeFaria is the producer.

384-> McGraw Backs Survey After Chase Unit Critique
Chase Econometric Associates, an economic consulting arm of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, questioned yesterday the accuracy of the McGraw‐Hill capital‐spending survey, which is widely followed as an indicator of future business plans to acquire new plant and equipment. In a memorandum to his clients, Michael K. Evans, president of Chase Econometrics, said that “with respect to the 1971 McGraw‐Hill anticipations, I think it is quite likely that fixed business investment will increase 11 per cent rather than the 7 per cent indicated by their survey.” In reply, Douglas Greenwald, chief economist for the McGraw‐Hill Publications Company, who is responsible for the spending survey, said that his capital‐spending figure covering all industries had an average error of only 4.8 per cent over the last 14 years and only 1.8 per cent in the last five years. Furthermore, Mr. Greenwald said, the survey never pretended to be a forecast, but rather was simply a report of business plans at a given moment in time. Mr. Evans, who is one of the leading exponents of the use of large‐scale mathematical models to study the economy, analyzed past McGraw‐Hill survey results in relation both to actual capital spending and as to the survey conducted jointly by the Commerce Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. He also constructed what he termed a “naive model” of capital spending, which simply assumed that spending in any given year would rise by the same percentage as the previous year. “The McGraw‐Hill anticipations have a standard error,” he asserted, “which on the average is 89 per cent of the error which would occur by using a naive model which says only that investment will grow at the same rate next year as it did this year.” Such a naive model, Mr. Evans said, was “obviously a very poor method of forecasting, and should serve as an upper bound for errors which would occur by using the anticipations series for prediction.” By contrast, the memorandum continued, the Commerce Department‐S. E. C. capitalspending survey had an average error that was 55 per cent of the naive model error. “Furthermore,” Mr. Evans stated, “the McGraw‐Hill surveys predict the direction of change at turning points [when there is a change in the direction of the spending trend] correctly only 58 per cent of the time, and 44 per cent of the time for durable manufacturing; the comparable figures for the [Commerce‐S.E.C.] figures are 60 per cent and 67 per cent respectively.” “The advantage of the McGraw‐Hill survey over the [Commerce‐S.E.C.] survey is clearly that it appears four months earlier [November against February]. This must be balanced against its much greater error. Each client will undoubtedly decide for himself whether the additional wait is worthwhile, or whether it will be more useful in the future to use econometric methods to predict investment,” Mr. Evans said. He stated that, looked at industry by industry, “the McGraw‐Hill series has a larger standard error than the naive model in seven out of 20 industries, and has an error which is at least 75 per cent as large as the naive model error in another six industries.” In further rebuttal to Mr. Evans, Mr. Greenwald of McGraw‐Hill stated that the “allindustry” figure produced in his capital‐spending survey—even though it was not designed as a forecasting tool—had a very good record as a predictor. In the manufacturing area, he said, the average error of the McGraw‐Hill survey was 5.7 per cent over the last 14 years during which the survey has been made and 5.8 per cent in the last five years. The McGraw‐Hill survey—to which Chase Manhattan is subscriber—“provides an awful lot of detail for $5,” Mr. Greenwald observed. The Chase Econometric service was a lot more expensive, he added, “and I wouldn't buy it, anyway.”

385-> Soprano and Mezzo Share Debut Program
Helen Chen Lee, a Chinese soprano recently arrived in New York, and Rosemary Leeder, a Canadian mezzo who has lived here since 1962, shared a debut program at Carnegie Recital Hall yesterday afternoon, Both women have strong, basically appealing voices and a feeling for the dramatic content of their material; neither has com pletely solved the technical problems that restrict their present level of accomplish ment. At this point, Miss Lee is closer to the goal. She projects forcefully and has good dy namic control, and her vocal agility in the mid‐and upper range allowed her to achieve attractive effects in such essen tially lyric pieces as an aria from “The Bartered Bride” and a perfectly beguiling group of Chinese songs. Her lower register is insecure, however, and she could summon neither the power to sustain the chest tones of Boito's “L'altra Notte in Fondo al Mare” nor the inten sity needed for Schumann's “Die Lotosbiume.” Miss Leeder, more confident interpretively, better able to convey the subtle emotional gradations of Strauss' “Befreit” and Ravel's “Shéhérazade,” could rarely free herself from a vocal quaver that led to unclear tone production, and sometimes even obscured the pitch. An artist of considerable potential, Miss Leeder has yet to reach the point where her technique and musicality are in tandem. Marshall Williamson pro vided the assertive, yet sensi tive, accompaniments.

386-> SAIGON SPEEDS AID TO TYPHOON VICTIMS
SAIGON, South Vietnam, Tuesday, Oct. 26 (AP) — South Vietnam's Government took steps yesterday to aid victims of Typhoon Hester as officials reported 103 persons dead or missing and described the dam age as catastrophic. President Nguyen Van Thieu, meeting in emergency session with his Cabinet, ordered $725,000 made available for disaster relief in the country's five northern provinces. Earlier in the day, Premier Tran Thien Khiem toured the affected areas and made on‐ the‐spot grants of $19,000 to each province and $3,500 to the city of Danang. Mr. Khiem also promised each province 50,000 sheets of tin roofing. The casualty toll included at least 85 South Vietnamese dead, 15 missing and 100 known in jured. Thirty‐three of the dead were aboard a South Vietnam ese Air Force transport that crashed near Quinhon. Else where, three American soldiers were known to have been killed and 21 to have been injured. America bases at Chulai, Da nang and Camp Eagle suffered heavy damage. The Chulai base, headquarters of the Americal Division, was hardest hit, with 75 per cent of its structures damaged. The 91st Evacuation Hospital there was forced to suspend operations and trans fer its patients.

387-> Only Viewers of U.H.F. Saw Drama ‘Live’ Here
In the N.Y. metropolitan area only viewers of Chan nel 31 on ultra‐high‐frequency television sets were able to watch the United Nations proceedings live. Of the three networks, ac cording to their own accounts, the National Broadcasting Company informed its nation wide viewers first of the American defeat on the “im portant question” vote. NBC interrupted a movie at 9:30 P.M. for a minute's report by its United Nations corre spondent, Pauline Frederick. A bulletin followed 17 min utes later and the start of the Tonight Show, normally 11:30, was delayed for a summation. The American Broadcast ing Company, which had been transmitting the Min nesota Vikings‐Baltimore Colts football game, used a time‐out period at 9:52 for a minute's live report by its United Nations correspond ent, John MacVane, on the “important question” vote. A second, two‐minute bulle tin at 11:20 on passage of the Albanian resolution came as a punt was being made. The Columbia Broadcasting System had a special live report during its regular lo cal news show at 11:02 P.M. The network transmited at the same time a “feed,” al lowing affiliates around the Country to use the local re port or not. The nationwide Merv Griffin show later was interrupted for a summary report.

388-> Theater: ‘On the Town,’ Bernstein's 1944 Musical
The Bronx is still up, and the Battery is down—as they still sing—but Leonard Bern stein's 1944 musical “On the “Town” is just about in the middle. As revival opened last night at the Imperial Theater, and while some of the glory has doubtless de parted, there were moments of brightness if not incan descene. Perhaps—could it be?—New York has changed. Certainly music has. ON THE TOWN, a revival of the musical. Book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green; music by Leonard Bern stein; based on an Idea by Jerome Robbins; coslumes by Ray Aghayan and Bob Mackie; setting by James ?? tipo; lighting by Tharon Musser; music direction by Milton Rosenstock; orches trations by Leonard Bernstein and Her shy Kay; assistant choreographer, Mi chael Shan; musical coordinator, Doro thea Freitag; production stage manager, Terence Little; makeup and hair styles by Ted Azar; directed and choreo graphed by Ron Field. Presented by Jerry Schlossberg‐Vista Productions; Rick Mandell and Allen Lilke, associate producers. Al the Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street. ?? The musical was inspired by Jerome Robbins's great ballet “Fancy Free,” which also had music by Mr. Bern stein. But while the ballet endures, the musical now has only a fitful life. Mr. Robbins it seems, has had the last laugh as well as the first. The story is of three sail ors on 24 hours' shore leave in New York City—the city at war, when Times Square was Times Square, the Camel still puffed and all the men looked like either soldiers, sailors or double‐breasted gangsters and all the women wore platform shoes and either flowerpots or halos on their heads. There were crooners in nightclubs—to say nothing of Carmen Mir anda complete with bananas —and zoot suits and big bands, and Coney Island was Coney Island and subways were not for mugging. • Three sailors—Chip, Ozzie and Gabey. On a subway. They see an advertisement for “Miss Turnstiles,” a cer tain Ivy Smith, and Gabey falls madly in love with this paragon of the mass transit. who apparently can sing, dance, socialize and put shot. The three of them decide to search New York for her — and, guess what? Gabey finds her. And so Chip finds Hildy, a Checker cab‐driver who can cook like Escoffier and is never off duty, and Ozzie finds Claire (Delune, of course) who is an anthropol ogist specializing in man. That was wartime for you! The story is less than tense. Yet the book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green have ease and a de cent few laughs. The music by Mr. Bernstein has worn less well, even in the updated orchestrations by Mr. Bern stein himself and the splen did Hershy Kay. “New York, New York is a Helluva' Town” is still a helluva' num ber, but too many of the nostalgic ballads sound like sub‐Puccini filtered through Glenn Miller, and there is terrifyingly explosive busy ness to much of the music. It moves in fits and starts and often with more fits than starts. It is, I think, a good idea occasionally to revive old musicals to see how they stand up, and Ron Field, who has directed and choreo graphed this production, has done so with skillful rever ence for the original. It looks like a forties show, but not ludicrously so. Mr. Field has staged the musical numbers with zest and imagination, but, with re spect, he is no great shakes as a choreographer. The mu sical calls for a number of set ballets—these were fash ionable in musicals of the day—and Mr. Field is no Jerome Robbins. His ideas would have been old‐fash ioned in 1905, let alone 1944. The scenery by James Trit tipo had the right early Oliver‐Smith look to it and a pleasing ingenuity that had style and finesse, The spang ly fantasy Coney Island of the mind was fun, and the bustling picture of Times Square — complete with a Nedicks that checked fur wraps — had time‐traveling authenticity to it. And the costumes by Ray Aghayan and Bob Mackie were most virtuously hideous. Were girls dressed like that ever con sidered viewable, let alone datable or lovable? Nothing changes like fashion. Where Mr. Field is most successful is in the perform ances of his six principals, and the women are markedly better than the men. Best of all is Bernadette Peters as the Bronxly nasal taxi driver, who wants to go to her place and has a heart as big as the Stage Door Canteen. Miss Peters sings, acts and dances, in that order, wit ha saucer eyed naughtiness and wide vowelled drawl that is totally enchanting. • Phyllis Newman as Claire, the predatory Margaret Mead, also danced and sang with just the right style and gusto. Donna McKechnie made a sweet and talented Ivy Smith, and the sailors on the town were the energetic and vocal ly engaging Ron Husmann, Remak Ramsay and Jess Rich ards. The score was authori tatively conducted by Milton Rosenstock. • This handsome and lavish resuscitation of “On the Town” is going to please those who remember its past rather than those who look to its future. The musical has not the dimensions of a clas sic—it is no Johann Strauss, Offenbach, Gilbert and Sulli van or even Jerome Kern. It does, however, help pinpoint a period. Like a Late Late Show movie of uncertain vin tage, the bloom may be off, the quality of the time evap orated. Yet it may serve to remind people of wartime in nocence—when New York was a visitor's paradise and ironically peaceful. And the music—for all its occasional shades of Aaron Copland lyricism—does have a brash and Broadway bounce to it. There is a con fidence to “On the Town” that few musicals can muster nowadays. Unfortunately, for too much of the time the confidence seems misplaced.

389-> Aid Drive Begun for Burned Lab Used for ‘A rrowsmith’ Research
Efforts to restore a tradi tion‐laden medical laboratory in Brooklyn that was badly dam aged by a recent fire have be gun modestly with a collection of $300. It will take a great deal more than that to bring the 83‐year‐ old Hoagland Laboratory of the Long Island College Hospital back to even an approximation of what it was when Sinclair Lewis used it in researching his novel “Arrowsmith.” But Gabriel Bakesy, the med idcal‐research librarian, is hope ful that the funds can be ob tained and that the structural damage, at least, can be re paired on the Hoagland, which is believed to have been the first bacteriological laboratory in the United States. An irreplaceable loss, how ever, is the collection of papers, books and records that were destroyed by the fire. “We had books dating back to 1652 and over 300 journals from over a century ago,” said Mr. Bakesy. “The damage is inestimable.” The most immediate incon venience was suffered by the staff and students of the four faculties who used the build ing on Pacific and Henry Streets, in their studies. They are the schools of nursing, ra diology, practical nursing and nurses aides. Miss Helen Farrell, associate director of the School of Nurs ing, said that academic records were able to be saved because they were stored in fireproof steel cabinets, “but we lost all our nursing journals and re search books.” Despite the loss, she said, “our staff has kept everything going smoothly and students' morale is high.” The day after the fire on April 18 all the nursing school classes were running on a more or less reg ular schedule in improvised classrooms at the adjacent nurses' residence. In the radiology division, the fire proved a great inconven ience. “Many items of demonstra tion and equipment were de stroyed,” explained Dr. Law rence Walker, an instructor. “This will be particularly hard on the seniors who have finals coming up in June.” The Hoagland building, until 1955, served the Long Island College of Medicine, which has since become the Downstate Medical College of the State University of New York. The medical library lost in the fire operated in affiliation with the Downstate Medical Center and was supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health. The idea for the bacterio logical laboratory was origin ally proposed in 1884 by Dr. Cornelius N. Hoagland after his grandchild had died of diph theria. Dr. Hoagland wanted to know more about the nature of the disease bacteria and he sought out the findings of fa mous bacteriologists such as Pasteur and Loeffler. Dr. Hoagland was persuaded to endow a laboratory by Dr. Joseph H. Raymond, a faculty member at the Long Island Col lege Hospital. Dr. and Mrs. Hoagland donated the land and the building, and the first lec ture was given there on Sept. 26, 1888.

390-> JUSTICES ALLOW RULING BY POSTEL
The Appellate Division refused by a 4‐to‐1 vote yesterday to order State Supreme Court Justice George Postel to reopen the extortion trial of Carmine J. Persico to the public. It by‐passed the question whether Justice Postel had acted properly in excluding the press and the public from the Persico trial, ruling only that the newsmen who had asked that it be reopened had no right of their own to insist it be public. The right to an open trial,, the majority said, is one that belongs essentially to the defendant, and, as the court noted, Justice Postel had excluded the public at the request of Persico. The defense had made its request because, it said, news accounts of the trial had contained matter that could prejudice the jurors against Persico. If the newsmen were allowed to remain in the courtroom, the defense argued, subsequent accounts of the trial might include the same kind of matter. The reporters, who contended that their First Amendment rights were being violated, argued also that Justice Postel's remedy was “irrational.” The contested items in their news accounts, they pointed out, were about things that had been said or occurred outside the courtroom. In yesterday's decision, the court held that “the question [presumably of whether Justice Postel had acted correctly] is foreclosed by the determination” of the State Court of Appeals in a 1954 case that “members of the public at large, including the press, possessed no enforceable right or privilege of their own to insist that trials be open to the public.” The majority did not say whether Justice Postel had acted properly or improperly. Instead, it said simply, without elaborating, that “whether this action was an abuse of discretion can be decided on appeal.” But Justice Francis T. Murphy, Jr., in a dissent, said that the majority's own ruling—that the press could not challenge Justice Postel's action—meant, in effect, that no one would be entitled to challenge it. For if the press was barred as a challenger, he said, that would only leave Persico as a possible challenger. And Persico, he pointed out, had already waived his right to public trial by asking that the trial be closed. Should he be convicted, Justice Murphy went on, and then appeal the conviction, he could not argue that Justice Postel had been wrong, for all the judge had done was grant his own request. And if Persico were acquitted, Justice Murphy said, he would not make any appeal at all—the issue, the judge noted, would be “academic.” The majority opinion did not specify how the matter could be appealed. Lawyers said last night that if the extortion case against Persico was dismissed by the judge, the prosecutor could appeal the dismissal, but that if Persico was acquitted by a jury, the prosecution could not appeal. The suit had been brought against Justice Postel by five local reporters — members of the Committee of 100 Reporters formed to challenge Justice Postel's action—and last night both the committee and the lawyer for the five reporters insisted that their fight was not over. “We'll apply to the Court of Appeals tomorrow for a stay of the trial and for an immediate hearing,” said Jacob D. Fuchsberg, the lawyer. He added that yesterday's Appellate Division decision in no way injured the case that five other members of the reporters' committee had brought in Federal Court here, also asking that the Persico trial be reopened to the public. The Federal case is still pending. The newsmen's committee, for its part, said that the Appellate Division had used “the same logic as the military officer in Vietnam who says he was forced to destroy a village in order to save it.” The court's ruling, the committee said, was “like saying that in order to preserve our system of criminal justice, they felt obliged to usurp and destroy it.” Both Mr. Fuchsberg and Martin McLoughlin—a Daily News reporter who helped found the reporters' committee and who issued its statement last night—said they were encouraged by the fact that two of the five Appellate justices had sympathized with their views—Justice Murphy, the dissenter, and Justice George Tilzer. Justice Tilzer concurred with the majority opinion but said in a separate opinion that he concurred only because he felt “compelled” to do so by the Court of Appeals decision of 1954. In fact, he said, he was in agreement of “much” of Justice Murphy's dissent and believed that the time had come for the Court of Appeals to review the matter anew. In his dissent Justice Murphy made many of the arguments the reporters had presented. He said for example, that the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a public trial belonged to the public as well as the defendant. And, he said, the exclusion of the press from the Persico trial violated the First Amendment free‐press guarantee. He contended, too, that the 1954 Court of Appeals decision was irrelevant because it had been decided before the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment was applicable in state as well as Federal trials. The Appellate majority opinion, in effect, ruled only on the first of these issues, that of the Sixth Amendment. But it noted also that a judge was responsible for insuring that publicity does not deny a defendant a fair trial. Also, though it declined to decide whether Justice Postel had “abused his discretion,” it implied that his discretion was broad. The majority said, speaking of Justice Postel, “in the trial judge's discretion,” it this was necessary to protect the defendant's right to a fair trial, so that there would be no basis, in the event of conviction, for reversal.” “The judge must be alert to avoid the opportunity for error that could lead to a new trial at public expense, with new tribulations for the court, juries, witnesses, etc.,” wrote Justice Kupferman in the majority opinion, joined by Justices Arthur Markewich and Aron Steuer. “These are not ‘instant replay’ situations,” Justice Kupferman said. Beyond that, the majority ruled, the opinion of sequestering the jury—an action that the reporters had recommended —is “a form of cruel and unusual punishment (for which there is no crime) and should be used sparingly.”

392-> LABOR TALKS OPEN ON COPPER PACTS
DENVER, May 1— Prelimi nary bargaining has begun on new three‐year contracts be tween 26 unions and the na tion's copper industry, with both sides hoping to avoid a repetition of the eight‐and‐a half‐month struggle that mark ed their 1967–1968 negotiations. “Both sides feel that they lost the last time,” a spokes man for one of the copper companies said. The last labor contracts in the industry were signed after a strike that ended in April, 1968, with the intervention of President Johnson. Those con tracts expire this June 30. Talks between the unions, represented by the National Co ordinated Bargaining Commit tee, and the Anaconda Com pany, one of the Big Four cop per producers, began April 22 in Butte, Mont., covering the company's operations in that state. After two days of prelimi nary meetings, the talks were recessed. They are scheduled to resume Thursday. Union representatives will begin talks with the other‐ big producers in the next two weeks. They will meet with the Phelps Dodge Corporation in Douglas, Ariz.; the American Smelting and Refining Com pany in Denver, and the Ken necott Copper Corporation in Albuquerque, N. M. The unions, headed by the United Steelworkers of Amer ica, which represents about 85 per cent of the workers at the Big Four plants, have an nounced that they will seek settlements similar to those won by the steelmakers in the can industry in March. That settlement amounted to $1.10 an hour in wages over three years. Improved pensions, hospitalization, holidays and other benefits brought the set tlement to an estimated $1.75. A union spokesman said the demands presented to Anacon da included a “very substantial” wage increase, cost‐of‐living es calator clauses, substantial in creases in the $5‐per‐month per year of service formula for pen sions, a shorter work week and hospitalization insurance im provements. The average hourly wages paid by the leading copper com panies is $3.40 an hour, accord ing to the steelworkers. The steelworkers union alone has contracts with 155 compa nies in the nonferrous metals industry, which includes lead and zinc but excludes the can makers, aluminum and steel. These contracts cover 116,355 workers. A Presidential fact‐finding board recommended during the last strike that negotiations be split into three groupings: cop per mine, mill, smelter and re finery workers; copper wire, cable and brass fabricating plant workers, and lead and zinc miners. The unions are following the recommendations and taking the copper talks first, involving 50,000 workers. Among the other unions tak ing part in the talks are the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Work ers, the International Brother hood of Teamsters and the In ternational Union of Operating Engineers. The National Coordinated Bargaining Committee will also negotiate with the six leading “independent” producers — the Magna Copper Company, a di vision of the Newmont Mining Company; the White Pine Cop per Company, a division of the Copper Range Company; the Duval Mining Corporation, a division of Penzoil United, Inc.; the Miami Division of Cities Service Company, the Cyprus Mines Corporation and the In spiration Consolidated Copper Company.

393-> TV: 2 ‘Sensitive’ Subjects Treated
unceremoniously dumped by, as it happens, WCBS‐TV. Mr. Parsons has already been seen on Channel 13 as the reporter covering the Knapp Commission hearings. And this January he will join the staff of the station's new local news program, now slated to be called “The 51st State.” • In “Hogan: Mr. D. A.,” Mr. Parsons concentrates on both the District Attorney himself and the power of the office of the District Attorney. Supporters and critics of Mr. Hogan, including judges, law yers, former assistant D. A.'s and members of juries, con tribute to the portrait. Mr. Hogan declined an invitation to appear on the program. Reviewing the more than three decades of Mr. Hogan's public career, Mr. Parsons found unanimous agreement on the District Attorney's in corruptibility but consider able disagreement on his ef ficiency. “One of the truly remarkable aspects of Fank Hogan,” the program main tained, “is that he more than any other public figure in New York has managed to set himself apart from public scrunity. His office has not published a public report since 1955.” Under the scrutiny of Mr. Parsons, the most interesting theory to emerge is that, during the tumultuous dec ade of the nineteen‐sixties Mr. Hogan did not fully com prehend issues that were radically changing society. Conrad Lynn, a lawyer who has long defended blacks in New York, contends that Mr. Hogan treated his clients fairly in the nineteen‐forties and nineteen‐fifties but that in the nineteen‐sixties things changed, that civil rights demonstrations did “not sit well with Hogan's office.” Black power, peace move ments, campus demonstrators and more permissive life styles became threats to the status quo and, according to critics on the program, tended to overly preoccupy the District Attorney's office as other crises grew. Mr. Parsons obtained confidential internal reports written in 1968 by junior men in Mr. Hogan's department. One called the court system “a garbage can, a place without justice,” adding that “delays are turning the citizens against the District Attor ney's office.” According to one assistant—not named on the program—Mr. Hogan's only reaction was anger at what he considered to be personal attack. On the much‐publicized prosecution of Lenny Bruce, the comedian, former assist ant D. A. Michael Metzger recalls Mr. Hogan's attitude as “hysterical.” On the “Pan ther 21” indictments, an nounced by Mr. Hogan him self on television, a former juror on the trial leading to acquittal found the “frighten ing charges” to be part of “a very weak, in fact, nonexis tent case.” Mr. Parsons reviews a long list of other accusations. Many need further documen tation; many have been cov ered in isolated news stories. Taken as a whole, however, and as presented persuasive ly by Mr. Parsons, the TV documentary managed to buttress its case for public scrutiny. • On WCBS‐TV's “The World of the Male Hustler,” written by Chris Borgen and Eric Ober, a superficially more sensational subject was handled with obvious care, perhaps a bit too obvious. Not intended as an examina tion of homosexuality per se, the program offered fuzzy lensed glimpses into a pro fession as “old as history,” young men selling their bodies to other men. Estimating that 3,000 male prostitutes work the streets of Manhattan, the program trained cameras on the three primary selling grounds: Greenwich Village, Third Av enue on the midtown East Side and Times Square (the “bargain basement for be ginners"). Various experts touched on the obvious dan gers of crime and disease, and two admitted prostitutes faced the cameras directly to discuss the implements clothes, poses and signals— of their “chosen profession.” Most of the hustlers, the documentary pointed out, deny that they themselves are homosexual, but most eventually end up as homo sexuals. And it was esti mated that, against the $80 a week that might be earned washing dishes, the ambitious hustler can make $500 a week “turning tricks.” One hustler admitted that he was concerned by this, primly noting that “people lose the value of a dollar.” • Again on the documentary front, this one off the TV screen, the Film Society of Lincoln Center is this week (Monday through Saturday, at 2:30 and 8:30) presenting “The Television News Docu mentary; a Retrospective of C.B.S. News Broadcasts (1952–1971).” The programs are excellent, and admission is free. And in the week Jan. 3 through 7, Channel 13/WNET will offer “The Murrow Years,” an anthology of Ed ward R. Murrow documen taries featuring related panel discussions and the late com mentator's wife, Janet, as host. The documentary, it seems, present and past, is still showing remarkable signs of life, all other reports to the contrary.

394-> DAY‐CARE CENTER IS DELAYED ON L.I.
GARDEN CITY, L.I., May 15 —The financing by Nassau County of an integrated daycare center for underprivileged children in this affluent community is being delayed by prolonged court litigation. Originally proposed in 1969 by the Unitarian Universalist Church of Central Nassau as a means of combating poverty, the center has angered some residents in the area of the church, at Stewart Avenue and Nassau Boulevard, and has led to numerous lawsuits. Opponents of the center contend that it would create a traffic problem in an area of homes valued at $50,000 to $100,000, destroy the characteristics of the quiet neighborhood, reduce property values and, in the latest court action, violate the state's ban on aid to parochial schools. Predominantly Black Although about 60 per cent of the underprivileged children aged 3 to 5 are expected to be black, opponents deny that racism is the issue. Some proposals of the center think otherwise. The proposal was originally fought in the village through Its Zoning Board of Appeals and later by a group of residents who formed a group called the Committee to Preerve Garden City, headed by Alan S. Forman. The church, which formed the Fellowship Children's Day Care Center, Inc., to operate the center, has been upheld in all litigation thus far. Justice Joseph A. Suozzi of State Supreme Court recently rejected a taxpayer's suit by three residents who challenged the opening of the center on the ground that it violated the Blaine Amendment. The suit, rejected on technical grounds, is expected to be reinstated. Meanwhile, the County Attorney drew up a contract between the county and the newly established corporation that provided that the county pay $54,000 to the center on the rate of $6,000 a month for nine months. Return of Funds The contract, which was signed by Dr. James Shuart, the County Commissioner of Social Services, specifies that none of the money from the county may be spent on anything other than the clients registered through the Department of Social Services and that any money left over at the end of the year would be returned to the county. The County Board of Supervisors, however, has refused to permit County Executive Ralph G. Caso to sign the contract. Its position is that it will not sign the contract while the case is in litigation and while the results of a study of the need for day‐care centers in the county are not complete. The pastor of the church, the Rev. Dr. Irving R. Murray, and its lawyer, Vincent J. Mutari, have pleaded their case on several occasions recently at board meetings, but the board has remained adamant. “They can win by losing,” Dr.” Murray said in an interview. “Their attorney can keep on bringing lawsuits and tie things up.” The board of directors of the day‐care corporation will meet Monday night to determine what to do and will be advised of its legal recourses, which could include a suit against the county, Dr. Murray said. Equipment Purchased He said the church had already spent $6,000 for equipment and a play yard and had contracted to buy a minibus to transport the children to the center. The funds were contributed by the church. Support for the center has come from many clergymen in the community, including Jonathan G. Sherman, Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, which has its headquarters here. Dr. Murray says the Department of Social Services “has 27 kids all Jived up” and that eight more paying clients are ready to join the center. All the children live within a fivemile radius of the church. They live mainly in Hempstead and West Hempstead. The project has the support of the Adelphi University School of Social Work, which hopes to provide students for field training and early childhood education and which has offered its mental health clinic for supportive services for the children's families. “Dr. Murray said that among he parents waiting to place their children in the center Were a mother who wanted an opportunity to finish high school and a working mother ?? two children who was fearful, because of traffic, of permitting her children on the streets in her area. Dr. Murray conceded that some of the existing countyoperated day‐care centers were not filled now because of a lack of professional personnel. But, he said, all the centers will be filled soon because of the need for them In the county, which has 44,0000 preschool children. The need for day‐care centers has increased, he said, be cause recent state legislation requires that able‐bodied women who can work may not receive welfare.

395-> VOTE FUND ISSUE HOLDS UP ACCORD ON TAX MEASURE
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 — A Senate and House conference committee reached agreement today on all parts of the tax bill except for the controversial plan to finance Presidential election campaigns out of tax funds. Representative Wilbur D. Mills, the chairman of the conferees and of the House Ways and Means Committee, said that he expected the final version of the bill to include the campaign funding plan, which the White House has said would cause a Presidential veto of the whole bill. If there is a veto, Mr. Mills said in a noontime speech to the National Capital Democratic Club, then the House might pass a substitute tax bill before the Christmas recess, but the Senate would not. Mr. Mills said he had been assured on the “highest authority”—presumably a reference to the Senate majority leader, Mike Mansfield of Montana—that the Senate could not or would not pass a new tax bill before Christmas. Representative Mills noted that even if the conference committee finished its work immediately it would probably be the end of next week before the House and Senate could pass the conference report and send the bill to Mr. Nixon for his signature or veto. That would leave only a week or so before the Congressional recess for Congress first to attempt to override the veto — which it almost certainly could not do—and then to work out and debate a tax bill that does not contain the campaign funding plan. Just when the conference might reach agreement on the campaign finance plan was far from clear. Committee members were close‐mouthed on the subject when the conference broke up in early evening without reaching agreement. One committee source said there had been no discussion of specific alternatives to the campaign finance plan, which is in the Senate version of the bill. Presumably, the Democratic members were fighting for retention of the plan and the Republican members were opposing it. Some of the Democratic members of the conference were also threatening to make Major amendments in the tax portions of the bill if Mr. Nixon vetoes the bill and they are forced to write a new measure. One such threat, commonly heard among Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committee, is to eliminate the retroactive provision of the investment credit. Under the current bill, businesses will be able to take the credit on equipment ordered on or before April 1 of this year or received on or before Aug. 15. The business community has repeatedly been assured by Administration officials that it could make its investments in equipment with confidence that the investment credit would be in effect, beginning on those dates. The Democrats' threats to eliminate the retroactive dates were thus seen as an attempt to put pressure on Mr. Nixon not to veto the bill. Meanwhile, Administration criticism of the campaign‐financing plan continued. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, George Romney, called the plan “the most self‐serving raid on the Federal Treasury by any political party in this century?” The plan to which the Administration objects would permit any taxpayer to specify that $1 of his tax money should go to financing the next Presidential election. The plan is expected to be of more use to the Democrats, who have more trouble than the Republicans do in raising campaign funds from private sources. Among the major decisions that the conference committee made today on the other sections of the bill were these: ¶The conferees deleted the provision for an additional 26 weeks of unemployment compensation, which would have made the total 65 weeks, in states where unemployment has averaged 6 per cent for 13 consecutive weeks, ¶They retained the tax credit for employers of former welfare clients in the Labor Department's work incentive program. The tax credit would amount to 20 per cent of the wages paid to such a worker in the first 12 months, provided he remained with the same employer for another 12 months. ¶The tax incentive for export sales by American companies was adopted in essentially the version passed by the Senate. Unlike either the House or the Senate version, the conference version has no expiration date; the House would have kept the plan on the books for 10 years and the Senate for five. The export promotion plan involves permitting companies to avoid payment of taxes on profits earned by specially organized domestic ‐ international, sales corporations, provided those profits are plowed into the business in specified ways. ¶The provisions giving the President discretionary authority to impose import quotas and a higher tariff surcharge if he found a serious deterioration in the United States' international economic situation were eliminated. ¶A new section giving the President authority to continue what is known as the “Buy American” provision of the investment credit was written in. It would permit the President to bar the use of the credit on equipment imported from any country that was discriminating against American products, as defined in the Trade Agreements Act. ¶The Senate provision diverting a portion of the taxes collected on alcoholic beverages to the Highway Trust Fund was deleted. ¶A complex provision liberalizing the circumstances in which industrial revenue bonds may be sold as tax‐exempt securities was altered to limit its use to relatively small facilities. Today's committee actions had almost no effect on the total amount of revenue that would be lost by the bill. Committee staff experts said the actions would reduce the revenue loss by a total of about $35‐million, over the next two years. This leaves the bill as a $26billion revenue‐loser, over the current year and the next two.

396-> MARI TSUMURA PUTS COLOR INTO SONATA
Where lyricism, color and delicacy were in demand, Mari Tsumura's playing came close to perfection, in her recital at the Rogers Auditorium in the Metropolitan Museum of Art Monday night. The 23‐year‐old Japanese violinist, who won the Merriweather Post contest in 1967, in Washington, is as pretty as a picture, and she performs that way. She was at her best in the Debussy Sonata. Here Miss Tsumura's velvety torte, flickering coloration and fine‐spun phrases suited the score exactly. She was equally at home in Tartini's “Didone Abandonnate” Sonata and Mozart's Sonata in E minor (K. 304). Her pitch and rhythm were infallible, giving the works precise, classical shape. Miss Tsumura played the other pieces on the program very well, but Brahms's D minor Sonata needed a more robust, rhapsodic digging into the music than She could command. Her virtuosity is not yet of the kind to give off the necessary sparks in the three Paganini works she attempted. A talented and well‐grounded musician, the violinist seems to need to mature more than anything else. Her pianist was David Garvey, as fine as always.

397-> Delay at Indian Point
Unexpectedly cool weather has spared New York City major breakdowns in its electrical power, supply thus far this summer. But power cuts and failures remain a constant threat until adequate capacity can be assured through activation of new generators. Purchase of power from other sources becomes increasingly difficult now that the shortage has become a national problem. Local plants are obsolescent and overburdened. Big Allis is being nursed along, but at the cost of running the giant generator at less than full capacity. All these factors have given special urgency to Con solidated Edison's efforts to activate as soon as pos sible its nearly completed second nuclear power plant at Indian Point in Westchester County. The facility, being built under a construction license granted by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1966, would nor mally have received its operating license at the con clusion of a series of public hearings now in their final stages. That schedule, however, has been upset by new delays and uncertainties. As an aftermath of a court ruling in the case of another nuclear plant in Baltimore, the commission has issued new regulations and will follow these with revised environmental guidelines. On a national basis, the new approach should prove helpful in keeping the A.E.C. from neglecting ecological safe guards in its eagerness to expand power sources. But the record over ten years of nuclear study and operation indicates that Con Edison has given diligent attention to safety and environment at Indian Point. In view of the critical state of the city's power supply and the sudden changes in the rules, the A.E.C. has an obligation to eliminate all unnecessary administra tive delays in passing on the new facility's eligibility to operate. Careful activation and fueling of the new plant will take about six months at best. Con Edison has appealed for an expedited schedule of hearings under the new guidelines, to be followed by an interim license to operate at 20 per cent of the new plant's capacity. The emphasis thus is properly on avoiding bureaucratic obstruction, without sacrificing safety. The city's users of electric power, including virtually all its vital services, cannot indefinitely rely on a source of supply kept func tioning by precarious manipulations and prayer.

398-> A Front of Catholic Dissenters Is Formed by 38 Groups in Italy
ROME, Oct. 25 — Thirty eight progressive Roman Cath olic communities and groups have formed a front for dis sent and independence from the church hierarchy. After a three‐day congress dealing with “relations be tween the church and the state in Italy,” the dissenters issued a statement today announcing their decision to unite in a co ordinated movement. The 380 priests and laymen from parochial groups all over Italy who attended are said to represent 4,000 militants. Eight church communities were rep resented, including the “Iso lotto” of Florence and “Ore gina” of Genoa, dissident groups that have not openly split with the church. The dissenters identified themselves as Catholics who “have rediscovered the full di mension of their Christian lib erty and who have liberated themselves from subjection to the hierarchy. The congress, in its final statement, pledged to fight against “the clerical structures in all their forms and in par ticular against the Concordat and its implications.” The 1929 Concordat is currently under discussion between the Vatican and the Italian Gov lernment. Parliamentary com missions are discussing a revi sion of the Concordat and there are pressures from the Socialist party for its abrogation. Denouncing the Concordat, the congress rejected certain specific privileges that it gives to the Catholic Church in Italy, such as obligatory religious edu cation in schools, religious serv ices in military barracks and the indissolubility of religious marriage. The dissenters also took a strong stand against the move ment that is promoting a refer endum to void this country's law permitting divorce. Describ ing the referendum as a “cleri cal‐Fascist” action, they said they would try to impede the use of church structures to pro mote the referendum.

400-> Celtics Subdue Knicks, 105‐97
Not yet ready to relinquish first place in the National Basketball Association's Atlantic Division, the Boston Celtics ran the New York Knicks into submission at Madison Square Garden last night and scored a 105‐97 victory. It was the first time in two seasons that the Celtics had been able to win a game from the Knicks, who had beaten them eight times in a row, including twice this season. And it brought Boston's won‐lost record to 16‐10, two full games better than New York's 14‐12. The other six teams in the Eastern conference are all under .500. A 31‐14 third quarter decided the game after the Knicks had emerged from the first half with a 52‐21 lead on a lastsecond tap‐in by Jerry Lucas. In the third period, the Celtics swept both boards, hit more than half their shots from the floor and outraced the Knicks in both directions. The Knicks, meanwhile, missed 14 of the first 15 shots they took, committed seven turnovers to Boston's two, failed to score in the first four minutes of the period and fell behind by as much as 82‐64. But the Knicks did have one answering burst in them, and when Boston tried to slow things down a bit in the fourth quarter, the Knicks fought back into contention. They were behind, 86‐76, with almost seven minutes to play, and very much alive at 93‐88 with 2:24 left. However, Jo‐Jo White, pressed by Dick Barnett as he tried to start upcourt, dribbled the length of the floor and went in for a layup. Although Bill Bradley answered with a quick goal, White promptly followed with two free throws for a 97‐90 margin. At 1:26, White's jumper made it 99‐91, and that settled matters. White finished with 26 points and John Havlicek with 25. Dave Cowens, playing despite a bad back, had 14 rebounds. But as much as anything, the close guarding defense paid off for the Celtics as they forced 25 turnovers. An important feature of the game for New York was the return to action of Earl Monroe. He played 15 minutes and was obviously rusty. His shots were off (4 for 12) and he couldn't move at full speed. Unless Monroe and Willis Reed get into top shape, the Knicks won't have the sort of team that they'll need in the playoffs. Reed will blend easily enough when he is sound physically, but Monroe also needs playing time with his new teammates. Last night, at least, he began to get it. The last time Boston was here, the game (won by the Knicks) resembled a track meet. This one was more like a roller derby, with bodies as well as feet flying. There were enough missed layups on both sides to stock a high school gym, but this was often the natural consequence of the terrific tempo of play. And with mobile centers on both teams, the middle was often open for a drive—or a collision. Among the 19,588 spectators was Bill Russell, the man who led the Celtics to 11 titles in 13 years, and who especially tormented the Knicks. “You see?” said an admirer who had always insisted on Russell's importance, “it's enough for the Celtics simply to have him in the building.”

To the Editor: After reading David L. DeCourcy's imposing analysis of Lieutenant Cal ley's trial for the Mylai massacre (let ter Dec. 25) which in essence is a small‐scaled Nuremberg reproduction, I am disposed to accept as fact that the three top institutions surrounding American life are corrupt politics, mystical religion and racism. I conclude that these three founda tions are obstacles interwoven into the texture of America's social fabric. They embrace the cardinal points of ruling authority that are responsible for man's long history of cruel folly.

409-> PACERS TRIUMPH OVER NETS, 119‐114
WEST HEMPSTEAD, L. I., Dec. 7 (AP)—Roger Brown scored half of his 22 points in the final period to lead the Indiana Pacers to a 119‐114 victory over the New York Nets tonight in an American Basketball Association game. Brown and a reserve guard, Mary Winkler, helped the Pacers to their sixth victory in seven games. Winkler added 9 points, helping to offset the gaine's high of 44 by Rick Barry of the Nets. Winkler put the Pacers in front for good with 5:44 remaining, when he hit a jumper to make it 102‐101. Seconds later, the 6‐foot‐1‐inch guard got a 3‐point goal. The Nets went into the final 12 minutes leading, 86‐84, as Barry and Bill Melchionni each had 8 points, helping to wipe out a 56‐55 Pacer edge at halftime. INDIANA (119) NETS (114)  G. F. P.  G. F.

410-> A Prime Election Issue in San Francisco Is a Proposed Ban on High Rise Buildings
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 31— Although the race for mayor has attracted more attention, a proposition that would vir tually end all high‐rise build ing in San Francisco has be come a prime issue in Tues day's municipal election. The proposition has triggered a bitter fight, largely pitting those who call themselves urban conservationists against big business and the construction industry. So controversial is the prop osition, that with the cam paign now in its final days both sides agree that the issue is still in doubt. However, both sides held polls showing that they were out in front. Supporters of the height limit predicted that they would get at least 55 per cent of the vote. And on the other side, opponents of the initia tive said that their polls showed the proposition would be defeated. ‘Manhattanization Decried’ The basic issue behind the proposition is what people here call the “Manhattanization” of San Francisco. They point out that in the last five years, 21 new high‐rise office buildings were built in the downtown area, vastly altering the city's skyline. It was as a result of this construction boom that the high‐rise revolt began. “Do we want to become another Man hattan?” opponents of the sky scrapers asked. From the start, the opposition was led by Alvin Duskin, a dress manufacturer. Once the opponents of high rise building had marshaled their forces, they persuaded the, city's Board of Supervisors late last year to halt the United States Steel Corporation from building a 40‐story, 550‐ foot tower on the city's water front. After that, petitions were cir culated to have a proposition put on the ballot that would prevent construction of any building in the city more than six stories —or 72 feet—high unless specific approval was given by the voters. Mr. Duskin's petitions were successful. The vote here Tuesday will mark the first time that voters of a major American city have. attempted to halt the construc tion of skyscrapers. But San Franciscans have history of firsts. It was here, just over a decade ago, that voters rebelled against freeway construction. And on that oc casion, too, they were suc cessful. The battle against high‐rise buildings was stepped up yes terday when both sides were compelled to disclose their fi nancial backers. A new controversy erupted when it was found that the ‐largest contributors in the fight against the proposition included two major utilities— the Pacific Telephone Company ‐and the Pacific Gas and Elec tric Company. Both were listed as having contributed $10,000. Similar $10,000 contributions to defeat the proposition were made by the Standard Oil Company, the Bank of America and Milton Meyer & Co., a San Francisco based real estate firm. Immediately after the dis closures were made, Mr. Dus kin announced that lawsuits would be filed against the util ities. He said that it would be a class action “on behalf of all the people who pay gas and phone bills which may be in creased as a result of the utili ties' involving themselves in local political campaigning.” ‐The proposition faces wide opposition. Both of the city's .newspapers have urged a “no” vote as have the Chamber of Commerce and Mayor Joseph L. Alioto. The newspapers called the proposition “mis taken and highly dangerous” and said that its passage would result in increased taxes. Mayor Alioto, in speaking out against the proposition, argued that “everything over r.six stories is not ugly or evil, and every two‐story building is not beautiful.” Mrs. Dianne Feinstein, the president of the Board of Su pervisors and a candidate for Mayor, said that she, too, was against the proposition but was opposed to Manhattanization of San Francisco by high‐rise ‐.developers.” She said that she did not agree with details of the pro posal, particularly the arbitrary height limit that it sets. Harold Dobbs, another may oralty candidate, said that he, too, was opposed to the propo sition. “I applaud the senti ment behind it,” he said, “but deplore the unworkable me chanics it contains.” Supporters of the proposi tion argue that such construc tion not only destroys the char acter of the city but also con tributes to pollution and costs more in services than it pro dUces in taxes. Mr. Duskin and his support ers detailed their arguments in a 256‐page book, “The Ultimate High Rise,” which was pub lished last week. The book was produced by The Bay Guardian, a local newspaper.

To the Editor: Regardless of its success or failure, the present Laotian incursion by the South Vietnamese army, with Ameri can logistical and air support, may quite conceivably result in an earlier end of our involvement in the Viet nam war. Since this is a real possibil ity, it appears to me that the renewed campaign by some of the “end‐the war” Advocates is unnecessary. I contend that if the present Laotian campaign succeeds in cutting off the North Vietnamese supplies coming over the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the exodus of our troops from South Vietnam will be accelerated, because the North Vietnamese would then be less likely to be a threat to our remaining troops as each American contingent sails for home. On the other hand, if the South Vietnamese troop suffer a serious de feat in Laos, the doom of the Vietnami zation program will have been sounded. We would then have no alternative— with the American public weary over the length and cost of the Vietnam war—to accelerating the rate of with drawal of all our forces from South Vietnam as rapidly at their safety would allow. This country, under such circumstances, would be forced to wipe the slate clean in Vietnam, regardless of future consequences in Southeast Asia, or elsewhere in the world. Why should not the active dissent era to our policy refrain from their present attempt to hasten the future? Their past efforts have already in fluenced our Government to under take a retreat from our international responsibilities. Is it not time to support our Government's policy, which appears to me to be a sincere effort to comply with the current Mood of the American people? Marblehead, Mass., Feb. 25, 1971

412-> Pothole Superintendent
Exactly fourteen months ago a City Hall spokesman conceded that, as a result of unusual weather condi tions, the pothole situation had become critical. Now, after a new round of announcements about the annually unusual weather, a state of crisis has again been admitted to exist. Not at all unusual is the fact that emergency action has, once again, evidently awaited public complaint. What ought to be a routine aspect of city maintenance thus takes the form of instant political reaction to insistent demand. Otherwise, why should Mayor Lindsay have found it necessary to pose with the antipothole brigade a couple of days ago as it opened its offensive in Queens? Since emergency services have a way of running out of steam as soon as the spotlight of publicity is switched off, it may be useful to remember that potholes may be reported by a call to Worth 4‐2110. There is, how ever, no guarantee that Mr. Lindsay will supervise each job in person.

To the Editor: It is interesting to note that at a time when the Ad Hoc Committee of Afro‐Americans Concerned about United States Policy in Africa is re minding the President of the short sighted nature of American policies in Africa, one African (or is it?) nation has been the topic of the American mass media. On Dec. 13 The Times ran a news article on Ethiopian food. Only a week before “The Hidden Em pire” was broadcast on national TV. As the oldest recipient of the largest sum of United States aid, Ethiopia has little to show for all this, other than a small but sophisticated armed force supporting a Government that pro vides space for one of the largest United States intelligence bases, and the only one in Africa. The presence of this base has been decried by the Organization of African Unity on sev eral occasions. The point to be made here Is that like many of the states in Indochina. Ethiopia is viewed by the United States as a state out of a Jonathan Swift novel. What appeals to Ameri cans and indeed at times seems to set the guidelines for diplomatic policy are those picturesque and medieval characteristics of kings, glorious tem pies, churches and exotic ways of life. These the United States tries to preserve as living museums. The price of course, is the wretched state of the people while the caretakers grow fat. A recent example was the Dec. 30 news article on Eritreans fleeing Ethiopia as a result of repression by U.S. arms, In many ways Ethiopia has all the makings of a Cambodia, a Thailand or a Laos because of United States mill tary involvement in internal affairs; the presence of United States operat ing bases for transactions which bene fit only the United States; and primari ly through military aid, supporting regimes that purport to be against Communism no matter how brutally they repress their own subjects. Ironically it is in Ethiopia that the headquarters for the O.A.U. is sit uated, cheek‐to‐jowl with what might be termed the African center for United States communications (Kag new base). It is not at all strange that President Nixon could not find time for President Kaunda but did find time to meet with the Emperor of Ethiopia. As an Afro‐American and a native of Ethiopia, I cannot help feeling that United States relations with Africa and Asia are much like Gulliver in Lilliput coupled with the fear of an impossible humiliation.

414-> Family‐Planning Breakthrough
American leadership in the worldwide effort to curb the population explosion should be substantially strength ened by the new $382‐million family planning bill which President Nixon recently signed into law. The measure is primarily designed to deal with this country's own population problem through vastly ex panded family planning services and research and coor dination of Federal population activities. But this land mark domestic action also has far‐reaching international implications. The provision of $145 million for population research in the United States over the next three years could be particularly helpful to other countries because it will accelerate the development of new birth control tech nology. The lack of cheap, safe, reliable and readily acceptable birth control techniques has been a major obstacle to effective family planning everywhere, espe cially in some of the developing countries. Expansion of American family planning research cen ters will provide additional opportunities for foreign scientists to acquire techniques applicable In their own countries. American experience with family planning clinics under the bill should also be useful to other countries. Perhaps most important of all, the family planning bill demonstrates to a sometimes skeptical international public that the United States intends to practice at home what it has been preaching to the world with increasing urgency in recent years. Efforts to promote more vigor ous population programs in the United Nations have been resisted recently by the representatives of some developing countries who have questioned American motives. This United States exercise in self‐control should help to disarm such critics and to encourage others to recognize the universal seriousness of the population problem.

NEWPORT, R. I., June 22— James French Baldwin's 61‐foot sloop, Sorcery, was the first yacht to finish the biennial An napolis‐to‐Newport yacht race tonight. Sorcery crossed the finish line at 9:50 P.M. Her elapsed time for the 473 mile race was 77 hours 50 minutes 21 seconds and her corrected time was 68 hours 18 minutes. Ted Turner's 12‐Meter yacht American Eagle, was the second finisher at 10:45 P.M. Ameri can Eagle's elapsed time was 78:45:02. He corrected time was 69:30:26. Sorcery, designed by two Canadian naval architects, Cuthbertson and Cassion, could win top honors in her class as early as 3:31 A.M. tomorrow. That's when time would run out on the last boat in her class with a chance to beat her. There were no reports on any of the other 88 yachts in the race, which started Saturday afternoon. Until Sorcery's arrival, the race had threatened to become the slowest since Newport be came the finishing point for this event in 1957.

418-> A Plan for the Sinai—
. the protection of thick layers of steel and natural stone brought from central Israel, far to the north, a young Israeli soldier —a new immigrant from Egypt—ig nores the strict order against shout ing across the Suez Canal by enter taining an audience on the other side with an imitation of Farid al‐Atrash, a popular Egyptian singer. North of Qantara, an Egyptian soldier does handstands and performs other acro batic feats, winning applause from across the canal. The scene is so peaceful that an other outburst of war seems incon ceivable; the idea that these men might start shooting at one another simply because the clock has struck 12 is grotesque. But throughout Israel public and official attention is cen tered on one question: how to avoid more fighting. cease ‐ fire that took effect along the canal Aug. 8 gave the Is raelis a much‐needed respite. The newspapers' front pages lost their for mer gloom; photographs of the previ ous day's dead no longer cast a shadow over all other news; one could afford to miss an hourly newscast. With typical vengeance, the Is raelis plunged into their internal wars. Industrial disputes and wildcat strikes mushroomed all over the country. The traditional feud between the secular sector and the religious sector scaled new heights of absurdi ty in a fight over a car race scheduled for a Saturday (the religious parties bought up the race from the promot ers and postponed it to a Sunday, but unruly crowds broke into the track and the race was canceled). The fighting in the Labor party, ac centuated by a clash between Moshe Dayan, the Defense Minister, and Yigal Allon, the Deputy Premier, reached a new intensity. Cabinet pro ceedings were leaked to the press as a matter of routine, and when an inner kitchen cabinet met secretly to debate measures against leaks, the proceedings were reported in the press the next day. The first sex boutique in Tel Aviv opened despite a loud protest from shocked conserva tives; after 4,000 years of Jewish cul ture, the first nude Hebrew play was produced in the face of another up roar. The temporary peace enhanced the yearning of Israelis for an end to war and a life without danger. They seemed to realize that the precarious lull would not last forever, and they kept one worried eye on that ominous date, Feb. 5, when the cease‐fire agreement expires and the blissful silence along the canal may give way to the sounds of war. The mood of the country explains why Allon and Dayan, the two promi nent pretenders to Mrs. Golds Meir's Premiership, vied for public favor by being mild and dovish. The Israeli insistence on a total withdrawal of Soviet and Egyptian missiles from the standstill zone, so vociferously made in November, was quietly dropped. The Government, having in the proc ess lost much of its credibility, de cided to resume the talks presided over by Gunnar V. Jarring, the United Nations intermediary. With his usual knack for summing up the public's mood in simple words, Dayan says: “I'm not afraid of the Egyptians. I'm afraid of war.” can war be avoided? The disagreement between Israel and Egypt covers a variety of subjects: the nature of future relations between them, freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal, the Soviet presence in Egypt and the refugee problem. But above all looms the security issue, and the crux of this issue is the future of Sinai, which borders the canal. An agreement on this fundamental ques tion would overshadow all other out standing differences. From the Israeli point of view, the Suez Canal is primarily a convenient defense line. It is, as Allon puts it, “the best antitank ditch we have.” It is also the shortest defense line; it is manned almost exclusively by ordinary army units, and the total number of soldiers stationed there is surprisingly low. It is a line that can be maintained without enlisting the reserves or draining the manpower at home—without imposing too heavy a burden on the already overburdened economy. The question is whether the canal can serve its defensive pur pose without Israeli troops along its bank. The face‐to‐face confrontation along the canal is not the outcome of any planned policy on the part of the Israeli Government or chief of staff. The image of the Israeli Army as the paradigm of efficiency, a well‐oiled machine operated by first‐rate mili tary planners, masks a reality in which improvisation, chance and courage play a primary role. The sequence of events along the canal is an almost classic case of escalation governed by the momentum of daily events, not by planning. From the very start, Dayan was wary of the canal. On the first day of the 1967 war he ordered his troops to stop 20 miles from the canal; it was an almost reflexive repetition of an order issued in the Suez War of 1956. No sooner was the order issued in the Six‐Day War, however, than it was rescinded and the Israelis rushed to the canal in the wake of the crushed Egyptian Army. They found themselves within artillery range of Suez, Egypt's second‐largest port and major industrial center; Port Said was at their mercy; Ismailia's power sta tion was within rifle shot. Here stood one of Egypt's major centers, defense less and totally unprepared for war. Their position, the Israelis argued, was the ultimate deterrent to re newed fighting. In those postwar days, Israeli officers used to bring foreign visitors to the pier in Port Taufiq, which protrudes into the Gulf of Suez, and—pointing to the ships and stacks on the other side—say: “You are standing right now on the safest strip of land Israel has.” The Israelis did not even bother to dig in. No one but a madman, they reasoned, would endanger the lives and safety of a million people and three major towns by exposing them to Israeli fire. In September, 1968, when President Nasser ordered civilians evacuated from the canal zone and began artil lery barrages, the Israelis were caught off guard. Only when they realized that Nasser was ready to make tremendous human and economic sacrifices to hurt Israel did they begin to build the Barley Line, a response to the growing strength of Russian supplied artillery. More Egyptian shells resulted in thicker bunkers, but the Barley Line stood fast. More than 1,000 guns spewed hundreds of thou sands of shells along the 100‐mile strip, scorching the yellow ground and pock‐marking the thin asphalt roads. Yet not one outpost gave in to the guns or to the Egyptian com mandos who crossed the canal at night. It was a bloody war. The Israelis lost 375 men, and to hold the line they were forced to use their air force as “a flying artillery.” The air force was called in primarily to relieve the pressure on units stationed along the canal. The planes struck in hundreds of ?? and managed to save the Barley Line. The resort to air power had another effect, however: it brought the first direct Soviet inter vention, adding a new and dangerous dimension to the Arab‐Israel conflict. CAN this process of escalation be reversed? A proposal widely attrib uted to Dayan attempts to give a positive answer; it suggests the crea tion of a demilitarized zone along the canal, which would be opened to international navigation. The idea is not new. Mati Peled, a reserve general who writes for Ma'ariv, the Tel Aviv evening paper, has argued that an open canal would act as a barrier between the two armies, that the passage of merchant ships is the safest guarantee against the resumption of hostilities. Accord ing to Peled's analysis, Moscow would benefit from an open and peaceful canal and would therefore deter Egypt from following an aggressive policy toward Israel. Peled disputes the Israeli insistence on the right of passage for Israeli ships. He contends that the exclusion of Israeli shipping is a price worth paying for the bene fits accruing from an open canal. He regards the Government policy of “either we sail or none shall” as shortsighted and dictated primarily by considerations of prestige. Dayan's plan—if one may call it that—has not been clearly defined. In a typically mad Israeli fashion, it was blared out in the press by journalists associated with Dayan's inner sanctum and hailed as the ultimate panacea even before it was presented to the Cabinet—or, for that matter, before anyone knew what it was all about. Described as “something less than total withdrawal,” the plan provides for partial de militarization—the withdrawal of armor and artillery—along both sides of the canal. The news of the proposal caused heated debate in the press. Columnists and commentators argued its pros and cons; radio and TV panels discussed its ramifications; only the Government was kept in the dark, and Ministers had to scan the newspapers to find out how the plan was faring. Finally, in the beginning of December, when Mrs. Meir asked Dayan to divulge his secret formula to his col leagues in the Cabinet, he dis claimed responsibility for the plan published in the press (where, he complained, he has “many enemies”). Dayan—Is rael's answer to the Prince of Denmark — left the proposal and its advocates hanging in mid‐air and took off for the United States, where he flatly denied the existence of “the plan.” As the proposal's critics point out, partial demilitariza tion and the opening of the canal have many disadvan tages from an Israeli point of view. Moving the troops away from the canal would, accord ing to reliable sources, triple the size of the force needed for an effective defense line. Even if demilitarization along the canal were observed, Egypt could strike elsewhere in Sinai and Israel would be faced with a dilemma: any Israeli retaliation across the canal or its closure by Israel, no matter how strong the prov ocation, would be denounced around the world. On the other hand, Israel would find it dif ficult to strike back at Egypt outside the canal zone; central Egypt is heavily defended against both ground and air attacks. The military commentator of Ha'aretz, the Tel Aviv daily, said the idea showed “a lack of elementary understanding.” He argued that by allowing the opening of the canal, Israel would surrender her trump card without gaining peace or security. Eliezer Livneh, a for mer Labor leader and now an independent columnist, dis missed the idea as “wholly stupid.” It would, he argued, serve Soviet imperialistic in terests by establishing a direct link between the Soviet fleet in the Mediterranean and the growing Soviet sphere of in fluence in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, and would in vite further Soviet pressure on Israel. Even Dayan supporters were appalled by the way the plan was broadcast to the public without resort to regular dip lomatic channels. And some journalists thought the whole notion was merely a political promotion gimmick, explain able in terms of intraparty rivalry. The passionate debate in Is rael ignored the Egyptian rejection of the idea. For the Egyptians, disengagement along the canal, despite its obvious economic advantages, means an acceptance of the Israeli occupation of Sinai and a negation of everything Egypt has been fighting for since June, 1967. President Anwar al‐Sadat, pressed by the army to follow a more rigid policy, could hardly start his career by agreeing to an interim measure which would in effect freeze the territorial status quo. In the eyes of the Egyp tians, both sides of the canal are their territory; the idea that they should withdraw their armor and artillery from Egyptian territory in return for an Israeli withdrawal from what they regard as Egyptian territory, does not, to put it mildly, appeal to them. IF there is merit in the Dayan plan, it lies in the pro posal's modest attitude—the hope of something less than peace in exchange for some thing less than war. With the resumption of the Jarring talks, such less than total pro posals acquire immediate im portance. In Israel, such plans have recently been toyed with by politicians, columnists and all thinking people. “There is no erosion in the Israeli stand merely because the Cabinet is debating an interim formula which falls short of either peace or war,” says Abba Eban, the Foreign Minister. “Occasionally, one should not exclude interim arrange ments within the cease ‐ fire agreements to insure growing stability while the efforts to reach a durable peace are in progress.” A senior Israeli has sug gested that the first in a series of interim arrangements would be the restoration of Egyptian civilian authority in Sinai. He stressed that such a step could be taken by Israel because it would not affect her security. It would drama tize the essential aim of Israeli policy: defense, but not an nexation. It would not be a purely symbolic gesture. A restoration of Egyptian civil jurisdiction in Sinai would mean the return of rich oil fields and other mineral re sources to Egyptian ownership and would give a sorely needed boost to Cairo's stagnating economy. It would also de mand day‐to‐day cooperation between Israelis and Egyptians and require a give‐and‐take psychology on both sides. This search for an interim arrangement results from the feeling that a prolonged ex tension of the cease‐fire would have to be accompanied by some gesture from Israel, something the Egyptians could accept in return for a new and more solid agreement. Because the Jarring talks are going to be arduous and lengthy, at best, some provisional solu tion will have to be found. Such a solution will have to steer between the Scylla of the Egyptian refusal to make real peace and the Charybdis of the Israeli refusal to withdraw completely from Sinai. A return to the old southern border would be a security disaster for Israel. That border stretches for 130 miles from the Mediterranean shore to the Gulf of Aqaba, climbs mountainous peaks, plunges into wadis and crawls along endless wasteland. From an Israeli point of view the for mer southern border, even if the Gaza Strip remained under Israeli control, would be prac tically indefensible. The small regular army could not pos sibly defend even short stretches of it, and the re serves would have to be called in. Such a massive call‐up causes a virtual standstill in the Israeli economy, a total breakdown of the educational system, a psychological stress among civilians. To effectively defend this border, Israel would have to stop breathing. The country can do so — its economy is geared for this eventuality — but only for short periods. In the two‐week call‐up which preceded the Six‐Day War, the country did stop breathing, but by the time war broke out, it seemed that Israel and Is raelis had reached the bursting point. Long periods of total mobilization could strangle the country economically, cul turally and psychologically without one shot from the Egyptians. The return of Arab forces to Sinai would mean that every alert along the border would result in a long period of breathless preparedness in Israel. Unlike the war of at trition, which was tolerable because it was handled by small regular‐army units, any future trouble on the previous desert border will be unbear able. This menacing border situa tion may be compounded by the presence of Soviet forces, planes or even civilian per sonnel in Sinai. Their presence would deter Israel from driv ing into Sinai and repeating the feats of 1967. Even worse, Soviet antiaircraft missiles in Sinai would be in a position to threaten three of Israel's major military airports. Short range ground‐to‐ground mis siles supplied by the Soviet Union might endanger all of southern Israel. In other words, Egypt would be able to paralyze day‐to‐day life in Israel without risking counter measures because a retaliation on the desert borders would have no effect on the heart land of Egypt. No paper peace, no mere signature, no verbal recognition of its “right to exist” can compensate Is rael for this possible danger. Israel's predicament, pecul iar to a country which must rely on total mobilization for its defense, gives Sinai its strategic importance. The Sinai, a wilderness mostly un inhabitable by Western stan dards, lies at the very root of a future Israeli‐Egyptian modus vivendi, and it can play varying roles in any settlement. YIGAL ALLON, who ordered the first Israeli withdrawal from Sinai in January, 1949, says: “Sinai can be one of three things: First, it can be a launching pad for attacks and armed invasion on either Is rael or Egypt; second, it can serve as a death trap, as it has done, for the armies sta tioned there; third, it can be a buffer zone separating the two countries.” Allon and a majority of his colleagues in the Cabinet would like to see Sinai serve the third purpose. An effectively demilitarized Sinai, says Allon, would re move the threats to both Is rael and Egypt. Without air ports and planes ready to take off, Sinai loses much of its ominousness. Shorn of its armor and artillery, it be comes militarily innocuous. The area is not suitable for ordinary infantry warfare, and guerrilla tactics are excluded by the nature of the terrain. The demilitarization of Sinai is feasible. Only two major roads cut through the granite mountains, plateaus and sandy dunes, and it is impossible to move troops across the penin sula secretly; aerial recon naissance would spot any such movement before it could cover a substantial distance. As a demilitarized wasteland, Sinai can be a “sand curtain” separating the two sides, al laying deep mutual fears. If interim arrangements could be made for demilita rization of Sinai, the deadlock might be broken. For Israelis, the crucial question is how to ensure the maintenance of the demilitarization. Contempo rary history abounds with broken demilitarization agree ments — including the 1949 armistice pact between Israel and Egypt, which broke down in 1953 amid recriminations and bickering. As Yigal Allor points out, the closest thing to a built‐in guarantee would be supervision by joint Israeli Egyptian teams. A great advantage of a de militarization agreement is that it can be tried in practice and carried out in stages. It need not be accompanied from the start by a formal peace treaty — which the Egyptians regard as “humiliating”—and it could give each party the opportunity to “feel out” the other's intentions. EACH geographic stage of demilitarization would consist of the destruction of military installations, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the return of Egyptian civil authorities and unarmored police units and the immediate establishment of joint teams to inspect and control the demilitarized zone. Any such agreement would eventually have to cover a large part of Sinai, including the southern coast and its rich oil fields. In this way Egypt would receive a partial return of the territory and full res titution of her economic re sources without the total peace which is so objection able in her eyes. Israel would hold on to such strategic strips as Sharm el Sheik, the road leading up to it and the north ern strip, the fate of which will have to be decided as part of the final stage of the settlement, a peace treaty. By that time experience will have been gained and—who knows? — emotions subdued. Such a step‐by‐step solution may change the attitudes of both parties on what they re gard as nonnegotiable items. Egypt's concept of her future relations with Israel and Is rael's idea of secure borders may become modified in the light of demilitarization. The success of such a plan is bound to have a deep effect on both countries. In this way, peace, probably unattainable at present, may become a na tural and logical conclusion to the impasse. As a matter of principle, the same step‐by‐step ap proach could be implemented by an international peace keeping force instead of the joint inspection team. Secre tary of State William Rogers advanced the prospects of such a plan at a recent Wash ington news conference. He said the United States is “pre pared to play a responsible role in providing guarantees,” and, while rejecting as “total ly impractical” the idea of a joint Soviet‐American force, admitted: “We have not ex cluded the possibility that the United States might play a peace‐keeping role.” Rogers's statement was not, as he has stressed, a declaration of American policy, but it does testify to Washington's readi ness to take an active part in enforcing and insuring effec tive disengagement. An international peace‐keep ing force would probably be more palatable to Cairo than a joint Egyptian‐Israeli force because it would exclude the presence of Israelis on Egyp tian soil. It would be less ap pealing to the Israelis. Any international peace‐keeping force in which Americans participate would necessarily include Soviet units and would, as Rogers quite clearly indicated, “be done under the auspices of the Security Coun cil of the United Nations.” The idea of Russians along their borders fills the Israelis with horror, for the Soviet Union is regarded as a much greater menace than its allies. Equally repugnant is the Idea of U.N. control over the peace keeping force. This would mean that the effectiveness of demilitarization would be de pendent on an organization in which Israel is habitually and automatically condemned and in which the Soviet Union exercises the veto as a matter of course. Mrs. Meir has re fused to take a stand on this tentative proposal, but it is doubtful whether Israel would agree to a guarantee policed by the Security Council. TO the tired observer of the Middle East, this proposal probably sounds slightly uto pian. Lofty words and ugly deeds have long characterized this part of the globe. Indeed the chances that a solution can be found are slim. In re cent interviews, Mrs. Meir and President Sadat demonstrated the huge distance between their governments. While the Israeli Premier stressed above all the need for a lasting peace, Sadat vowed never to estab lish diplomatic relations with Israel. The Egyptian President said that nothing short of a total Israeli withdrawal would satisfy his country, and he failed to promise even free dom of navigation for Israeli shipping in the Suez Canal. Moreover, in a series of al most daily harangues, Sadat made bellicose statements ominously reminiscent of Nas ser's speeches just before the Six‐Day War. Sadat has said repeatedly that the fighting will resume on Feb. 5 unless a timetable for complete Is raeli withdrawal is agreed up on before then. In a speech at Tanta, north of Cairo, on Jan. 4, he threatened to wage total war “in the field, in the factory, in the street, in the village and in the town.” If Sadat's remarks were not mere muscle‐flexing, a pro logue before entering the Jar ring talks, they exclude any foreseeable modus vivendi, let alone peace between the two countries. But if common sense has managed to survive the bitter conflict, there is a slight chance for some kind of settle ment. From an Israeli point of view, even partial demilita rization of Sinai has its risks: any Egyptian contravention of the agreement would force Is rael to march into the de militarized zone, be branded as the party guilty of upset ting the territorial status quo and consequently be regarded —by U.N. standards—as the aggressor. It also has its ad vantages, however. A partial demilitarization will not bring formal peace, nor will it real ly insure Israeli freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal. But it will mean a trouble‐free southern border and a chance to reduce defense expenditures. From an Egyptian point of view, such a plan would con tain some bitter pills: the gradual and only partial Is raeli withdrawal from Sinai, the need to cooperate with Is rael, the presence of Israelis in the joint inspection teams. Yet Egypt has every reason to opt for an honorable end to a dispute which has drained her resources, hampered her social progress, paralyzed the canal and brought in a for eign power more imperialistic than the British, whom the Egyptians battled to expel. If President Sadat is really intent — as he has often said — on directing his country's energies toward internal re forms, a demilitarized Sinai would create the shield behind which Egypt could do just that. There are growing signs that at least the intelligentsia in Egypt are eager to disen tangle the country from the Palestine conflict. Nasser's death — attributed by large masses of Egyptians to “those Palestinians” — and the grow ing ties with the Sudan and Libya have accentuated the trend, perceived by many for eign visitors, toward a return to the historic, African Egypt. The decline of the fedayeen and their palpable incompe tence must strengthen those who are tired of and disillu sioned with the costly war against Israel. Finally, Egypt must realize that if war is resumed she would face a re furbished and much stronger Israel. A new war would be dis astrous for Egypt. Israel may lose men along the canal, but Egypt will lose all, hope for social and economic progress. A prolonged war along the canal, without Nasser's cha risma, could shake the precari ous political balance in Egypt, topple Sadat and eliminate any vestige of civilian government. And more war is bound to bring in more Russians. ACTUALLY, when one looks at the Egypt‐Israel con flict from a long‐range per spective, the deadlock seems to be the result of political blunders and misapprehen sions. Egypt was traditionally neutral on the Palestine con flict and, up to 1948, never sided with the Palestinian Arabs. This basic neutrality was demonstrated during the Arab riots of 1936 to 1939, when the Palestinian Arabs fought the Jews and hundreds of casualties fell on both sides. In those bitter days, Egypt played host to Jewish and Zionist organizations from Palestine. While Arabs in Jaffa killed their Jewish neigh bors, the Zionist Maccabi basketball team played against (and was beaten by) the Egyptian Army team. While Jerusalem was being rent asunder by the Arab‐Jewish conflict, the Tel Aviv Philhar monic Orchestra played under the baton of Arturo Toscanini to enthusiastic Egyptian crowds. And in June, 1945, when two young Palestinian Jews were sentenced to death for assassinating Lord Moyne, the British High Commission er, young Egyptians staged spontaneous demonstrations for the condemned. It was only in 1948 that Egypt became involved in the Arab‐Jewish dispute. King Farouk, motivated by inter Arab rivalry, ordered his forces to grab part of Pales tine. This was the unfortunate miscalculation which put an end to Egypt's neutrality. The rest is sad history. As a buf fer zone, Sinai would help turn the clock back and nor malize the relationship be tween two countries which have no inherent conflict of interests. the quiet canal, above the gun emplacements, the rocket sites and the khaki clad men on both sides, Soviet and American satellites circle, unseen and unheard. They send back to earth photos of what must be the most photo graphed part of the earth. Be cause of the usually cloudless weather, the photographs are extremely clear, and when en larged show the minutest de tail: a new Sam Ⅲ site, a fresh Israeli dugout. The satel lites also send back clear map like photos of the whole area. There, seen from 200 miles above, are the lush green Nile Valley, the narrow blue ribbon of the canal, the vast yellow ness of Sinai, melting in the north into the man‐made greenness which is modern Is rael. Sinai, seen by satellite, is a yellow blotch dividing the two green civilizations, that of the Jordan and that of the Nile. The desert of Sinai, seen from this vantage point, was destined by nature to separate the two. It is in cumbent on men of good will to help nature fulfill this role.

By Laura Z. Hobson. 286 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $6.95. You are Dori Gray, 40, divorced and unable to have a baby. Until old Mother Nature heals the after effects of a clumsy curettage—and presto chango, you are more than slightly pregnant. By a married lover whom you don't care to marry. And you nave in the meantime taken on a lover who won't marry you. You can see from these sparse details that Laura Z. Hobson (known to a host of readers for another problem novel, “Gentleman's Agreement”) has cooked up a fine kettle of fish for her unmarried‐mother‐to‐be. Dori is not one of those women whose problems can be solved by a 24‐hour child day‐care center, and she doesn't want another abortion either, thank you. You'd never believe how she works things out. I still can't believe it myself.

420-> On. TV: Five Photographers
Photography AT one point in Alcoa's television special “The Photographers,” to be shown tonight at 7 on Channel 5, Life photographer John Dominis turns to his guide in the wilds of Idaho and says, with pleased dis belief, “I'm getting paid for this.” “Oh, you are?” says the guide. “Yes,” says Domi nis. “Well, you got a racket, haven't you?” says the guide. I felt he had a point. To photograph bighorn sheep for Life, Dominis went into the wilderness with enough equipment to fly to the moon and back. Or so it seemed. Motorized cameras, remote controlled cameras, lenses that focus down to half an inch. You name it, he had it. If only those cameras could walk around by themselves, I thought, they wouldn't need Dominis at all, and he could devote himself to the ambi ance. ('I go to these inter esting places, and I'm so busy working with the equipment and looking through the find er that I don't see the gen eral ambiance of the place,” he says). Well of course, I was wrong to think such a dread ful thought. We have all seen Dominis's fascinating pic tures of the big cats of Afri ca, and we know that he has done something special that we could not do with twice as much equipment. But it is a funny thing about this smoothly crafted, fast‐moving television documentary. I kept feeling that somebody's tail was being tweaked. I'm not sure whose. The producer, Christine Huneke, made it for Time‐Life Films, which put up the money, so she could not be making fun of Life. It was more like the whole corps of professional photog raphers was being given a gentle going‐over. Or perhaps that finger was meant for the public—you and me—who devour the works of profes sional photographers in such quantity and so uncritically. The show opens with vet eran Life photographer Al fred Eisenstadt photograph ing Sally “Hot Lips” Keller man on a deserted beach in Southern California. In a manic sequence worthy of Fatty Arbuckle and Buster Keaton, sexy Sally in her tiny white bikini writhes and moans all by herself on the beach while Eisie, an eager little dumpling of a man, rushes to and fro with his camera like a fussy little duckling in a mating dance with a stork. At one point he comes too close and Sally smiles a steely smile and says “Don't try to touch me'— as if she were a Bunny at the Playboy Club. The next and least point ed segment shows freelance photographer Mary Ellen Mark photographing Algeria for Paris‐Match. She wants to be inconspicuous in order to catch her subjects una ware, but it's hard for a girl to be inconspicuous when she is wearing a miniskirt in Al giers. Then comes British fashion photographer Norman Parkin son shooting a fashion spread for Vogue. Parkinson drives around Rome in a low‐slung white convertible and wears a kind of harem garb when he works. He calls everybody “darling” and is surrounded by flatterers and flunkies. Ex cept for his age, he is the very model of the pho tographic pasha that Antoni oni took off so well in “Blow Up,” and his photographs have all the unctuous bravura that makes reading Vogue such a mitigated delight. The narrator is most re spectful of Parkinson: “Unlike the photo‐journalist, he con trols what he photographs— and he creates.” Parkinson agrees. “It's vital for me to show women not what they do look like but what they might look like.” True enough, that is what a fash ion photographer does, and it is easy to make fun of his artistic pretensions and excesses of personal be havior. But in fact it is a relief to meet a photograph er who deals in make‐believe so frankly and openly. It is a relief, because each of the other photographers in this show is also involved, to some degree in make‐believe, though not so openly as Par kinson. Perhaps there is least make believe in the pictures of John Dominis because ani mals, although disturbed by the camera's click and the presence of man, at least do not know they are being photographed. Human beings do, and that creates prob lems for the photographer. In this show, Eisenstadt solves them by frankly stag ing the scenes of Miss Kel lerman's life that show up looking spontaneous in the pages of Life. Miss Kellerman is an actress, so it works. Mary Ellen Marks tries to catch life on the wing, but winds up staging it too, even in the streets of the Casbah. This works too, for the pur poses of Paris‐Match. And then there is Larry Burrows in Vietnam. The last and longest segment of “The Photographers” is devoted to the shooting of a story by Burrows that appeared in last week's Life. It is the story of a small Vietnamese boy, crippled by war, who learns to speak English and to love his adoptive Ameri can family while receiving special medical treatment in the United States, then is sent back to his real family in Vietnam whose language he has half forgotten and who are quite unable to give him the kind of care and treatment he cannot now do without. Everyone, including his parents, realizes that the best thing for him would be to return to America for good. The boy even asks Burrows to take him to live with him. But due to the mysterious workings of worthy charitable organiza tions, the obvious and hu mane solution is not to be. and this segment of the TV program ends with the sug gestion that war is hell. Needless to say this story was not make‐believe, but photographer Burrows was there, and throughout the TV film we see him taking a part which does not show up in the pages of Life. Not only was he there, gently but insistently questioning the boy for the benefit of the television audience, and promising to come back and see him again, but there was also a three‐man television camera crew photographing him as he questioned and photographed the boy. He believes, of course, that the boy does not notice all this. “Eventually he accepts you as being part of the scene, and therefore, he does things in a natural way.” And in deed, when you look at the story in Life, it seems that he has. The TV documentary “The Photographers” is a superior example of what the tel evision industry means by an information program. In showing how professional photographers go about their work it does indeed reveal a great deal that will probably surprise many and perhaps shock some. But it does this in such a smooth and seam less way that the significance of these revelations could easily be lost. This is perhaps the pro gram's most serious failing, one it shares with most of the mass media, including the big picture magazines. So neatly joined are its various elements, so carefully man aged its shifts of mood and tone, that it is hard to know whether “The Photographers” is meant as a serious criticism of professional photographers and their audience, or if it is merely intended to fill up the time between com mercials in as interesting and agreeable a manner as pos sible. New Yorkers can judge for themselves tonight on WNEW‐TV, Channel 5. The program will be repeated on Thursday at 10 P.M. on WOR‐TV. Out‐of‐towners should consult their local listings for time and station.

421-> City Notes Unemployment Rise, But Looks for Economic Growth
New York City has begun to feel the squeeze of the national recession, the city's Economic Development Administrator said yesterday. But he held that an office construction boom and an increased industrial park program would ease the city's problems. Ken Patton, the Administra tor, said November saw the “first drop‐off in actual employ men that we've had in four and a half years.” The city's 1970 unemployment rate was 4.6 per cent, he said, compared with 3.3 during 1969. But the jobless rate was still a full point below the nation's, he said, and less than the 6 and 7 per cent in Nassau County and parts of New Jersey. Mr. Patton gave his views during a WOR‐TV “New York Report” interview and then a “With Mayor Lindsay” broad cast on WNEW‐TV. Some Pluses Noted On the plus side, Mr. Patton said: ¶Nonresidential construction has “boomed in the past two and a half years,” with 25 per cent of the nation's office build ing under way in the city. Of fice vacancies here have risen from 1 per cent during 1964‐69 to 6 per cent. This is mainly an effect of stock‐market declines, and it allows “maneuver ability.” ¶Loss of manufacturing jobs in the city accelerated during 1970, with the national eco nomic downturn and imports hurting some industries, but the city government has built up a supply of 680 acres of space for lease in industrial parks. The city is “beginning to place industry in significant numbers” in those parks. ¶Jobs in the former Brook lyn Navy Yard have risen above 2,000, with “serious de velopment” under way only since the city obtained title last summer. This is “behind sched ule,” but the new jobs are “almost exclusively targeted at the Central Brooklyn commu nity” and at men—“very im portant from a social, stand point.” New Businesses Listed The city has had “a number of significant move‐ins” in both corporate headquarters and manufacturing, Mr. Patton said. He listed Norton Simon as a major conglomerate com ing here from California in “in ternationalization of its busi ness”; the United Match Com pany from St. Louis, and At lantic Richfield, from Philadel phia and Los Angeles. In commercial efforts, Mr. Patton said the city was “cre ating new downtown areas in Brooklyn and Jamaica.” Last Nov. 9, Mr. Patton ap peared as a witness in Bed minster, N. J., to argue against zoning charges sought by the Western Electric Company to open a new office complex there. Yesterday he stressed that Western Electric had not been planning to leave the city and that his opposition had been based on lack of mass transit and the presence of five‐acre zoning, making it difficult for poor people to get jobs there. Since then, he said, four suburban communities have “turned down major campus type zoning.” He listed these as Bedminster, North Castle and Pound Ridge in New York and part of Greenwich in Connecti cut. Noting the suburban com munities need for tax ratables, Mr. Patton argued that “if we had revenue‐sharing, if money was flowing back to communi ties, then they would allow industries and offices to be cen tered into clusters, as they belong.”

422-> 100,000 Jobs for Veterans Goal Of Appeal of a Business Group
WASHINGTON, June 22— The Nixon Administration will announce tomorrow a pledge by the National Alliance of Busi nessmen, a group of volunteer business executives, to seek out at least 100,000 jobs over the next 12 months for Vietnam veterans. The plan is the latest step by the Administration to im prove the lot of hundreds of thousands of veterans who have been returning home since 1964 and finding numerous obstacles to re‐entering civilian society. Tomorrow's announcement will come less than two weeks after President Nixon expressed in a letter to Secretary of Labor James D. Hodgson his deep concern at the “denial of civilian job opportunities to these young men who have borne the burden of the fight ing” in Vietnam. In the letter, Mr. Nixon di rected Mr. Hodgson to ask the assistance of the business group in solving the problem. The group, which is headed by 17 high‐level corporate execu tives who work as volunteers, was formed by President John son in 1968 to solicit jobs from industry for hard‐core un employables. Since last July, the group, which is currently headed by John D. Harper, chairman of the board of the Aluminum Company of America, has found jobs for more than 200, 000 persons, most of whom lacked the skills and education to enable them to find jobs on their own. The organization does not provide the jobs but secures commitments from business and industry through its members in 150 communities. The unemployment problem of Vietnam veterans is more acute than that of their civilian counterparts. Few of the vet erans, especially the infantry men, bring back skills from military service that make them attractive to employers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, for example, that the unemployment, rate last month among veterans in the 20‐to‐29‐year age group was 10.7 per cent, compare to 7.0 per cent among all males in that age group. The problem is even more severe for black veterans, 15.1 per cent of whom were unem ployed compared to 9.3 per cent of all black males of the same age. Of the five million men who have been released from mili tary service since 1964, about 1.6‐million have entered college upon their return, and some 90 per cent of the rest or about 3‐million, have been able to find jobs. The unemployment problem, which the Administration hopes the business group can help to alleviate, is, largely confined to an estimated “hard core” of 375,000 to 400,000 veterans. Spokesmen for the business men said that they would not comment on the program until after it was officially announced tomorrow, but one official of the group said that he thought the proposed target of 100,000 jobs, even though far less than half the total that will eventual ly be required was “way too high” to be realistic. He noted that the business organization was having diffi culty finding summer jobs for teen‐agers and that of 150,000 such jobs it had pledged to lo cate, only 100,000 had been found. The downturn in the economy has made it difficult for many civilians, even some with col lege degrees, to find work. The current nationwide unemploy ment rate is 6.2 per cent, the highest in nine years.

423-> The Voice of Youth
The planners of the White House Conference on Youth were aware of President Nixon's dislike for dissident demonstrations. They therefore wanted young Americans to be heard—but not too loudly, That is why they took the 1,500 delegates to the mountains of Estes Park, Colorado—out of sight and earshot of sensitive Washing ton. What started as a policy of caution was turned into a virtual parody of maximum security through isolation, when nature dumped masses of snow on the meeting. Aside from the physical precautions, the conference was clearly planned to give the youth sector of the Silent Majority the lion's share of the representation. The voices of Middle‐America and the South were assured a volume that would preclude domination by the Eastern “estab lishment.” The non‐white minorities were given an extensive representation to make it evident that they were not riding on the coattails of white middle.class radicals. It is therefore of extraordinary significance that this deliberately non‐radical composite of American youth, who emphatically rejected initial efforts by a few radical interlopers to take over the conference, sent to Washing ton an eloquent message of concern about the nation's present course. These youths of mainstream America have implored President Nixon to end the war in Indo china—not by Vietnamizing the fighting but by stopping the bloodshed and bringing the troops and the prisoners home. One need not agree with all the conference recommen dations nor accept the obvious oversimplifications. But it would be callous as well as politically suicidal not heed the anguished call for leadership of courage and hope, rather than of expediency and fear. Young Ameri cans have not—as the radical fringe sometimes pro claims—given up on the representative system of gov ernment or on the promise of the American dream. They plead instead—as they did in the preamble of their report—for a leadership that uhderstands that the young are “motivated not by hatred, but by the disappointment over and love for the unfulfilled potential of this nation.” This cry from the heart calls out for an honest, com passionate response.

424-> Common Stock Is Offered By Northern Illinois Gas
The Northern Illinois Gas Company is offering 900,000 shares of its common stock to the public at 32⅞ a share, it was announced yesterday by an underwriting group that had won the award of the shares on its bid of $32.095 a share. Proceeds of the sale of the additional common shares will be used by the utility to increase working capital available for construction purposes. Another offering was 750,000 shares of Atlantic City Electric Company's common stock at $23.75 a share. Net proceeds from this sale and from a proposed forthcoming sale of $27million first mortgage bonds will be used to the extent necessary to prepay outstanding bank notes, which totaled $30million on April 1, 1971.

425-> ALLIED CHEMICAL LIFTS NYLON PRICE
The Allied Chemical Corporation announced yesterday that it was raising prices on all fine denier filament nylon yarns by an average of 8 per cent, effective immediately. The company said the increase would affect knit, feeder, hosiery and weaving yarns. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, Inc., the largest nylon producer, said that it had increased “some” nylon filament prices in recent weeks and “will continue to try to get them in line where we believe they should be.” A spokesman for the Monsanto Company, another major producer, said the price increases were not unexpected in view of the firmer nylon supply‐demand situation. “Monsanto will be adjusting upward prices for a number of nylon apparel denier yarns and will be communicating these shortly to its customers,” said Eric Sharp, assistant general manager of the company's textile division. Market sources attributed the price increases to an attempt by industry to get closer to list prices. Inventories have been depleted in the apparel area, and the scheduled capacity alone cannot meet demand, these sources said. In other price moves, the Atlantic Richfield Company announced a nationwide reduction of one cent a gallon in the wholesale price to dealers of unleaded gasoline, effective today.

426-> SST Is Alive and Well in Europe
Congress has, for the time being at least, grounded the American SST. It had concrete concerns about the SST, both ecological—that it might threaten the environment; and economic—that it might tax instead of benefit the people. But the SST and the issues it has fomented remain with us. Indeed, the SST is alive and flying in England, France and the Soviet Union, and will soon be offered, on the world markets. So this is a time neither for gloat ing, as though the SST had vanished; nor for grieving, as though the SST had vanished. It is a time for measured reflection. To face our responsibility to the future and to assure that whichever SST takes the eventual and inevitable dominant place in the world's long range air fleets will be a sound and welcome one, I propose a two‐part program. First, that an international forum be convened to reach agreement on real istic airworthiness, safety and ecolog ical standards for supersonic commer cial flight, and to pool technology to meet such standards. Second, that the airlines conduct thorough “fly before buy” program of concentrated SST testing under actual airline conditions, to assure that any SST meets all these requirements— plus economic requirements — before being considered acceptable for com mercial service. (These proposals were first broached in a personal letter which I sent to Secretary of Transportation John A. Volpe on March 4, 1971.) Setting the safety, efficiency and environmental standards for an SST is obviously beyond the province of single nation, because the SST will affect many nations. And developing a machine to meet these exacting standards may also prove beyond the capability of a single nation. Many local and highly vocal con stituencies have proposed neighbor hood noise laws to bar SST's from their airports. Aside from the dubious constitutionality of addressing local legislation to international problems, it must be patently preferable to es tablish uniform standards acceptable to all the neighborhods of the world, and in fairness applicable to every new airplane, whether propeller, jet, SST, or nuclear‐powered, for that matter. The same logic applies even more strongly to concern about harm to the atmosphere, since the world is a uni fied organic system, and the air that swirls over Siberia today may fill the ‐ California skies tomorrow. The United States should take the initiative in calling for such an inter national conference on supersonic flight. The nucleus might be the four nations already involved in SST tech nology, and an international agency like the U.N.'s Atomic Energy Agency, staffed by scientists and engineers of many nations, might grow from this nucleus. The agency would espouse the prin ciple of technological togetherness that has already enriched the world by sharing research and knowledge in outer space, in medicine, in the peace ful uses of atomic energy. The second aspect of my proposal is that even after an SST passes the muster of the international group, undergo thorough prolonged tests un der actual airline conditions. It is one thing for a factory test pilot to put a new bird through its paces, to run it past all the red lines, to overload it, overstress it, subject it to abuse far more brutal than it will ever see in commercial service, and then to pronounce it sound. It is quite another thing to fly back and forth across the ocean every day on sched ule in a new airplane. We want, in effect, to take an ad vanced airplane and turn it into routine transport, a completely familiar vehicle with no surprises or mysteries for crew, passengers, or society, and we want to accomplish this before we invite paying passengers aboard. We know that worldwide supersonic flight will become as commonplace in the decades ahead as jet travel is today. And we know that Congress in voting against the American SST re flected the honest and strong reserva tions of a cautious citizenry. The program I propose is a respon sible one for reconciling the progress that is certain, and the caution that is essential.

427-> Portents From West Berlin
Many West Berliners deserted Chancellor Brandt's So cial Democrats in their city election because they feared the effects on their own security of his effort to improve relations with the Soviet bloc. The opposition Christian Democrats had played heavily on this concern, and Mr. Brandt had accepted their bid to make the election a referendum on his Ostpolitik. Nevertheless, the Social Democrats did emerge with an absolute majority in both the popular vote and the West Berlin Parliament. Thus the results, disappointing as they must have been for Mr. Brandt, will not derail his Eastern policy. Even the Christian Democrats, making their best postwar showing in West Berlin with 38.2 per cent of the vote, did not demand complete reversal of the Ostpolitik. They contended they would drive harder bargains with the Soviets and forge an Eastern policy involving fewer risks for Germany. It would be healthy if the Berlin results did put a damper on certain Brandt advisers who exuded undue optimism about an early Berlin settlement. It would be even better if the evident fear of many Germans that Chancellor Brandt may already have made too many con cessions to the U.S.S.R. would prompt the Soviet Union to come forward at last with the guarantees that could resolve the Berlin problem and produce a major advance toward genuine détente and peace in Central Europe.

428-> The Sourdoughs Have Vanished, but Sour Doughs Live On
TALKEETNA, Alaska — Occasionally a food is so distinctive that it gives its name to an entire subculture. In London there are the Beefeaters and in Southern California the lotus eaters. In Alaska there were the sourdoughs, the itinerant prospectors who roamed this vast and hostile territory looking for gold. There are not many true sourdoughs left, but the food they made famous has survived. One of the great practitioners of tra ditional sour dough cookery is Alice Powell, proprietor of the Talkeetna Mo tel, raconteur, bear hunter, miner, and former brothel inspector. Her blueberry sour dough hot cakes have lured people from miles away to this tiny town 125 miles north of Anchorage. A small woman who wears white pants suits and a veneer of toughness, Mrs. Powell talked about sour dough one recent morning over coffee in her de serted dining room. The snow was 5 feet deep outside, and the moose — let alone human travelers — were having trouble getting through. The legend of sour dough is based on the need for a “starter,” a portion of fermented dough that contains the essence of the sourness. A starter is always saved from each batch. “In the morning when they were out on the trail, the old‐timers would add flour to their starter and make it into a ball,” Mrs. Powell said in a voice like cracking peanut shells. “Then they would wrap it up and put it inside their shirt to keep it warm. When they stopped at night, they put in the water and the batter was ready in the morning.” Mrs. Powell's modern version calls for mixing the flour and water with the starter at night. The next morning, after saving a new starter, she adds eggs, sugar, salt, cooking oil and baking soda. Then she grills the hot cakes. Being a real “sourdough,” however, involves more than gastronomy. “The legend is that you have to sleep with a squaw and rassle a bear,” Mrs. Powell said with a laugh. “Then you're a sour dough.” Another legend says that you must be given a sour dough starter. “My original starter came from an old man who said he was 80 years old, but I think he was a liar,” she cracked. Mrs. Powell's own starter is now about 15 years old, but she debunks the legend. “I can make one in 48 hours,” she said. “All it takes is flour, water, sugar and yeast. You can tell it's ripe by the smell.” Still, sour dough starter makes a nice present, and Mrs. Powell‐saves glass jars to give it to friends. For some rea son, metal ruins the dough, and she sug gests it be kept in an earthen crock. The origins of sour dough are ob scure. Mrs. Powell thinks it might have come from France, but she remembers that her grandmother used to cook “sour milk” pancakes back in Vermont. Another theory is that the Russians who originally colonized Alaska brought va rious sour milk and cream dishes with them. During the busy season, Mrs. Powell cooks hot cakes every morning and us ually adds wild blueberries. Berry pick ing is a favorite pastime in Alaska, but she has her own system. Helicopter pi lots from local military installations often land in her backyard, and, in ex change for a few drinks, they take her out to the more remote berry patches. Mrs. Powell, makes the whole thing sound easy, but it isn't. A New York chef who was preparing a cookbook re cently could not get the sour dough right and offered to fly her south and east to help out. Finally he settled for a detailed telephone explanation. A food processor wants her to pack age her sour dough starter, along with some other pet recipes. She is not sure if it would work, but if she sells the motel she might try. Alice Powell never wanted to run a motel anyway. Now 63, she came to Alaska in 1947, when her husband got a job building the Alaskan railroad. She worked for Anchorage as a health in spector, and her territory included the local bordellos. Her strictness earned her the nickname “Evil Alice.” After five years, she “retired” to a homestead near Talkeetna, which at the time could be reached only by rail road. Nevertheless, she soon found her self innundated with friends and friends of friends looking for free room and board while hunting and fishing in the area. Eleven years ago, in self‐defense, she opened the motel. “Most of those people I gave free meals to have not been back as paying customers,” she said. Mrs. Powell likes to cook and is a de lightful bartender, but her real love is mining. She and her husband, who is often away on construction jobs, leased a few claims several years ago, but nothing came of them. Recently she heard stories of a large silver deposit in the vicinity, and her eyes blaze when she talks about it. At heart, Alice Powell is a real sourdough.

429-> Economic Crisis Casts Doubt On Future of WNYC Stations
The future of New York City's radio stations, WNYC and WNYC‐FM, and the municipal television outlet, WNYCTV, are in doubt because of the city's economic crisis. Milton Musicus, administrator of the Municipal Service Administration, said yesterday that consideration was being given to closing down the outlets, weighing the legal complications attendant to holding licenses from the Federal Communications Commission or finding a possible buyer. Until all aspects of the problem had been carefully studied, Mr. Musicus said, the city could not reach a decision but from other sources it was predicted the days of the outlets were numbered. $Z.2‐Million Budget The Office of Communications, of which the Municipal Broadcasting System is a part, has been operating on a budget of $2.2‐million, involving 165 jobs. In addition to radio and TV broadcasting, the office operates and maintains twoway radio services for 18 city agencies. The cost of TV and radio broadcasting is around $1,315,000. With the city facing the shutdown of eight hospitals, elimination this summer of airconditioning in oity offices and use of lower‐wattage bulbs, Mr. Musicus said the estentialitY of the city's broadcasting operations inevitably would come under review. Ethan A. Hitchcock, chairman of the Educational Broadcasting Corporation, some time ago approached the city with a proposal for linking together Channel 13 and the city's ultra high frequency TV station on Channel 31. Mr. Musicus said the city was awaiting a more definitive account of what Channel 13 might have in mind. The corporation itself has tight budget problems. Were the City of New York voluntarily to return its license to the agency there would be an automatic loss of revenue from the sale and newcomers could apply for the channels. Mr. Musicus further noted that the Office of Communications performs many technical chores for the city, such as running the public‐address system in the Board of Estimate, and the cost of these services would have to be weighed before a decision. Scores of Competitors WNYC, which first went on the air in 1924, initially had a virtual monopoly on classical music without commercial interruptions but in recent years, particularly on the FM band, has had scores of competitors rendering much the same service. WNYC‐TV, which started in 1961, has labored under a minuscule budget by TV standards and suffered the further disadvantage of being an ultra high frequency station when not too many UT‐IF sets were in service. Talk of the sale of the WNYC outlets has arisen periodically during city budget crises but the present time is not regarded as the most auspicious moment for such a venture. The National Broadcasting Company wants to dispose of its radio outlets and The New York Times has said WQXR and WQXR‐FM are on the market if the right purchaser comes along. With so many AM and FM stations suddenly thrown on the market a buyer would have the upper hand, according to station brokers. A consideration for the city is that if it disposes of its licenses the municipality is not likely to have a second chance to regain such facilities in the electronic age. The city holds commercial broadcast licenses, which make their facilities easier to sell, but voluntarily banned advertising. FM station WRVR, owned by the Riverside Church, recently announced a change of policy allowing acceptance of advertising because of mounting costs.

430-> SAVINGS BANK BILL IN CONNECTICUT GAIN
The Connecticut Legislature, in a move that has national significance, has moved a step closer to giving mutual savings banks in that state a limited authorization to offer checking accounts to their depositors. Similar measures are pending in several other New England states, and on a national level the Presidential Commission on Financial Structure and Regulation is considering whether all thrift institutions should have this authority. Under the Connecticut bill—which was voted out of committee this week—saving banks in all but a few small towns will be allowed to accept checking accounts. Eighty‐seven per cent of the funds received will have to be redeposited in interest‐bearing accounts at Connecticut commercial banks with less than $50‐million in total deposits. The remaining 13 per cent will go into demand deposits at major banks in the state. Bankers said yesterday that there was no assurance that the bill would pass the full legislature.

431-> LINDSAY CONCEDES LABOR'S HOSTILITY
Mayor Lindsay, who has presided over sonic of the most costly settlements to municipal unions in the city's history, conceded early yesterday that ninny labor leaders were hostile to him. “It's all uphill; we're starting from ground zero,” the Mayor said in an impromptu interview en route home after his appearance at a labor dinner in Canton, Ohio. The Mayor was warmly received at the dinner, particularly by women who, regardless of age, lined up for autographs and in general reacted to the Mayor as if he were a matinee idol. The subject of the adulation. Mr. Lindsay, said that he was pleased with what he referred to as his first “test” of labor reaction to him since he changed parties and began an unofficial bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination. But more politically significant than his warm reception by women in the Canton audience was the fact that several Ohio labor leaders at the dinner privately expressed doubt that he could be the Presidential nominee. They cited attacks on him by George Meany, president of the American Federation of Labor and. Congress of Industrial Organizations, and Mr. Lindsay's new status as a Democrat. “He should wait in line just like I waited my turn,” said one top Ohio labor leader. Mr. Lindsay said that he had no plans to meet with Mr. Meany, who has said several times that he would support President Nixon If Mr. Lindsay were the Democratic Presidential nominee. The Meany attacks have been interpreted by some politicians as a virtual veto of Mr. Lindsay's candidacy by one of the most powerful figures in the Democratic party. Asked if he had any other plans to woo labor support, the Mayor shrugged his shoulders and said: “We'll see what develops.” He attributed at least some of his labor troubles to Harry Van Ardsdale Jr., president of the city's Central Labor Council. Mr. Lindsay noted that he was a “politically independent” mayor and that there had been labor resistance to his efforts to “open up the unions to minority groups.” He emphasized that much of the antipathy of Mr. Van Arsdale had been “dissipated.” However, Mr. Van Arsdale, who was unavailable for comment, has far less influence in the Lindsay administration than he had under former Mayor Robert F. Wagner. He was one of Mr. Wagner's closest confidants. One labor leader who has been considered fairly close to the Mayor said that Mr. Lindsay's major problem was failure “to communicate” with labor leaders in the city. Victor Gotbaum, president of District Council 37 of the State, County and Municipal Employes Union, said: “Meany isn't his problem. Lindsay hasn't taken time to talk to people, that's his prob. lem.” When people say I'm the labor leader closest to him, tell them that maybe they're right—I spoke to him at least once this year.” Asked about the city's settlements with municipal unions, Mr. Gotbaum said his union “has no problem with the Mayor as a boss.” But, he added, “this isn't a sine qua non for the Presidency.” Lindsay aides are drawing up a detailed memorandum on the Mayor's labor record in an attempt to dispel some of the labor antagonism to him.

432-> Irish Are in Luck: Mild Day Forecast For Parade Today
The man at the National Weather Service office here, usually a taciturn type, said yesterday with a smile that to day's weather would be sunny, breezy and mild, with tempera tures in the 50's. Relentless questioning also disclosed that his name was James Patrick Haughey, that he was a meteorologist and Irish and that he believed all the Irish deserved as fine as yesterday's 69 degrees for the 209th annual St. Patrick's Day Parade up Fifth Avenue today. The parade is to start at noon from 44th Street and will proceed to 86th Street with 120,000 marchers in 345 con tingents taking part, according to spokesmen for the sponsor, the Ancient Order of Hiberni ans. And, it was said, 180 bands from eight states will provide the marching music. Leading the parade will be the grand marshal, Patrick J. Grimes, publisher of the Irish, American weekly newspaper The Irish Echo. He will be fol lowed by Mayor Lindsay and the pipers band of the Police Department's Emerald Society. The Mayor will march to the reviewing stand at 64th Street where it is expected that he will be joined by Governor Rockefeller, City Council Presi dent Sanford D. Garelik, former Mayor. Robert F. Wagner, Gov. Thomas J. Meskill of Connecti cut, Gov. William T. Cahill o New Jersey, William Warnock Irish Ambassador to the United States, and other dignitaries Cardinal Cooke will ?? his honorary grand ?? ?? on the steps of St. Pat rick's Cathedral at 11:45 A.M.

433-> Wanamaker, Jenner 1, 2 In the Decathlon at Drake
DES MOINES, Iowa, April 22 (AP)—Rick Wanamaker, former Drake University stand out, won two events today and captured the decathlon at the 62d Drake Relays with 7.693 points. Bruce Jenner of Graceland College, the Kansas Relays champion, finished second with 7,402 and Fred Samara of Penn sylvania was third with 7,208. Wanamaker threw the jave lin 207 feet ½ inch and the discus 139‐5 for his first places.

434-> Giants Rout Chargers, 35‐17
Fine work by both units, their recently strengthened offense and recently realigned defense, brought the New York Giants a 35‐17 victory over San Diego at Yankee Stadium yesterday, and ended their four‐game losing streak. An injury to Ron Johnson's left knee, forcing him out of action early in the fourth quarter, cast a shadow on the only decisive Giant triumph of the season. But the postgame medical report (a sprain with liossible ligament damage) indicated he might be all right in time for the next game. Before he left, Johnson shared the offensive spotlight with a razor‐sharp Fran Tarkenton and two rookies, Charlie Evans and Coleman Zeno. Behind a strong performance by the offensive line, they led an attack that netted 417 yards. Evans scored three of the five touchdowns before 62,905 fans. The defense, meanwhile, contained San Diego's high‐powered passing game for all but the third quarter. Two key contributions were interceptions, one by Spider Lockhart to end a thrust toward the first score of the game, and one by Willie Williams to set up the final touchdown with 5 minutes 19 seconds to play. What's more, the Giants showed la quality that football people extol by being tough when a threat did develop. Off to a 21‐0 lead, they yielded a field goal in the last two seconds of the first half, and two touchdowns in the first 11 minutes after intermission. But with only a 21‐17 lead and 19 minutes to play, they controlled the ball for 14 of those, scored two more touchdowns and yielded only one first down while it still counted. All of which left the Giants with a 3–5 won‐lost record and a tie with St. Louis for third place in the Eastern Division. Johnson, whose presence Makes New York's attack go, gained 67 yards on 12 carries. He has played only six quarters, and has gained 156 yards rushing. Bobby Duhon, the team leader, who played all of the first six games and the last quarter yesterday, has 193. Tarkenton completed 16 of his 20 passes, and reached a career milestone. Just before half‐time, he hit Dick Kotite for a 43‐yard scoring play, and that was the 212th touchdown pass of his career. Only three men have thrown more—Johnny Unitas, 280; Sonny Jurgensen, 236, and George Blanda, 232—and Y.A. Tittle also had 212. Only 31 years old, Tarkenton may yet surpass them all. Evans and Zeno, however, have their careers ahead of them. Zeno was officially activated only yesterday morning, because the Giants had dropped Reggie Rucker last Tuesday and because Don Herrmann's shoulder was still sore. A 17th‐round draft choice who caught three touchdown passes during the exhibition season, Zeno has been on the taxi squad since then, a highlyregarded but inexperienced prospect. At Grambling, he played second‐string to Frank Lewis, the No. 1 draft pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Herrmann did start, but Zeno replaced him early in the first touchdown drive, and went on to catch four important passes for 90 yards, plus two that didn't count. One was nullified because an ineligible man was downfield, the other because Zeno himself was in motion illegally before catching a 13‐yard toss in the end zone. Later, he made a 53‐yard gain that just missed being a score as he was hauled out of bounds on the 3‐yard line. Evans was chosen In the 14th round of the draft, from Southern California. He also was only a semiregular in college, and more of a blocking back than ball‐carrier. Promoted from the taxi squad four weeks ago when Tucker Frederickson was hurt, he scored the only Giant touchdowns in the Philadelphia and Minnesota games from short range. He pounded over this time from 9 yards out once and 1 yard out twice. He also caught six passes, playing the whole game while Frederickson rested his aggravated hamstring pull. John Hadl, San Diego's passer, was subjected to a strong rush most of the game, and had to hurry many of his throws. He took the Chargers on a 52‐yard, six‐minute march from the opening kickoff to the Giant 22, but Lockhard intercepted on the 4 on first down and ran to the Giant 35.

435-> DISTRICTING STIRS POLITICAL ANXIETY
ALBANY, Dec. 14—The state's lawmakers showed up here today to sec what the masterminds of legislative reapportionment had done to them. What they found was that despite the months of work with computers, the actual bills were not yet ready for them. As they chewed steak sandwiches, tardily served and tough, in a restaurant near the Capitol tonight, some of the legislators joked about the misfortune of colleagues who they heard had been placed in the same district, forcing them to run against each other in primaries or resign. At the Ambassador Restaurant, the Democratic Assembly minority leader, Stanley Steingut, and his deputy, Albert H. Blumenthal, waited calmly until an aide informed them that the bells calling the lower house to sit had begun to ring, shortly before 7:30 P.M. Because of their rank in the minority, neither Mr. Steingut nor Mr. Blumenthal was personally subjected to discomfort by the majority Republican map makers. In the Senate, Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges talked about a number of things during the 20‐minute session—not a word of it about reapportionment The Niagara Falls Republican noted that girl pages now outnumbered male pages in the chamber and suggested that one of the men sit between two of the girls. Mr. Brydges also welcomed two new Senators—George A. Murphy of Nassau and Edmond R. Gold of Queens. The majority leader said that Mr. Gold had replaced Seymour R. Thaler, who “left to run for office of much lower stature.” Mr. Thaler was elected to the State Supreme Court last month. But most of the legislators became diffident, if not annoyed, as the night drew on and the likelihood of their seeing the reapportionment bill waned. “All I'll get out of this one,” said a Long Island Assemblyman, “is the $62 carfare.” Reapportionment is the political act probably least interesting to the public and most important to the politician. For an upstate legislator, it can mean retention or loss of a position that gives him considerable status and power in his home district. In New York City, faithful membership in the Democratic delegation for a number of years can mean the judgeship many of the city lawmakers crave. And it is frustrating to many legislators that they are never in close when the actual lines are drawn. This year the mapmaking was done in a Syracuse law office by a Republicandominated legislative committee staff directed by Richard S. Scolaro and Donald Zimmerman. Among the nonpaid volunteers working on the 22‐foot square maps was Mr. Scolaro's wife Patty, who crawled around on plastic map overlays in an orange pants suit, marking lines with a crayon. The markings were read out and transcribed for hasty dispatch by messenger to the Williams Press in Albany for printing, to meet tonight's deadline for having the plan in bill form on the lawmakers desks. Mr. Zimmerman, who has been the Republican's chief line‐drawing strategist for a decade, was, as usual, publicly silent about his work as he padded about the maps with terry‐cloth slippers covering his shoes. In past reapportionment battles, Mr. Zimmerman's work has been called “Zimmermanders” by annoyed legislators. Some legislators returning here recalled that this was the first special session for reapportionment since December, 1964. At that session a lame‐duck Republican majority, defeated in Lyndon B. Johnson's sweep of the state in the Presidential election, was trying to mapmake itself back into a power in the 1965 special election. The Democrats protested in agony and tried to draw their own plan when they took control, but they had troubles. These included a computer that somehow kept making districts in Manhattan run east to west across Central Park, combining Democratic and Republican strongholds, with the zoo in between. The abortive 1965 attempt at reapportionment was done by a group called “The Professors Committee,” headed by Robert B. McKay, dean of the New York University Law School, who is now chairman of a panel investigating the riot at the Attica Correctional Facility in September. With the Republicans now firmly in control of both houses of the Legislature—and likely to tighten that hold under the present reapportionment plan —the redistricting rule expressed a few years ago by a high G.O.P. official seemed still applicable: “It's just a matter of slicing up the salami—and it's in our hands.”

437-> FOREIGN AFFAIRS
The U.S. Army is in trouble in Indochina, not so much because of difficulties in mastering the new kind of war it has been summoned to fight but because of psychological reper cussions arising from doubts as to the validity or value of its mission. These doubts are more inspired by news from home than by enemy propaganda. A self‐doubting army cannot ever be thoroughly effective. And since American society and the American youth which is the army's human reservoir are themselves riddled with doubts about the nation's mission, the U.S. Army in Southeast Asia has had a gnawing problem Imposed upon it. Obviously the army of any nation, whether conscript, regular or mixed, mirrors that nation's soul. The U.S. Army in Indochina reflects increasing race problems, increasing drug prob lems and increasing discipline prob lems since all these are facets of the contemporary American scene. The trouble is that odd haircuts, relaxed sexual relationships, experi ments with marijuana and LSD and occasional interracial battles in the United States are violently distorted into heightened drug addiction and brutal lack of discipline when trans ported to Southeast Asia. This phenomenon helps explain spreading reports of laxity, the “fragging” of officers, the apparently increasing use of heroin and other signs of sagging morale. Obviously the Army suspects it is fighting a battle the nation doesn't want fought. One cannot accurately conjecture on what ultimate effect this psycho logical condition will have as the Army returns home—which it is doing at an ever‐heightened pace. When the French Army, Which was entirely volunteer or colonial, was driven out of Indochina, its psychological condi tion had a profound effect on France itself. Military intellectuals in the officer corps were infected by the method ology of an enemy trained in the Revolutionary Warfare credo of Mao Tse‐tung. Conspirators among these officers, resentful of Paris govern ments and public opinion which had not supported them, later adapted these Maoist methods in Algeria— although never the Maoist social goals. Their O.A.S. (Secret Army Organ ization) revolt threatened the French state itself. Later Col. Roger Trinquier, one of the military intellectuals, saw a division between popular desires and assigned military tasks and com mented: “Our war aims must be clearly known to the people. They will have to be convinced.” It is this lack of convincing that has so perplexed the American nation. For this reason it is imperative that the Nixon Administration should even once again explain the remaining task expected of the Army and the ultimate goal to which the nation must look in Indochina. Before Dienbienphu General de Gaulle, a critic of the French Indo china war, told me. “For a military solution a new method and a new effort would be required. But France does not want to make that effort.… What is taking place there now is only a prestige war.” The United States is certainly not winding up its Southeast Asian mili tary effort in defeat but cannot claim any clearcut victory. And doubts are inspired by the latter fact in a nation that has hitherto boasted it won every war in which it engaged. Major efforts must be made to induce disappointed returning veterans to avoid engulfment by any mustering. backlash or emotional racial or urban confusions that threaten to crumble prevailing values. In France, for wholly other reasons, the Indochina cauldron cooked inherent discontent into incipi ent civil war. President Nixon Is rearranging the relationship between the American people and their Army by terminating the existing unfair draft system and relying on volunteers. This will remove major resentment against fancied in justice by individuals summoned to fight in wars of which they disap prove. As a concluding footnote one might add, however, that the idea of wholly ending national conscription to suit a temporary mood is unsound. Might it not be wiser to keep the idea of one year's national service for all young sters attaining a certain age, but let ting those who prefer spend their time on nonmilitary projects such as the Peace Corps abroad or antipollu tion or educational work at home? This would insure that the Amer ican people still have the type of army they want but remain subject themselves to the kind of temporary sacrifice any democracy should feel justified in asking of its citizens.

438-> JEWISH STUDENTS IN 5‐DAY SEMINAR
ZIEGLERVILLE, Pa., Sept. 4 —No question was too abstruse or too practical for the group gathered here. Is it possible to interpret the holy books of Judaism in a Marxist way? If a man in the desert has only enough water to keep one person alive, must he give it to his companion? Can the Biblical prohibition against women wearing what pertains to a man be upheld in the slacks climate of unisex? The 280 students — 150 from the United States and 130 from abroad—also seemed comfortable with the title of their five‐day seminar here at Camp Arthur: “Jewing It '32: Encounter in the Month of Elul.” (In the Jewish calendar, this is the month Elul, and the year 5732 begins Sept. 20.) The title was offensive to visitors over the age of 21, which is the average age of the participants. But the students assembled by the World Union of Jewish Students and the North American Jewish Students' Network found it a natural way to affirm Jewish identity and style. “Jewili students now realize that while they were fighting for others' identity, they neglected their own identity,” said Yona Yahav, secretary‐general of the World Union. “With the last pangs of life of the New Left came a vacuum in the Jewish student world,” said Edy Rauch, chairman of the Union. “Now there's a revival of interest in traditional values of Judaism. Some people, have called it a Jewish renaissance.” However, the seminar —whose costs were subsidized by Jewish organizations in Philadelphia—seemed to hark back to ancient Greek rather than Renaissance models. Beneath the shade trees, small groups gathered to discuss their experiences, beliefs and doubts, under the guidance of teachers in their own age group. A dozen students led by Rabbi Saul Berman of Stern College, seated on overturned canoes, sought to reconcile the ancient recognition of capital punishment with the virtually impossible conditions required before sentencing. “In effect, what the rabbis suggest is that there's a validity to capital punishment — certain crimes that merit it,” said Rabbi Berman. “But we as human beings can't take a person's life.” There was an alternative to capital punishment, he suggested. “You're not talking about the cheder?” [strict religious school], asked one member of the group facetiously. On the desert problem, traditional opinion holds that the man with water should drink it himself. Not everyone in Rabbi Berman's group was happy with that, however. The rabbi explained the prohibition of women in men's clothing as an attempt to prevent immorality. He conceded that the Biblical injunction might seem a bit archaic today. Farther up the slope, a student leader suggested to his group that the Talmud question “When will the Messiah come?” could have a Marxist answer: When the locomotive of history brings him. The locomotive of the seminar brought orthodox services for believers, and, for the less traditional, a swinging service complete with dancing atop the mess hall tables. There was even a pick‐up soccer game on the Sabbath, with players crying out instructions in Italian, German and English. David Roskies, a graduate student at Brandeis University, lectured on Jewish life — including the Jewish underworld — in prewar Eastern Europe. “In America, the whole experience of Eastern European Jewry has been so sentimentalized and romanticized that nobody can relate to it intellectually,” he said. Israeli culture, Jews in Islamic culture, the Jewish press, student organizing and Jewish women were discussed in workshops. Ron Finkel, chairman of the Australasia Union of Jewish Students, summed up the seminar as suggesting “Here's a spectrum of Jewish life—see if you can find a niche.”

439-> Mediator's Effort Aids in Calming Camden
CAMDEN, N. J., Aug. 22—At 4:30 A.M. yesterday, an aide of Gov. William T. Cahill telephoned the North Bellmore, L. I., home of Dr. Irving Goldaber, a sociologist noted for mediating community antagonisms in 30 cities. The Governor's aide asked the sociologist if he would come to this bleak city across the Delaware River from Philadelphia to help city officials and the Puerto Rican community out of an impasse. The difficulties began after Puerto Ricans charged that the police had beaten a man, and two nights of burning destruction followed and the Mayor said that “the situation is out of control.” At. 12:30 P.M., a helicopter chartered by the Governor's office picked up Dr. Goldaber at the Republic Airport in Farmingdale, L. I. and flew him to the lawn of the Cherry Hill Inn in suburban Cherry Hill. The 45‐year‐old sociologist then met in a closed session with six Puerto Rican community leaders and four city officials. Four and a half hours later, Mayor Joseph M. Nardi Jr. emerged from the meeting and, in a reversal of his earlier position and against the advice of two of his aides at the meeting announced the suspension of two policemen who had been accused of brutality, although he emphasized that he was not accepting the accuracy of the charges. Last night, Camden was relatively quiet, with the main pacifier obviously being the Mayor's announcement, which was impressed on the Puerto Ricans here by scores of Spanish‐speaking persons who circulated around town after having been granted special exemption from an 8 P.M.‐to‐7 A.M. curfew. After a second meeting of Dr. Goldaber and the same group, for three and a half hours today, Puerto Ricans and officials alike spoke of “consolidating the peace,” and “the start of a dialogue.” Dr. Goldaber left the Cherry Hill Inn for home tonight, without having set foot in Camden. Dr. Goldaber, an adjunct associate professor of sociology at Brooklyn College, is also president of Community Confrontation & Communications Associates, a private organization he helped establish in 1967 in Grand Rapids, Mich., which now employs nine other social scientists who work with various “antagonistic” groups. It was in this role that he was summoned to Camden. In a two‐and‐one‐half‐hourlong interview, Dr. Goldaber explained his thesis and operations, which he stresses are continually evolving, of mollifying “adversary groups which don't get along but which need each other.” It is also a thesis which has been called into practice by city and state governments, police departments, community groups and business organizations in at least four states. One basic tenet of it is that “conflict is generic and ever present in human groups.” Thus, Dr. Goldaber said that while he often did not know “neighborhoods, streets, issues and names in a given situation,” such as in this city, the conflicts remain essentially the same as does his process for dealing with them. The socioligist said that he had a binding agreement with Mayor Nardi not to divulge any of the specific dialogue that went on in the two meetings. He agreed, however, to discuss his method in general terms. Dr. Goldaber and his associates insist on various “ground rules” before they undertake what he calls, with a proprietory note, “the laboratory confrontation.” He requires that the adversary groups each have the same number of participants, with each member selected by his own group and with “a cross‐section of the community hostility” represented. Also, each participant must be in a “leadership position” that is not only a choice of particular group, but also able to influence that group as opposed to a popular figurehead. And he further requires that the participants agree to stay in the meeting for the duration of an agreed‐upon time.

440-> Militant Youths Are Old in Fight on War
Many of the 25 people arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in two separate incidents in Buffalo and Camden, N.J., are young. But many of them, despite their youth, are already long‐time members of the antiwar movement. For them, the movement is a fulltime commitment. The oldest of them was John Peter Grady, 46 years old, of the Bronx, descrrbed by a friend as “probably the most lovable guy in the world—a great big curly‐headed Irishman from the Bronx with a laugh you can hear to Chicago.” Mr. Grady, more importantly, was also said to have “spent most of his life working for causes for social change.” Married, and with five children, he has a master's degree in sociology, and at one time reportedly taught sociology at Fordham. University. He has also worked with action groups in Harlem, and was active in antiwar politics in 1968. Book Distributor Involved He was a co‐chairman of the Catonsville Nine Defense Committee, and more recently had been running Resistance Book Distributors, handling books by the Berrigan brothers and other movement writers. Several others among those arrested yesterday, including Rosemary —known as Ro‐Ro—Reilly, 22, and Kathleen M. Ridolfi, 22, were also involved with the book‐distributing group. The only one of the 25 who was a member of the East Coast Conspirancy to Save Lives was the Rev. Peter D. Fordi, a 34‐year‐old Jesuit, priest from Jersey City who lived at 220 West 98th Street, New York City. The East Coast Conspiracy is a group of 11 antiwar activists who acknowledged responsibility for the destruction of draft files in contracts ih Washington, in February, 1970. Father Fordi was also active in the leadership of the Harrisburg 13 Defense Committee, organized in support of the 13, persons indicted with the Rev. Philip Berrigan on conspirancy charges. Described as friendly and casual both in manner and dress—“I've never seen him in a tie” let alone in clerical collar, one associate said — Father Fordi went to St. Peter's, Jesuit preparatory school in Jersey City, then to Seton Hall and from there to the Jesuit seminary in Plattsburgh, N.Y. He was ordained two years ago. Since February, 1970, Father Fordi had been a spokesman for the movement, living in the building where many other members of the Jesuit community live, and taking part in such actions as an attempted squatters’ take‐over of an apartment building owned by Columbia University last spring, while working for “institutional change” in the church as well. An Act of ‘Conscience’ His mother, Mrs. Estelle Fordi, 53, said in a telephone interview, “It's an act, on his part, of conscience; he's very much dedicated to his life as a priest. I know it's an act of conscience, and I feel the same way; we've been in this war, and it's an unjust war to begin with and we hoped it would be over—if it was over, these fine young men wouldn't feel compelled to do such drastic acts. I feel frustrated myself.” The response from other families to the news of the arrests was not as understanding. At the Revere, Mass., home of Lianne Moccia, who was reportedly a secretary in the philosophy department of a Catholic institution in New York, a telephone call of inquiry produced denials that. Miss Moccia lived there and refusals to comment. A. W. Dunham of Pelham, N. Y., whose daughter, Anne Dunham, 23, was among those arrested in Camden, said he had not seen his daughter for more than 10 weeks, since she dropped out of Marymount College in Manhattan. He knew, he said, that she was involved with “some kind of antiwar movement. We heard that she was going around speaking at rallies and distributing literature,” he said. A similar call to the Brightwaters, L. I., home of Rosemary Reilly and her 23‐year‐old sister, Joan, elicited only a “I'm sorry, I have nothing to say,” from a young woman who identified herself as their sister. One of the acts of nonviolent but disruptive civil disobedience in which some of those arrested yesterday had “taken responsibility” — which means publicly acknowledging that they approved of a certain undertaking, supported it, and would take part in if they had not, in fact, done so—was the “citizen's arrest” of Curtiss Tarr, director of the Selective Service System, in Washington. Among them were Rosemary Reilly and Robert G. Good, 22, of Ohio, an ex‐seminarian and former student at Xavier University in Cincinnati, who had worked in antipoverty programs In Cleveland. One of those arrested in Camden, and sources in the antiwar movement were insistent yesterday that there was no connection between the New Jersey and Buffalo incidents, was Paul Couming of Dorchester, Mass., a conscientious objector who quit his objector's hospital work, in Boston “because he refused to be an accomplice in any way with the Selective Service System,” according to a friend. Mr. Couming, 23, was one of the original organizers of the Resistance, which began in Boston as an antidraft move ment. At one time Mr. Couming took sanctuary in the Arlington Street Church in Boston when he was being sought by the Federal authorities for having refused to continue his alternate employment. He and John Swinglish, 27, were both called to Harrisburg to testify before the grand jury investigating the alleged Berrigan conspiracy plot. Both refused, and both were cited for criminal contempt. Mr. Swinglish, who is from Washington, was chairman of the Catholic Peace Fellowship there and worked at Emmaus House, community settlement house. Mr. Couming also signed a “responsibility statement” concerning the October, 1969, destruction of draft‐board files in Boston. Of those arrested in Buffalo, Charles Darst, believed to be “about” 22 years old, was the brother of David Darst, a member of the Catonsville Nine who was killed in an automobile accident. Mr. Darst, who is from Kansas City was a student at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., and was believed to be still enrolled and in good standing although he spent the last semester in Buffalo, editing a book of his brother's poems for publication. James R. Martin, 25, a former Peace Corps.‐Iunteer in Africa, spent eight years as a seminarian with the Society of the Divine Word, a missionary order. He also avowed responsibility for the Curtiss Tarr incident. Anne Masters, 26, is a New Yorker who teaches in a jobtraining program. Maureen Considine, 21, is Mr. Darst's fiancee. As a highschool student in Buffalo, she tutored black and underprivileged children in that city's slums. Now she teaches the theology of nonviolence at Mount St. Joseph's Academy in Buffalo. The Rev. Joseph O'Rourke, a Jesuit and antiwar activist who lives in the same building as Father Fordi, said it was his belief, and that of others, that the arrests were “a set‐up job,” with informers and provacateurs “getting people to break laws” to support the F.B.I.'s theory of a conspiracy. There is no conspiracy, Father O'Rourke said; beyond “a general spirit feeling of the American people that the war has to be stopped.”

442-> IN THE NATION
WASHINGTON, Sept. 6—This is Labor Day that marks the close of political recess as well as the end of summer. When the Democratic Congress gets back to town this week, it wilt face the formidable task of coping with President Nixon's so‐called New Economic Policy. The Democratic dilemma is plain. The more Congress wisely and effectively improves the President's program, the more he is likely to get credit for the economic gain that would follow. On the other hand, the more Congress hamstrings and frustrates the President, the more Mr. Nixon will be enabled to point to Congress as politically motivated and callous to the national economic interest. Either way, the “economic issue” the Democrats so confidently believed would defeat the President in 1972 disappears or diminishes. And if the Democrats do nothing at all, merely rubber‐stamping Mr. Nixon's program, they would be in poor position to exploit its inequities or even its failure to improve economic conditions. Moreover, the N.E.P. is far from perfect, and the Democratic Congress cannot, in good conscience, merely ig nore its faults—particularly when so much is being made, and properly so, of the extent to which Presidential powers already have been swellen by Congressional abdication and executive branch expansion. Big, labor, in fact,, is not likely to allow the Democrats or Congress an easy way out. George Meany is huffing, and puffing at a great rate, both about inequities and about what follows the ninety‐day wage‐price freeze. The wind from that direction alone will have Democratic leaders shivering and huddling. Probably their best response would be a reshaping of the N.E.P. that would not only speed economic recovery but give the program a distinctly Democratic cast. But how to get off Mr. Nixon's ground and onto their own? One significant step might be to refuse the $4.6‐billion package of Federal spending cuts proposed by Mr. Nixon, the burden of which falls most heavily on poor and low‐income persons. The President said he would defer his revenue sharing and welfare reform programs, reduce Federal employment 5 per cent, and postpone the Jan, Federal salary rise. The Democrats could insist that spending reductions be made only in defense, space and hardware programs and in particular that welfare reform move ahead—since poor, people are the likeliest to spend increased income. Chairman Wilbur D. Mills of the Ways and Means Committee is reported interested in a plan to “hold hostage” other aspects of the President's program until he agrees to cut far more than $4.6 billion. The idea would be to reduce the 1972 budget deficit, which probably will reach $25 billion or more. But to hold down the budget, maintain social spending and help stimulate the economy would be an intricate problem for Congressional Democrats to work out. Labor obviously is going to fight for, and no doubt the Deinocrats will be inclined to support, a different tax reduction scheme. A principal Democratic economist, Arthur Okun, has calculated that Mr. Nixon's package for business and industry is worth about $8.5 billion a year, while consumers would get only about $5 billion in relief, and that offset by a $3‐billion increase in Sobial Security taxes. Mr. Okun also argued that the Nixon plan would cut into needed long‐term revenue capacity. And ecologists and others are well aware that the result of the greatest incentives in the program will be to put more air polluting automobiles on the roads. Thus the tax reduction section of the N.E.P. may he the most promising target for a Democratic alternative. On a somewhat longer‐range basis, the Democrats can make an opportunity to move in on planning for “Phase Two” of the wage‐price freeze. Having provided the legislative authority—against Mr. Nixon's wishes—for. the freeze he subsequently invoked, the Congressional leaders have every right to make themselves heard on any long‐term plan for managing wages and prices—and to insist on including dividends and profits as well. There is no reason at all that this should be exclusively an executive branch province. The Democrats' problem would be simplified, of course, if they had a unified command. But an out‐party never does, and that is why the best bet is that Mr. Nixon will able to keep the initiative at least until wage‐price frustrations begin to boil over.

443-> Chess: Forintos Wins Tournament In Memory of Countryman
Geza Forintos, a Hungarian international master, gained 11 of ‘15 points in winning a tournament held recently at Baja, Hungary, in memory of Dr. Lajos Asztalos. Vladimir Bagirov of the Soviet Union was second with 9½‐5½, Viktor Ciocaltea of Rumania and Levente Lengyel of Hungary, the only grandmaster in the event, tied for third at 9‐6. Asztalos, who died in 1956, was a Hungarian by birth, but lived in Yugoslavia many years and played for Yugoslav teams in several early Olympiads. In a long career unmarked by any spectacular successes, he became one of the most popular players of his day, because of his unfailing gentlemanliness and good humor. In 1942, he returned to Hungary and served for a long time as vice president of the Hungarian Chess Union. It is hoped that the tournament in his memory will become an annual event. The two top finishers in this year's tournament, Forintos and Bagirov, have much in common. Both have played extremely well on occasions, but have failed to fulfill the great promise their, best results seemed to hold out for them. Forintos, 36 years old, has ‘often played like a grandmaster, but just as often failed’ badly’ in the next tournament. Taimanov Match Cited Students of the openings will recall that the line played in the game between ?? Minev and Forintos (5 B‐R4), has often been tried by Mark Taimanov, a Soviet grandmaster. In the fifth game of his recent match against Taimanov, Bobby Fischer tried 5... NxN; 6 PxN, PxP, playing to make White lose time winning his pawn back. In that game, Taimanov did win back the pawn, but achieved little else out of the opening, and an even position resulted (Taimanov blundered in the end game, and lost). The scheme Forintos adopts in this game, characterized by an early... P‐QB4, is more usual, and also sufficient to equalize. Later Black sacrifices a pawn in exchange for some lively counterplay and, when White fails to find the best defense, secures a winning attack. The game Paoli played against. Bagirov shows that experienced players often violate those tenets that a beginner can learn from any textbook. For example, it is disadvantageous to develop the queen early in the game, when it can be subjected to harassment by the enemy's minor pieces. Here is an apt illustration of that truism. ??

444-> He Believes That Four Walls Create More Than a Room
Many interior designers are content with a healthy stable of wealthy and prominent private clients. But not Angelo Donghia. He wants more than that, and he's striking out in several directions all at once to get it. To be introduced in the next two months are a raft of products conceived by Donghia, among them: ¶A collection of upholstered furniture for Interior Crafts that will be sold exclusively at Lord & Taylor beginning in mid‐September. Prices Moderate ¶A line of accessories spawned by the success of his Far Eastern tent room, the hit of Bloomingdale's model rooms last spring. Originally, he planned to have the throw pillows, bedspreads, shower curtains and fabric yardage manufactured in Pakistan, but the factory was burned out during the fighting there. So he adapted the appliquéd patterns into printed form for Bloomcraft and, in the process, brought the prices down into moderate range. The items will be available at Bloomingdale's next month. ¶A dozen lamps designed for Tyndale Inc. to be sold at a number of New York stores. ¶A collection of stylish men's shirts and strikingly patterned silk ties to be sold in Bloomingdale's. This is Donghia's playful revenge on big‐name fashion designers who, in recent years, have invaded the home‐furnishings field. And, in his spare time, Donghia's negotiating to bring out a line of linens and bath items. The ideas spring from an elegantly slender, 5‐foot‐11inch designer who has spent most of his 36 years thinking about design. “I've been involved with rooms since the age of 10—always looking at a corner and thinking about how it should be,” he recalls of his childhood in Vandergrift, Pa., where “the closest cultural center was Pittsburgh.” A graduate of the Parsons School of Design, he joined Yale Burge, Inc. (since 1966, Burge‐Donghia, Inc.). “I was 26 years old (two years in the field) when Van Day Truex, the designer, asked me to design a table setting for Tiffany's.” Since then, Donghia has vastly enlarged his scope. He has designed residences for private clients such as Mrs. William Randolph Hearst Jr., Joel Grey, the actor, and Halston, the fashion designer and close friend. Decorating for such clients inevitably led to commercial projects, such as the world headquarters of PepsiCola in Purchase, N. Y., Avnet, Inc., Warner Brothers and Allied Artists. Lounging on an armless chair that is part of the new furniture group in his elegant Upper East Side town house, Donghia talked about the philosophy that won him those commissions. “A person's life is conducted within a series of rooms that are all basically nothing but four walls, a ceiling and a floor,” he said. “Yet within this limited framework, rooms must pro‐ vide you with satisfaction and pleasure, things of beauty to enjoy, comfortable seating and every kind of convenience—to write, to listen to music, to do whatever you wish.” His handsome residence illustrates the theory. The duplex (he occupies the lower two floors) is full of surprises and expresses “the freedom in the way we live today.” The living room is a grandly formal salon with an open interior space. Furniture is arranged around the perimeter not unlike a European salon. The geometric wallpaper of silver and blue “lets the eye glide across it” to the handsome furnishings —the Venetian mirror, antique Chinese tables and porcelains. Two 6‐foot‐high Siamese dogs stand guard before the windows, left uncurtained because of “the special quality of light that streams in from the outside.” Flair for Patterns The profusion of rich pattern from the walls, the throws on ottomans and the floral‐patterned Chippendale sofa is a tailored version of the flair for patterns that characterizes & Vice Versa, the decorator fabric house that Donghia started two years ago. “Pattern is an important part of nature,” he explains of the pattern‐on‐pattern trend that is synonymous with & Vice Versa. “Walk into a jungle, a field, a beach of pebbles—nature is really nothing but pattern.” Glancing around the room, which is temporarily arranged for a private showing of his furniture line, he adds, “Take this cotton plaid on the chairs. It really has a gracious effect with all the other prints in the room, doesn't it?” The designer says that people, given the choice of a beautiful object versus an ugly one, would opt for beauty. But Donghia fears that manufacturers are controlling the taste of the public. “They are frightened by beautiful designs. They tend to look at the balance sheets and produce versions of what sold well last year rather than gamble on something new.” This belief undoubtedly influenced the formation of & Vice Versa. “I wanted to sell designs that were absolutely new, not‐on the market anywhere or even watered‐down versions of something else,” he says. He views the intrusion of fashion's big names into home furnishings with mild irritation. “The home furnishings industry has never given proper notice to the talent in its midst,” he said. “The fashion designer only knows a woman's body,” he said, “while the interior designer understands rooms as a whole. We have a vision of where a product will be used and in what context.” Donghia sees the role of the interior designer changing to meet the conditions of the future. “The age of handcraftsmanship and servants is over. No one wants to sit home and worry about their priceless objects or manage the home. “We are seeing a new form of design, one inspired by the new methods of manufacture,” he added. “I don't think that automation will destroy the beauty of things. A straight line needn't be less beautiful than 20 curved lines.”

446-> ALLISON IS FIRST IN GEORGIA RACE
BYRON, Ga., Nov. 7 (AP)—Bobby Allison drove his 1971 Ford to victory in the annual Georgia 500 race at the Byron Middle Georgia. Raceway today. He finished almost a lap ahead of Tiny Lund, in a 1970 Camaro, for his third triumph in this race. First prize was $3,275, which raised his earnings for the year to $228,075. Jim Paschal, driving a 1971 Javelin, gave Allison a hot challenge in the early stages of the $24,100 event, but Paschal's transmission failed on the 202d lap. Allison took the lead for good on the 194th lap of the 500‐lap race as Paschal finished 24th. Nine caution flags slowed the pace, reducing the victor's average speed to 80.88 miles an hour. He had qualified at 97.09.

447-> Screen: 'Unman, Wittering and Zigo'
I think it was François Truffaut who said that he could usually tell within the first five minutes whether or not a movie was any good. In the history of connoisseurship this ploy may be worth recording, but for practical criticism I doubt that it has much to recommend it—ignoring as it does movies that take a while to find themselves (at least in the viewer's mind), and movies that from a position of relative strength work inexorably toward a condition of absolute, unredeemable loss.In the latter category belongs John Mackenzie's "Unman, Wittering and Zigo," which opened yesterday at Cinema II, and which begins full of ripe and gruesome promise that very shortly turns overripe and openly ridiculous.Unman, Wittering and Zigo are the last three names on the roll call for Lower 5B, a form full of malignant malcontents at Chantry, a second-rate British public school, where young John Ebony (David Hemmings), fresh from the disillusionments of a job in advertising, has come to teach. His appointment is something of a fluke, his predecessor having died in midterm from a tumble down a nearby cliff, and almost no time at all is lost before the gentlemen of Lower 5B inform their new master that the death was no accident; his predecessor was pushed, and they did the pushing.Ebony's problem, as Lower 5B knows full well, is that if he reports the murder, nobody will believe him (he doesn't, at first, believe it himself), but if he keeps quiet and does a few favors for the class—not much work, decent grades for those who want them, bets placed and winnings collected from the local bookie, etc.—they will protect his academic career and perhaps let him survive the semester as well.A modus vivendi, the boys call it, but one that fails when Ebony learns that his appointment is not to be renewed and that he has, at Chantry, no academic career to protect—but only his own sanity and the well-being and perhaps respect of a wife (Carolyn Seymour) who is not long on wifely indulgence. It is when this happens, when the mood has all been built and the story begins to move, that "Unman, Wittering and Zigo" really falls apart, though it had never been too well glued from the beginning.But at the beginning it is easy to make excuses. And Mackenzie's spectacularly subjective camera and his Latin-encrusted boys' school and even his Lower 5B, which speaks in unison or to instantaneous cue—like some evil, over-trained minstrel troupe—invite if not the willing suspension of disbelief at least the expectation of pleasurable surrender to efficient nonsense. When that expectation is not satisfied, when the movie becomes too absurd in its inventions and too indifferent in how it works them out, the failure seems of more than ordinary proportions.Most of the performances are good, up to the level asked of them. David Hemmings's neophyte master suggests enthusiasm without sentimentality, and the boys mostly manage to project malevolence minus any regrets for their lost innocence. Nicholas Hoye as Cloistermouth, the prettiest of the fallen angels, is especially scary. Carolyn Seymour plays the young wife as if she were competing for the Glenda Jackson award in emotional reserve. But when the chips are down and she must show some feeling, it becomes apparent that there isn't any reserve; there is only no emotion.

449-> Sports of The Times
For a team that might have just blown $25,000 per man in the cyclones of Shea Stadium, the Kansas City Chiefs Were remarkably calm yesterday, They had arrived in town twa‐touchdown favoritea, they were playing the limping remnants of the New York Jets, they, were peering ahead to the really big games against Detroiti, San Francisco and Oakland. And now they had been decked, 13‐10, and the road to the Super Bowl suddenly seemed long and friendless. Len Dawson, the 36‐year‐old author of “Pressbre Quarterback,” sat in the Chiefs' locker room with his elbow jack‐knifed into a huaket of ice—the way any self‐respecting 36‐year‐old pressure quarterback with sore tendons might sit He looked like Sandy Koufax in the ice‐bucket days of his baseball career. Like the rest of the Kansas City club, Dawson conceded that the Chiefs had‐played a bad game. Like the Los Angeles Rams and Minnesota Vikings a year ago, they had tripped over the fallen bodies of Weeb Ewbank's cripples. But, like most two‐touchdown favorites; they had been upset by a combination of things—in this case, by the gusts; the Jets' four‐linebacker defense; Dawson's ailing arm, and a fumble that led to a Jet touchdown in the first four minutes. “If the wind hadn't been blowing so hard,” Dawson was saying, “it would've been a different game. I've had trouble with the arm for three or four weeks. Took a cortisone shot Friday and didn't throw at all Saturday. By the third quarter, I had to warm up a little bit before going in. “I think we planned to throw more, but we couldn't throw deep because they were playing us deep. We weren't confused by their four linebackers—not after the first series of downs—because they'd used that defense against us in the playoff two years ago. But they sealed off our pitchouts and our running game, too.” Still, Dawson managed to complete 13 passes, which was four more than the Jets even attempted. But only two found his favorite receiver, Otis Taylor, the sticky‐handed magician of the television screen this fall. If it wasn't the wind or the rotating linebackers, it was just bad luck—and the Chiefs had that in common, too, with other teams pursuit of Super Bowl gold. “They had people there all afternoon trying to doubleteam Taylor,” Dawson said, analyzing but not, complaining. “Once he got open, and the ball slipped as I was throwing. Another time, he got open, and he slipped as I was throwing. We didn't play so good.” “It's a bitter loss,” said Hank Strain, the Chiefs coach, a dapper man in a dark blue blazer, red vest and checked slacks—and one of the great cliche experts in the National Football League. “If you don't play well, you don't win, don't care who you play against. You can't assume anything. It turned into a game of opportunity for both clubs. “We talked about them all week long, about not taking them for granted. They had a 2–5 record, they were all battered, they were fighting for their life. Then we dropped the ball early and they knew they were in it. So we wound up fighting for our life.” Stram and his players had only one gripe. Late in the third quarter, with the score even at 10‐10, Bob Davis passed 17 yards to Don Maynard on the Chiefs' 45. Then Jim Marsalis, the cornerback, was called for roughing Maynard and Kansas City was penalized 15 more yards—setting up the game‐winning field goal by Bobby Howfield early the final quarter. “Unbelievable,” Stram groaned. “A ridiculous call. Marsalis just touched him. He didn't jump on him or hit him. He just wanted to make sure he was down.” “The ball was underthrown,” Marsalis reported in matter‐of‐fact way, “and he came back and caught it. “I just came down on top of him. I didn't have his face mask and I wasn't holding him. He was trying get up and in professional football if somebody doesn't down you, you can get up. “I didn't hear any whistle. The official just pointed at me and said, ‘On you, 40.’ “I learned in my first year not to argue with officials. But I'd have to see the game films on that one.” He'll get his chance to see the films tomorrow when the Chiefs review their own version of “Gone With the Wind.” They have six games to go, including the one Dec. 12 against the Oakland Raiders, who slipped past them yesterday into first place in the West. But if the Chiefs finish the season minus $25,000, they will all spend the winter remembering that gusty afternoon in Shea‐Stadium.

Two bidders have offered separate $25,000 downpayments to get a Canadian Football League franchise for New York, Deputy Mayor Richard R. Aurelio said last night. The league commissioner, Jake Gaudaur, confirmed in Toronto that he had received a bid from Robert J. Schmertz, a builder and businessman. But he did not confirm having received one from Paul Anka, the Canadian‐born singer named by Aurelio as the other bidder. Gaudaur said bids would be taken up on Nov. 26 at a league meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia. However, he noted, bids in previous years from United States cities had been rejected.

451-> Senate Panel Holds Vast ‘Subversives’ File Amassed by Ex‐Chief of Army Intelligence
WASHINGTON, Sept. 6 — A secret collection of reports on 125,000 allegedly subversive persons and organizations, the product of an extensive but unofficial intelligence operation that ranged across the nation for 23 years, is locked away today in the office of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee here. How the collection got there is known. But what it will be used for remains hidden. The subcommittee, which is headed by Senator James O. Eastland, Democrat of Mississippi, has refused to say what it intends to do with the reports. The collection is known to Insiders here as the Van Deman files. It was assembled—with official knowledge and help—by a former Army chief of intelligence, Maj. Gen. Ralph H. Van Deman, between 1929, the year of his retirement, and 1952, the year of his death. The files contain information on politicians, labor leaders, civil rights activists, actors, writers, academicians and ordinary citizens, many of them still alive, all of whom General Van Deman suspected of subversion. Among those still prominent whose dossiers are in, the files is Representative Emanuel Celler, Democrat of Brooklyn, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He was listed as a “Jew playing the Reds.” Mr. Celler could not be reached for comment. But a staff aide here said he was probably, unaware that his name was in the Van Deman files. The aide said it was not surprising that Mr. Celler should be named since “he has been attacked by right‐wingers for years.” Others listed in the files were Pearl Buck, the author; Joan Crawford and Helen Hayes, the actresses; former Representative Adam Clayton Powell of Manhattan, and Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize chemist. Attempts to reach each for comment were unsuccessful. The name of Chien Hsueh‐sen is also in the files. He is a scientist who went to Communist China in 1955 after being accuse dof being an alien Communist. He now heads the Chinese missile development program. The heart of the Van Deman files, according to military sources who have seen them, comprises confidential intelligence reports that General Van Deman obtained regularly from Army and Naval intelligence and from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He also received information from California police agencies at his home in San Diego. Moreover, the general ran a nationwide network of informants, each identified only by a coded number, who reported great volumes of raw information to hire. The files show that some information could have come only from agents who infiltrated the Communist party, labor unions, church groups and other organizations. The general himself appears to have stayed very much out of the public eye and out of political activity. Instead, he fed the intelligence he developed to the F.B.I. and the military intelligence agencies. General Nan Deman—the name rhymes with seaman—also provided information in the 1930's, and 1940's to the House Committee on Un‐American Activities, headed by Representative Martin Dies Jr., and later to the California Legislature's Committee on Un‐American Activities, headed by State Senator Jack B. Tenney. California Democrats allege that information from the Van Deman files was used by supporters of Richard M. Nixon in his campaigns against Jerry Voorhis for the House in 1946 and against Helen Gahagan Douglas for the Senate in 1950. Judge Hugo Fisher of the San Diego Superior Court, who has been active in Democratic party politics since 1946, said that material from the files appeared in the so‐called “pink sheets” distributed at rallies for Mr. Nixon and other Republicans in the 1950 campaign. Mr. Nixon repudiated some of the more violent statements in those sheets and Judge Fisher said that “it is possible, of course, that Mr. Nixon himself was unaware of the sources of this scurrilous material used by his supporters.” Asked about this, Murray Chotiner, the Washington lawyer who managed Mr. Nixon's 1950 campaign, said that the information used in that campaign was developed by “our own research people.” White House officials said they did not regard the issue of the files and past election campaigns as “pertinent.” There were also reports that information from the Van Deman files went to the late Senator Joseph R. McCarthy for his use against those he called Communists and Communist sympathizers. Former associates of the Senator said that this was likely, but that they could not recall definitely since that was 20 years ago. When General Van Deman died in January, 1952, at the age of 86, The San Diego Union said that “his knowledge of, Red activities in the subversive, line probably was not exceeded by any other American.” The general's files were split after his death, the major portion being taken over by the Army and used by Federal agencies, until 1968, to check on possible subversives. Another portion went to a private library in San Diego, where they were used, until 1962, to screen applicants for California state Jobs. Last March, the Army's collection of the Van Deman files was passed on to the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, according to a letter from J. Fred Buzhardt, general counsel of the Department of Defense, to Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr., chairman of a subcommittee investigating Army surveillance of civilians. The security subcommittee's chief counsel, J. G. Sourwine, declined to acknowledge that the subcommittee had the files in hand. A spokesman for Senator Eastland, however, did acknowledge it and said the files would not be opened to public inspection. According to the military sources who have seen the Van Deman files, they are divided into four parts, of which the investigative section is the most important. An Army memorandum written after an inspection of the files last winter said that General Van Deman's “ability to obtain information and the extent of his liaison [with Federal agencies] are perhaps the most striking features of the files.” “He regularly received classified domestic intelligence reports from the Army and the Navy,” the memorandum said. “The number of F.B.I. summaries, reports and photographs indicates that he could upon request obtain information from the bureau.” A spokesman for the F.B.I. contended, however, that those reports could not have come directly froth the bureau, which, he said, does not give out information to unauthorized persons. The Army memorandum continued: “It is also evident that Van Deman had an unknown number of investigators working directly for him.” It said, “They, attended meetings and reported to him via unsigned reports annotated by a symbol, such as 109‐H, the code for a particular agent or source.” The memorandum concluded that “the extent, detail and, quality of information obtained by Van Deman is remarkable.” A second section of the files is a fairly complete set of allegedly Communist and Communist‐affiliated newspapers, now defunct, on the West Coast. The Army memorandum said, “It is reasonable to believe that some of these papers may be available from no other source.” A third section, said the memorandum, is a “remarkably complete” collection of largely out‐of‐print pamphlets and books, written by supposed Communists, that historical researchers might not be able to get anywhere else. Lastly, the Van Deman files include hundreds of pictures of alleged subversives, plus some pictures of General Van Deman's own agents. Those who have examined the files said that the general's initial attention focused on supposed Communists. A secondary concern was the labor movement, which General Van Deman thought to be heavily infiltrated by Communists. But by the late 1940's, the general's interest shifted to the civil rights movement. He was said to have thought that racial unrest in the nation was largely fomented by the Communist party. The Army inspection of the files last winter indicated that some of his reports had been lent to the Army and the F.B.I. A spokesman for the F.B.I. acknowledged that the bureau had borrowed Van Deman reports and said that this was proper, since a citizen had an obligation to report information he thought might be useful to the bureau. Among the reports signed out to the Fifth Army and the F.B.I. in 1961 were those on a Communist meeting, a meeting of the adult discussion class at the First Unitarian Church in San Diego, a union meeting of Lodge K of the Aircraft. Lodge 1125, and a Democratic rally at Roosevelt Junior High School, all in California in 1944. The Van Deman files, also contain a letter, dated in May, 1951, from an agent in Saudi Arabia. It went into detail, on the Middle East situation at the time, then asked for a man experienced in operating a wireless and in using small arms. The man requested was also to have been knowledgeable on the latest movements within the Communist world. General Van Deman was initially an Army surgeon but went into intelligence in the Philippines In 1908 under Gen. Arthur MacArthur, Gen. Douglas MacArthur's father. General Van Deman was head of military intelligence in Washington from May, 1917, to June, 1918. During that period, he was instrumental in organizing units of volunteer civilian sleuths, such as the American Protective League, that kept watch for signs of disloyalty and reported to military intelligence. Those contacts appear to have continued during the rest of his Army career and after his retirement in 1929. These volunteer sleuths may have been among the agents he used in his private network of informants. It is not known whether any of his informants were paid. Not much is known about General Van Deman himself. Being a professional intelligence officer, he kept out of sight. But he appears to have been a persistent, even dogged man. Once, during World War I, other officers scoffed at him for being too security‐conscious. He” therefore had their desks rifled of confidential papers at night and called them up the next morning to ask Where the papers were. Stricter security control's were quickly set up. The general also appears to have deeply feared that the United States would be subverted by foreign powers unless it maintained an extensive internal and external intelligence service. Over, years his focus shifted from fears of a German conspiracy to one initiated by the Soviet Union. He apparently was able to persuade others in high places of his view. When he began his private operation in 1929, he was supported by the Army, which gave him two civilian employes, filing cabinets and working materials. His wife algo assisted him. The major portion of the files were taken over by the Sixth Army headquarters in 1952, after General Van Deman's death, and shipped to Fort Holabird, Md., in 1968. There they were integrated into the United States Army Investigative Records Repository, the Army's master file of personnel investigations. The Van Deman files at Fort Holabird, however, were segregated from the repository in 1968 and the card‐file index destroyed, making the files difficult to use except by laborious search. The key index, identifying the general's agents and sources, also disappeared; according to military sources. Last Winter, when the Army came under fire for its surveillance of civilians, the Van Deman files were inspected by Army officials from the Pentagon. The report from the inspectors to senior Army officials said, “There may be some embarrassment to the Army because of the information contained on labor and civil rights movements. The question of the Army's relationship to Van Deman could also be embarrassing.” The inspectors recommended that the, Van Deman files be given to Army historians because “the value of these documents from an historical aspect is unquestionable, particularly from the standpoint of methodology.” But senior civilian officials Of the Army felt that the files were politically too hot. They arranged, military sources said, for Senator Eastland to ask for the files, which were then delivered to his subcommittee. The delivery was made the day that Robert F. Froehlke, then an Assistant Secretary of Defense and now Secretary of the Army, appeared before Senator Ervin's subcommittee to testify on the Army's role in watching civilians. That way, the military sources said, Mr. Froehlke could truthfully say, if asked, that the Army no longer had the Van Deman files. He was not asked. The portion of the Van Deman files that remained in California was given to the San Diego Research Library setup in 1952 by three of General Van Deman's associates: Maj. Gen. George W. Fisher of the California National Guard; Col. Frank C. Forward, commander of intelligence operations of the California Guard, and Alfred Loveland, a San Diego businessman. They continued to add information to the files. The research library fires. housed in the National Guard Armory in. San Diego, were used by Govs. Earl Warren (later Chief Justice of the United States), Goodwin Knight and Edmund G. Brown to check on the backgrounds of prospective state appointees. In 1962 California's Attorney General, Stanley Mosk, had the research library files seized on grounds that material from them had been used “by um, authorized persons for political purposes.” Mr. Nixon, then campaigning against Governor Brown, protested that the legislature should look into the allegedly illegal seizure. After the San Diego Research Library threatened a court suit, the files were returned. They went into a vault in the San Diego Title Trust and Insurance Company, of which Colonel Forward was an officer. Colonel Forward was asked recently whether the papers were still in San Diego. “Yes, you can assure that they are,” he said, “but I can't tell you where.” Asked who was in charge of them, he replied: “I am not at liberty to talk about that.”

452-> Nader Organizing Doctors To Monitor the Profession
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., June 7 (AP) — Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, said today that he was organizing a group of medical doctors who will monitor the medical profession the way his lawyer groups have dealt with onsumers problems. Mr. Nader said that he be lieved the group was necessary because pressures to change the medical profession had not come from within. “The medical world itself does not have an institutional ized mechanism for criticizing itself,” he said. The group, he said, will begin first by dealing with food and drug regulations and preven tive medicine, “one of the major health problems in the nation.”

453-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: The steadily increasing financial pressure on the city's libraries, museams and other cultural and recreational facilities calls for a new approach to the problem of maintaining these vitally necessary services. I am certain that there are thousands of New Yorkers who would give some of their time without pay to provide needed manpower. We need a Civic Service Corps to provide this help. Perhaps one of the large founda tions, or if not, the city itself, could take on the burden of establishing the administrative procedures needed to locate citizens anxious to contribute their services and to arrange schedules.

454-> RANGERS FLY HIGH WITH BEST RECORD
Following a smashing three‐game trip on which they scored one of their most decisive victories away from home, the Rangers returned last night with the best record in the National Hockey League. After one month of play, they lead the Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins, Eastern Division favorites. They have an 11‐game unbeaten string (eight victories and three ties) and six games remaining in a nine‐game stretch against expansion teams. The latest triumph came Saturday afternoon at Vancouver, British Columbia, where Rod. Gilbert recorded his second straight two‐goal game in a 3‐1 decision. The night before the Rangers blasted the California Golden Seals at Oakland by 8‐1, equaling the biggest victory margin a Ranger team had compiled on the road. The trip began lest Wednesday, with a 7‐1 victory over the Kings at Los Angeles. On the road the Rangers are unbeaten with six victories and two ties. Also, unbeaten is Gilles Villemure, nominally the No. 2 goalie. He has appeared in six games—including the first two on the West Coast. Perhaps the most significant of the 18 goals scored on the trip was the one by Walt Tkaczuk at Oakland. Tkaczuk, the team's leading point‐getter the last two seasons, hadn't scored in the first 12 games. Ted Irvine, who also had been scoreless, got two goals against his former teammates at Los Angeles. With four goals and three assists on the trip, Gilbert moved into first place in the league scoring. He has 10 goals and 14 assists for 24 points. His line, with Jean Ratelle and Vic Hadfield, led the league as of last night. It had amassed 66 points in 14 games. The, next opponent is the Kings at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday. They have a better record on the road (two victories, one loss, one tie) than at home, where they haven't won.

455-> Unit Pricing in Stores Spreading Rapidly Across U.S.
WASHINGTON, June 7 — It's called Compar‐A‐Buy in Chicago, Valu‐Price in Boston, Un I Price In Los Angeles, Chek‐Mate in Denver. Valu Chek in Phoenix and Tru‐Price in Burlington, Iowa. By any name, it is unit pric ing—the posting of prices by the ounce, pound, pint or other appropriate unit. The purpose is to tell shoppers at a glance what brand or size of a product is most economical. The system — which went into effect under law in New York City last week — has been spreading widely, to the extent that two states have already enacted unit pricing laws and 10 other states and more than 200 cities and coun ties are considering their adop tion. If success is measured by growth, unit pricing is a smash hit. In a little more than a year it has proliferated from an experiment in two Safeway stores here to be an established system in uncounted hundreds of supermarkets throughout the country. At least a few food stores in all of the country's major marketing centers have put it into effect. If measured by the extent that it is used by shoppers, however, the success of unit pricing is spotty. Recent in quiries in various parts of the country yielded reports on con sumer usage ranging from “poor” to “spectacular.” In most stores employing the system, unit‐price labels print ed by computers are posted on the shelves or bins where products are displayed. Each label gives the name of the product, and contents in ounces or other measure, the price of the item and the price per unit of measure. For example: 10 oz Cheerios Price each .38 Price per pound .61 The rapid spread of the pric ing device has been spurred partly by the threat of legis lation to make it compulsory. In New York City, a regu lation requiring unit prices to be posted on a broad range of products in large supermar kets went into effect June 1. The states that have enacted unit pricing laws are Massa chusetts and Maryland. The Massachusetts law is effective in three stages from last May 24 to next Sept. 20, the Mary land law goes into effect next January. Aside from trying to ward off legislation, food retailers have found unit pricing to be a good merchandising technique even if relatively few customers may be making use of it. Cou pled iwth competitive forces, this is mainly responsible, according to expert opinion, for its rising popularity in the food industry. The Jewel Companies, Inc., which introduced unit pricing in its 258 stores in the Chicago area last March, has found it to be “a good marketing tool, creating customer satisfaction and assuring customers of Jewel's interest in providing them with helpful consumer in formation.” A. J. Bayless Markets, Inc., of Phoenix, Ariz., reported “many complimentary letters” and “front‐page publicity” since the adoption of unit pricing by its 42 stores last February. Estimates of customer usage varied radically. Clarence Ad amy, president of the National Associations of Food Chains, said that reports from his mem bers indicated that only 3 to 4 per cent of the shoppers in stores with unit pricing regu larly checked the listings to make price comparisons. In contrast, Charles Fitzmor ris, president of the Benner Tea Company, of Burlington, Iowa that said a poll of 200 patrons of the company's 21 stores in Iowa, Illinois and Mis souri indicated that 5 per cent used the uint prices in making selections. Of those polled, 57 per cent expressed belief that they saved money by compar ing unit prices. The Benner chain installed full‐scale unit pricing on a per manent basis on June 1, 1970. Unit prices are posted on vir tually all of the 3,500 items carried. Some other chains post unit prices on comparatively few items, and Mr. Fitzmorris attributed the relatively low rate of usage to that fact. Housewives are likely to be come frustrated on finding that many items are not covered by the pricing system and “just chuck the whole thing,” Mr. Fitzmorris theorized. Mr. Fitzmorris produced fig ures showing that sales in Ben ner stores rose 7.1 per cent after unit pricing was intro duced. In dollar volume, Ben ner sales for the last quarter of 1970 were 8.7 per cent high er than those for the corres ponding period of 1969. All chains of comparable size showed an average sales in crease of 1.6 per cent. Giant Foods, Inc., with 94 stores in the Washington‐Balti more area, installed unit pric ing for virtually all of its 9,100 items last November. Mrs. Es ther Peterson, the chain's con sumer adviser, estimated that regular usage had risen from 4 per cent of the stores' patrons at the start to about 15 per cent. “We think it's increasing sales,” Mrs. Peterson, who was President Johnson's first special assistant for consumer affairs, reported. The widespread habit of buy ing by brand name rather than price is an apparently major factor in the spotty consumer acceptance of unit pricing. This belief was substantiated by some interviews with patrons here. The interviews, conduct ed at Giant and Safeway stores, also bore out findings of pre vious surveys that pinching pennies was more appealing to the affluent than to the needy. Dr. Monroe Peter Friedman of Eastern Michigan University found in a study last year that 38 per cent of the shoppers in Safeway store in a prosperous, virtually all‐white section of suburban Alexandria, Va., had used unit pricing. He found that 25 per cent had done so in an inner‐city Safeway patronized mainly by low‐income Negroes. With most of the country's grocery chains already com puterized, the cost of in stalling and operating unit price systems was described by in dustry sources as “minimal.” The consensus was that the costs were largely or wholly offset by coincidental savings in inventory control expenses and need not be passed along to customers. Mrs. Peterson estimated Gi ant's costs at $35,000 for set ting up the system and $150 a year for its operation in each store. Mr. Fitzmorris said it cost Benner $200 per store to install unit pricing and $260 year for each store to operate it. A patron of Giant in Beth esda, Md., complained of price rises, attributing them to unit pricing despite Mrs. Peterson's assurance that “it's not costing consumers a thing.” “I think it's a gimmick, re ally, to get you to buy more,” Mrs. Judith F. Jamieson, the patron, said. “I find things are higher. You save only a couple of cents by comparing prices, and you have to buy an awful lot to save much.” In Los Angeles, her senti ment was echoed by a customer of Ralph's Grocery Company, which started unit pricing in its 63 stores last August. Mrs. Silvi Cooperman called it “another way to bamboozle the shopper,” adding: “The two‐for 15 cents item became 8 cents each, and the two‐for‐29 cents item be came 15 cents each. Where's the bargain in that?”

456-> An ultra‐modern miracle that began at Rectigraph
The story of Xerox Corpora tion is Exhibit “A” for con temporary free‐enterprise ideal ists, demonstrating that in the age of supercorporations, gov ernment regulation and admin istered prices a better mouse trap can still be a path of suc cess, nice guys in business can still finish first, etc. Of course, those things don't happen every day; and by thus pro viding the idealists with ammu ninon, Xerox has helped per petuate a possibly dangerous myth; but that's hardly Xerox's fault. John Hans Dessauer was in the thick of the Xerox story all the way, from the moment in 1935 when, a political refugee from Germany, working as a young engineer in America, he found to his dismay that Recti graph, the little photographic company he was employed by, had been sold to another Roch ester firm then called Haloid and later to become Xerox. He became head of research for Haloid in 1938 and, in that ca pacity, in the postwar years, presided over the development of the Xerox copying machines that not only brought the com pany financial success beyond the dreams of avarice but added a word to the language and quite conceivably brought a permanent alteration in the use and impact of the written word itself. Thus “My Years With Xerox” is really the legend of Xerox, It is a legend the general out lines of which are already well known to people who follow such things: how in 1938 a young patent attorney named Chester F. Carlson, moonlight ing as an inventor in a make shift laboratory in Astoria, Queens, invented the wholly new electrostatic dry‐copying process later called xerography; how for years nobody, but no body, wanted it; how little Hal oid finally took it on, and how the company gambled its exis tence on converting the inven tion into a product; how its first commercial xerographic copier, produced in 1950, was an instant flop, how the com pany persevered and in 1959 came up at last with the 914 copier, quite possibly the most successful commercial product in history. But Dessauer's telling adds some new touches—for exam ple, the engaging detail that it was thought the presence of a fire extinguisher attached to the indisputably sometimes in flammable 914 would be disas trous to sales, and how the problem was solved by attach ing the extinguisher but euphe mistically labeling it a “scorch eliminator.” Not to joke, com mercial history often turns on such things. More substantially, Dessauer gives a charming and moving account of the previously quite mysterious Chet Carlson, an Edison or Bell of his time. Never an officer of Xerox, he nonetheless became immensely rich, before his death in 1968, from royalties on his patents. Always quiet and withdrawn, he became depressed by his long failure to sell his inven tion, and his disappointment destroyed his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1945, almost on the eve of the first commercial acceptance of xer ography. By the time he was 40, he was deeply bent and con stantly tortured by arthritis. In the 1950's, as xerography was becoming big business at last, he began to lose interest in it and to turn to psychical research and the occult. Under the influence of his second wife, Dorris, he became a dev otee of Zen Buddhism. Racked with pain, lost in thought, he would hold full‐dress Zen re flection sessions at his home outside Rochester, to which brisk and ambitious young Xerox engineers would come, torn between hero‐worship, perplexity and perhaps the contempt of ignorance. Once, visiting New York City short ly before his death, he bought a gas balloon at the Central Park zoo and immediately re leased it to the air. “I just wanted the pleasure,” he told Dorris, “of seeing something go free.” A suggestive episode, a little sad with its hint that Carlson the philosopher never escaped the reference terms of Carlson the scientific inventor; and a suggestive American life, to which I hope will soon be given a book of its own. Beyond that, “My Years With Xerox” is a disappointment. Composed with the “help” of the journalist Oscar Schisgall, it is too often footling and slick. John Dessauer in the flesh is a slangy, tangy man with a swift and incisive conversation al style; but when that style is passed through the filter of conventional journalism, the story of Dessauer and Xerox often comes out as bathetic as if, say, Howard Cosell were try ing to give an eyewitness ac count of the siege of Troy. Ghost‐writing is the curse of contemporary business autobi ography. If only Dessauer had had the patience, and the nerve, simply to talk his story into recorder and to publish the re sult as little edited as possible, what a zesty and memorable book we might have had!

457-> V. S. Naipaul, Man Without A Society
LONDON. He seems to be in the throes of continuing identity crisis, painfully examining each marker of position, uncertain most of all about his own place. In conversation he switches continuously from first person “I” to second person “you” to third per son “one” all to indicate him self, V. (for Vidiadhar) S. (for Sura jprasad) Naipaul, author—party of the first, second and third parts. Born in Chaguanas, Trinidad, grandson of a Hindu who had come to the island from Uttar Pradesh (India) as an indentured laborer, he was colonial and yet not colonial, on intimate and yet alienated terms with life about him. Mr. Naipaul's father was a re porter for the Trinidad Guardian who occasionally supplied visiting journ alists with picturesque copy about Indian customs. He was not very tolerant of Hindu beliefs and rituals, and no record was kept of the hour of V.S. Naipaul's birth on Aug. 17, 1932. No horoscope was drawn up. “A pity,” says the shortchanged son. “1 would have liked to have a horo scope.” Those drawn to the family chron icle may find an account of his fa ther, Seepersad Naipaul, being threat ened with death in 1933 for writing that native farmers of Hindu origin had defied government regulations for combating cattle diseases by sub stituting ancient rites of the Hindu goddess Kali. The account maintains that Naipaul pere appeased the god dess by offering a goat sacrifice. Naipaul fits says this was clearly a joke against his father by the report er who wrote the account. V. S. Naipaul's father died of non occult causes in 1953. He left be hind him not only V. S. but also second writing son, S. (for Shiva) Naipaul, whose novel “Fireflies” was published recently. There are also five daughters—three of them teach ers in Trinidad, one a teacher in Jamaica and one about to enter an English university. When V. S. Naipaul was in the fourth form at Queen's Royal Col lege, in Port‐of‐Spain, he wrote vow in his Revised Latin Primer to leave Trinidad within five years. It took him six. “The society I came from was co lonial and was originally a slave so ciety to which, later, people like myself, from Asia, went. There was a double inferiority about it: the slave society which created nothing, which depended for everything on the master society, and the Asiatic living in this closed society of myth. “I read people like Balzac and Tolstoy in addition to the English writers. When I com pared what I read with what saw round me, there was no re lationship. And when I began to write, my great problem was to render, even in my own mind, my material worthy of being written about. “The people I saw were little people who were mimicking upperclass respectability. They had been slaves; and you can't write about that in the way that Tolstoy wrote about even his backward society, for his society was whole and the one I knew was not. “People get very angry about slavery; but, if you write that the slave society is inferior, everyone who lives there gets very upset. They think that they are totally whole. “When I was a child in Trinidad—and the horror of this is that I am horrified only today and was not horrified in 1942—there were eight or per haps 12 free places in the sec ondary schools. Twelve free places in an island that had a population of over half a mil lion. What an attitude to human beings! “The British have a Sunday school reaction to all this. They reduce the history of slavery not to the horrors of the crime extending over a couple of hundred years, but to the few years of the fight to abolish it. “You have very nice liberal people who go out to a colony — which is a deliberately created inferior society — and wonder why people in that place are inferior and why if they wish to become writers they have to leave. They would not ask Hemingway why he left his own provincial town; they would not ask Pound why he left the Middle West, but they will always ask the man from what they accept as an inferior society. “I started by thinking that was a totally whole person, and part of the falsity of my literary ambition was that took the models of writers who came from whole societies — England, Russia, France. Then I was let down by my material, my life, my own background. For me to come to London and to be a writer, as a colonial, was a grotesque misreading of the world. As I grow older I'm more and more aware of the great vacuum behind me. think about it every night. “You write in London and you don't have an audience— you are just hanging in the air and being an artist in a vacuum, which is nonsensical: My reputation is dry, without dialogue; it stands by itself, without comprehension or feed back. But an artist needs to be nourished, needs an audience and a response. A writer must be supported by the knowledge that he comes from a society with which he is in dialogue. A writer like myself has no so ciety, because one comes from a very small island which hardly provides an audience; and one's books are published in London because one of the great lega cies of imperialism is that the English ‐ speaking world is divided between New York and London. “What a wasteland it must have been for the Jew ish immigrant in New York be fore the Jewish writers came along, when he didn't see him self reflected in the books he was told to read. “In New York the Jewish writers have an audience, a dialogue, attacks, jealousy a tremendous feeding life. They may complain about it, but it nourishes them. Most intelli gent Jewish people in New York have probably read the work of about half a dozen Jewish writers—writing about people like themselves — and they have a greater sense of themselves, a sense of their reality.” He attended University Col lege at Oxford. After Oxford he edited a weekly literary script for the B.B.C. and did some broadcasting himself. Mr. Naipaul remembers that he was determined not to ac cept regular employment. For 10 weeks in 1957 he wrote public‐relations copy for a con crete company in London. He was supposed to write articles about buildings and he wrote a few that he says were very bad. The job didn't really re quire one to write well, he explains. All that was required was a presence — people had bought him, had bought his services. One lunchtime he walked out of his job—and back to serving himself. “I began to write, I am afraid, for no other reason than because I thought it would be nice to be a writer. I had nothing to say. My vision of writing and the life it meant was so childish, really—writ ing articles and having them collected and all this sort of rubbish—which has nothing to do with writing. “One began with this very romantic vision of the writer as a free, gifted, talented, cre ative, admired person—with writing as a kind of social and cultural and sexual attribute. One saw writing as a great cherishing of the self—by oth ers and by oneself: people pub lishing your diaries, worrying about what you did, your let ters and that sort of thing. You know, ‘This very interest ing man.’ One assumed it was all very interesting, writing these fabulous things, without pausing to consider what went before—and during—the writ ing of the fabulous things. “You saw the rows of books without thinking that talents can wither, go sour, or that you're going to be dead before all the books are written; or that you might die during the writing of one book. “In fact writing is just a sort of disease, a sickness. It's a form of incompleteness, it's a form of anguish, it's despair. “There are hundreds of peo ple now who wish to be writ ers. They read Hemingway— this lovely man sitting there in Paris, drinking, wenching, big game‐hunting —and somehow just write about being a writ er, that sort of nonsense. There are so many people who wish to become writers that Hem ingway has become a popular writer, largely because every one who reads Hemingway sees himself as a writer. They're totally unattached, they're very attractive, they have this enor mous quiet skill, and somehow they're always writing about this very quiet skill they have. It's a great solipsistic system.” He lived in London bedsit ters, and he wrote: “All mythi cal lands faded, and in the big city I was confined to a small er world than I had ever known. I became my flat, my desk, my name.” Often, nod ding off with the electric heat er on, he would wake to a nightmare that he was in trop ical Trinidad. Finally he visited India; and it, too, seemed a nightmare. His critical reputation grew —for the spare lucidity of his prose, for the riotous humor of the West Indian dialogue, characters and narration in his comic novels. Each time he fin ished a book he felt it the best he could write—not one that he could improve if only he could have one more day with the galleys. The very typ ing had to be impeccable—no words changed, none scored out. He wrote: “The Mystic Mas seur,” “The Suffrage of El vire,” “Miguel Street,” “A House for Mr. Biswas,” “The Middle Passage” (a book of nonfiction about the West In dies), “Mr. Stone and the Knights Companion,” “An Area of Darkness” (about his Indian trip), “The Mimic Men,” “A Flag on the Island” (short stories), “The Loss of El Dorado” (a histoty of brutish colonialism). Six novels, three works of non fiction, one correction of short stories. It took him five years to write the first three books— and he recalls earning for them a total of £300 ($840, at the rate of exchange current then). Mr. Natpaut decided there were three ways he could get on in his writing—with sex, with an English or American character, or with race. He dismissed the first option be cause his mother would be shocked; the second he reject ed because it would be good business but bad art; and the third alternative seemed to dis miss itself. For all his disappointments, he compiled an awesome rec ord of prizes won: The Som erset Maugham Award, The Phoenix Trust Award, The Haw thornden Prize, The John Llew ellyn Rhys Memorial Prize, the W. H. Smith Award. It was not enough. “When one was young one behaved as though there was God—that God was publisher, editor and critic; and, if you were goad, regardless of your background and your themes, you would be received into the pantheon of writers. But in fact virtue is not rewarded. If you're a Yugoslav, for ex ample, there's no God for you, for God is going to have to go through an awful lot of Eng lish and French writing before He comes to Serbo‐Croat. “As you get older, the work gets more difficult because the writing inevitably becomes more complex. The thought of writing for the rest of one's life is a nightmare. I find it so hard now, particularly fiction, which in my own practice of it has changed—because the world is so complex. As you get older and understand more, you no longer have the flat view of the world—flat and sometimes cruel. As you grow older you understand people a lot more; you have greater sym pathy with people; you enter into them much more. “At this age, when I am nearly 40, one is landed with a profession; and the great fear one has Is that one has committed oneself to a ra ther futile occupation. Perhaps one should have committed one‐ self to a much more active life—journalism? politics? busi ness? “The romantic vision is gone. I'd be delighted to stop—now. Seven years ago I remember thinking, if someone said to you, ‘I'll give you £1,000,000, you must stop writing, never write another word,’ I would have said no, quite seriously, without any regrets. Today would probably do it for much less.”

458-> Jingo Django
Not so much a fiction as a string ing together of events, ideas, charac terizations and stylistic devices in imitation of a fiction, Sid Fleisch man's “Jingo Django” is slickly pro duced, ultimately inadequate. Having some time before been abandoned to a Boston orphanage, and being unwilling to continue in the chimney‐sweep trade to which he has been rented out, Jingo Hawk makes his escape with a mysterious long‐legged gentleman who may be his father and with whom, in the year 1854, he sets off to Mexico in search of buried treasure and his own more deeply buried past. In the course of his journey he meets many adventures, makes some friends, out wits some enemies — and yet noth ing fulfills any necessity more im portant than the necessity of stick ing in so much of adventure, of friends, of foilable enemies. But “Jingo Django” also leaves a lot out. Despite the journey down the length of the continent there is no real sense of place, and for all the trappings of the mid‐19th cen tury there is almost no sense of time—or of the times, from which a book might draw some meaning. There is, however, a vast amount of color—not local color; colorful col or—personal idiosyncrasies without individual character, intrigue with out involvement, excitements with out risk. Each short chapter moves predictably to a mechanical surprise in the last line or two, and the ef fect is of a nervously manipulative energy rather than of a care for the complications and discoveries of real story telling. Strangely enough the book gets worse as it goes along —as it is crammed more and more full of events that become increasingly schematic, more fantas tic but less imaginative. Jingo himself seems a pleasantly ironic, enterprising narrator; and ex cept when he too strongly calls to mind his betters (Huck Finn, for an obvious example), he even seems sophisticated enough to carry a more thoughtful, more deeply felt tale than this one. But everybody around him, from the mysterious and benign Mr. Peacock‐Hemlock‐Jones to the chief of chimney sweeps, the devious and devilish General Dirty‐Face Jim Scur lock, is too perfunctory, too immediately useful and then too easily disposable for Jingo to sharpen his wits on. “Jingo Django” is illustrated by Eric von Schmidt with drawings of a somewhat derivative inspiration, an uncomfortable busyness and an applied charm.

459-> The Threat to Newark
The Newark Board of Education meeting Tuesday night had been billed as a public hearing on the ratification the agreement to end the ten‐week‐old teachers strike. It was instead an orgy of intimidation and coercion an audience packed with ultramilitant black‐power advocates tried to engineer a takeover of the schools. Specific issues of the settlement terms were ignored. With violent rhetoric, the opponents denounced the contract as “racist” and threatened physical reprisals against board members who might support the contract. A white reporter for this newspaper was assaulted, had his notes confiscated and was warned to stay out of Newark. The strike settlement that was made the pretext for this confrontation had been recommended to the board by Mayor Gibson. Far from being racist in quality, would give to all teachers — black and white — the essential security of normal contractual safeguards. Last night the board completed, its sabotage of the peace effort by rejecting the contract it had tentatively accepted last week. The extremists organized effort to destroy the teachers’ union, turn the school board into a captive body and make the schools the exclusive power preserve of black militants is a direct challenge to Mayor Gibson's capacity to keep Newark an open city. The issue is no longer simply settlement of a strike that was provoked and needlessly prolonged by the school board's intransigence; it is rather whether Newark's schools, and ultimately the city itself, are to be governed by law or by mob. The forces which took over the contract hearings would in effect make of Newark a closed, black city, prison built by extremists, cut off from representative government and from all sources of support. This would be tantamount to municipal suicide. Mayor Gibson has tried with much skill and courage to prevent such tragedy. He cannot now allow these efforts to be shattered by a school board that has become the captive of a coercive mob.

460-> Books of The Times
THE SEASON OF THE WITCH. By James Leo Herlihy. 384 pages. Simon & Schuster. $6.95. I suppose it's just a matter of where your head is at. If you're a new head, a greened head, the sort of head that jets into the Ionosphere on love zaps and letting it all hang out, you're going to go with Gloria Random all the way. And superdig James Leo Herlihy's new novel, “The Season of the Witch.’ Maybe even find it to be “The Catcher in the Rye'’ of the Aquarian Age. But if you're stuck back here with me in the Piscean Age, putt‐putting along in a cubed head on square wheels, throwing out hand signals to the right and left, you may have difficulties with the book. It depends on where your head is at. Undeniably, Mr. Herlihy has created something of a tour de force by climbing in side the head of 19‐year‐old, very NOW, moon‐in‐Scorpio Gloria and writing her diary‐autobiography. “Fantasy: The simple act of running away from home causes some miraculous change in my character! I become disciplined. I keep my journal faithfully, every single day … To keep myself honest, I vow it's not for publication. Then, one day in New York, when I've got enough material to fill a good fat book, I lose the notebook on the subway. By chance, it gets found. By a reader for a publishing house, etc., etc. The Detroit News calls it the Most Fabulous Human Document of Our Time, Time magazine prints my picture. (On the cover?) Much success. Mutt money. We buy a strip of land in Central America, start a new nation dedicated to love and peace. Live happily ever after. End of fantasty.” Admittedly, Gloria sounds like the real enough thing. One grows quickly fond of her, one sympathizes with her hang‐ups, takes a measure of vicarious delight in her openness, one rollercoasts on her highs and bummers. Herlihy is resourceful in thinking up endless new, very youth‐culture adventures for her to get into after she runs away from home in Michigan with her homosexual boyfriend, who is escaping the draft. Herlihy seems to have the whole scene down pat: the rip‐offs in the East Village; tribal‐family life in a rundown house on Canal Street; characters named Sally Sunshine, Archie Fiesta, Cary Colorado; acid trips (hard stuff not allowed); a cosmetician devoted to Making a star out of everyone he meets; Moratorium Day; the Electric Prunes; 0 Wow. As he has already shown in his two previous novels, “All Fall Down” and “Midnight Cowboy,” he really has this touch fag feeding souls and seeing the world their way. And he dreams up some funny scenes and groovy dialogue (He: “SuperpluperfectfantabulousmcThwirpl” She: “Superpluperfectfantabuous McThwirp? He: “Right.” She: “Love the Malwirp.” He: “Thanks. Thought you would.”) And so, I imagine, anyone who takes the revolution for granted will read this the way certain of us used to read the Hardy Boys. But if by chance one is not quite grooving on the “new” culture, one may read the book from a slightly different point of view. Myself, I still see individual souls as being confined to individual bodies, which made me just a smidgen uneasy with the collective‐soul sessions, the ghosts that talk, the we are‐God trips, and the power of love that Herlihy lays down. And because found it difficult to get with it—to forget that it is really Herlihy's voice, not Gloria's, we are listening to, I kept half‐expecting him to do something with my skepticism—to toy with it, to confirm it by dashing these ethereal souls on the heavy rocks of the straight world, or to zap the straight world with some unpredictable twist of irony. But he never does, really, and I didn't know quite how to take it all, except not too seriously. Oh, there Is a heavy. One of Gloria's reasons for heading to New York is to look up her real father, a Jew from Poland named Hank Glyczwycz, whom Gloria's uptight, mother loved and left in her presuburban days, and from whose last name (pronounced Glizwitch) Gloria takes her tripping‐out name, Witch Gliz. Glyczwycz is an old socialist who views the flower children with a good old socialist's disdain. There are the makings of a square's denouement in the clash of attitudes between Gloria's father and her tribe's paterfamilias, but it is dissipated in alcohol and a somewhat gratuitous flirtation with incest. (Gloria doesn't bother to identify herself as Hank's daughter until he is on the verge of seducing her, which seems a very preAquarian plot‐ploy.) I don't wish to sound quite so negative; “The Season of the Witch” has many charms. But put it this way: while telling Gloria why she isn't succeeding in her ambition to become a professional pornographer, one of the characters explains that “if it were art, it'd make you high. Art always does that … and that's how you [can] tell good art from bad.” I didn't get high.

A disappointing biography of the Vulgar Supreme of Amer ican pop music, the ever young, ever lovin’ Elvis Presley, by a contributing editor of Rolling Stone. There should have been more than the endless details of contracts, appearances and money‐making, but there ain't. Lots on the business wizardry of manager Col. Tom Parker, who made Elvis and himself “rich as rajahs.” This is really no more than a star biography; not a shred of interpretation of Elvis's music, choreography, popularity, mystique. Elvis is king, but why you'd never know from this book.

462-> Chairman of Adelphi U. Board Is Named as Acting President
GARDEN CITY, L. I., June 7 —Randall P. McIntyre, chair man of the board of trustees of Adelphi University since Oc tober, 1970, and vice president of McIntyre Aviation, Inc. of Ronkonkoma, L. I., has been named acting president of the university, effective June 15. Mr. McIntyre was recom mended by a presidential search committee composed of two students, three faculty mem bers, two administrators, two alumni and four trustees. Mr. McIntyre will succeed Dr. Charles Vivier who resigned in March, along with Dr. James B. Kelley, vice president for academic affairs, and Dr. Daniel L. Bratton, vice president for student affairs. The board of trustees asked Dr. Vivier to reconsider his resignation, but he and his two aides refused, and on March 15 the trustees accepted their joint resignation. Dr. Vivier said at that time that the issue was “a very simple thing basically,” concern ing “The President's being able to direct and control the ad ministration for which he is responsible.” Mr. McIntyre, 46 years old, of Dix Hills, L. I., will be the eighth man to serve as Adel phi's chief executive officer and the third man to be acting president of the 8,000‐student university. He is a graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale Uni versity. He was a second lieu tenant in the United States Army Air Force, where he served as an aerial navigator. There are few students on the Adeiphi campus during the current between‐terms, recess, but the opinion of most of those remaining appeared to be that “one ‘establishment’ represent ative has been replaced by, an other.” It is now up to the sparch com mittee to select nominees for a permanent president. James T. Byrne Jr., the committee's chairman, said, “We will now address ourselves to complet ing our task as soon as pos sible.” Mr. McIntyre will serve full time in the meantime and will remain in his position as board chairman.

As books on foreign peoples go, the Irish win the quantity prize. Perhaps there's a big audience for them, perhaps writers know a set‐piece when they see one, perhaps the tax laws are inviting. Anyhow, here is another by veteran his torian Richard O'Connor (who has the name for it, although he also wrote “The German Americans”)., It's a good guide to the people, with endless ad vice on Irish hospitality, Irish drinking, Irish blarney. It's the kind of book that leads light headed reviewers to say, “Sure and it's a darlin’ place”—only that would be paddywhackery (a put‐on of super‐Irishness practiced by some of the natives and the Irish Tourist Bureau).

464-> Meany Scores Administration on Economic Policy
WASHINGTON, April 7 —George Meany, the president of the A.F.L.‐C.I.O., accused the Administration today of pursuing a “double standard” in its economic policies— one for labor and one for banks and big business. In a toughly worded statement to a Senate subcommittee, Mr. Meany characterized the Administration's economic policies as a “failure” and declared that organized labor “will not be the scapegoat for the economic mess created by this Administration's ill‐conceived ‘game plan.’” The labor leader charged Arthur F. Burns, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and “much of the Administration's leadership” with a “shocking and blatant use of the double standard.” “To cover their record of failure in economic policy, with its tragic consequences for millions of American families, they try to pin the blame on workers while providing subsidies and aid for the banks and big business.” Mr. Meany was testifying before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on bill to extend until 1973 Presidential authority to stabilize wages and prices. He repeated the willingness of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations to cooperate with wage and price controls if deemed necessary by the President, provided the controls are “even‐handed, across the board on all costs, prices, rents and incomes — including profits, dividends, interests and executive compensation.” However, Mr. Meany assailed President Nixon's decision to apply “wage restraints” on the construction industry. “Such a measure smacks of punitive action rather than a stabilization policy,” he said. Last month, the President ordered the creation of stabilization boards for the construction industry and set “criteria” that would keep wage increases in the industry at approximately 6 per cent a year. Criteria for stabilizing prices in the industry were to be established at a later date under the order. Mr. Meany asserted today that it was impossible to single out one industry such as construction to stabilize prices. He noted that several days after the President had issued his order stabilizing wages in construction the Labor Department announced that the wholesale price of building materials rose in March. “The costs and prices of the construction industry cannot be isolated from the price pressures in the rest of the economy,” he stated. “The time is long overdue,” Mr. Meany said, “for the Administration to stop playing with misguided ‘game plans’ and take the necessary steps to restore the economy to health.” As an example of the Administration's “double standard” he cited the stepped up depreciation rate to business which, he said, would cut corporation taxes by $3‐billion to $4‐billion a year while denouncing as inflationary increases in workers’ wages designed to offset inflation. He also said that sharp increases in bank profits and bankers’ salaries, soaring land costs and financing charges and deferred taxes on profits from exports are examples of the double standard. Mr. Meany made a particularly biting attack on Mr. Burns. Referring to suggestions about wage controls by the Federal Reserve chairman, he said, “Arthur Burns is the architect of the colossal failure of this economy—it is his plan, he told me so. Now Arthur Burns is becoming an expert on labor relations.” Another witness today. Representative Henry S. Reuss, Democrat of Wisconsin, said that the President should “impose an across‐the‐board freeze on wages, prices, salaries,” until a permanent voluntary price‐wage incomes policy is agreed on. Mr. Reuss said that a temporary wage‐price freeze would not only come to grips with inflation, it would also be effective in dealing with the recession and unemployment — “the other horn of our economic dilemma.”

465-> South Vietnamese Troops Reach Supply Trail in Laos, but Are Shelled by the Enemy
SAIGON, South Vietnam, Mon day, Feb. 15—An Air Force plane accidentally bombed “a friendly unit” yesterday morn ing near the United States‐sup ported base at Long Tieng in Laos, the military command here announced today. Official sources said the plane appeared to have released its bombs short of the intended target. The base has been un der enemy rocket attack for several days and United States aircraft are supporting the Lao tian irregulars who operate from Long Tieng with the back ing of the Central Intelligence Agency. Reports from Long Tieng said that the bombs had dropped on the C.I.A. base itself and dam aged its airstrip, but the com mand spokesman here said that the site of the bombing was about six miles north of Long Tieng. No report of casu alties was given. Long Tieng is just southwest of the Plaine des Jarres, where, in the dry season, North Viet namese troops annually ad vance toward the Laotian capi tal of Vientiane. It is well north of the south ern Laotian panhandle area where 12,000 South Vietnamese troops are advancing on North Vietnamese supply routes, and where United States helicopters helping the advance are en countering heavy ground fire. Yesterday afternoon one of these helicopters was shot down over Laos and three crewmen were wounded, the command announced this morn ing, bringing to eight the total of United States helicopters lost in Laos since the South Vietnamese operation began last Monday. The command also said that an Air Force F‐105 fighter bomber on a bombing mission in Laos fired a Shrike air‐to ground missile yesterday after noon at a North Vietnamese radar‐controlled antiaircraft po sition situated 19 miles south west of the city of Donghoi in North Vietnam. The aircraft was not dam aged, but was conducting what the command calls “protective reaction against hostile ac tions” by shooting at antiair craft positions when they are detected locking their guidance radar onto United States air craft. Early yesterday, enemy gunners reportedly fired 25 rockets at Dongha, near the nerve cen ter of the South Vietnamese sweep into Laos. The South Vietnamese com mand post at the Dongha com bat base was not hit, the mill tary, command in Saigon said, but one civilian was reported killed and seven wounded in the city nearby. Meanwhile, an authoritative American military source re ported that in addition to the 14 United States helicopters lost in the Laotian operation since Jan. 30 in both South Vietnam and Laos, 37 United States helicopters downed by North Vietnamese batteries had been recovered and could be repaired. The South Vietnamese mili tary spokesman reported that the situation in the over‐all, Laotian operation had changed little over the last few days. “The deepest point of our ad vance into Laos is now around 20 kilometers [12 miles] east of Tchepone,” the military spokesman said. Vietnamese troops have so far killed 262 enemy soldiers in the area and have suffered 38 deaths and 129 wounded, the command said. Tchepone, a key road junc tion, is about 25 air miles from the South Vietnamese border, but farther by the winding, dusty trace of the French colo nial Route 9 that the Vietnam ese are following. They have been inching to ward Tchepone since the bor der crossing last Monday, have crossed camouflaged sections of the Ho Chi Minh Trail net I work and have discovered sup ply caches, including one con taining more than 30,000 gal lons of gasoline. On Saturday, North Vietnam ese gunners fired at an un specified South Vietnamese ar tillery base in Laos, inflicting what the military command here called “light” casualties about 12 miles inside the bor der. In scattered actions since then, Vietnamese troops in Laos have killed 16 enemy soldiers and captured six while suffer ing light casualties, the com mand here said. The U.S. military command has disclosed part of the full extent of its massive air sup port of the South Vietnamese operation, saying that a total of 4,500 helicopter flights have carried Vietnamese troops into Laos, provided air cover for them, and resupplied them since the border crossing. Small bombers and B‐52's have also flown missions over Laos, but the command has not disclosed how many. Because of heavy antiaircraft fire north of the main advance along Route 9, a total of eight, United States helicopters have been lost in the operation in Laos since then, according to the command's figures, and six have been shot, down in South Vietnam. Saigon has reported that two South Vietnamese helicopters have been lost over Laos, but military sources here say that actually seven have gone down. One of the helicopters that was reported lost crashed on Wednesday with four photog raphers aboard. At the end of the first full week of the South Vietnamese operations in Laos, their inten tions and future targets are still unclear. The dry season in Laos will end in May and the dusty roads will become quagmires. Resistance has been light on the South Vietnamese side of the border, surprisingly so in view of allied intelligence re ports that thousands of North Vietnamese troops were in the hills in the western part of Quangtri Province before the operation started from the Quangtri combat base on Jan. 30. But it has been picking up in the last few days, with shell ing attacks and ambushes on Route 9 leading to Khesanh and the Laotian border. This route and the helicopter base at Khesanh, which has not been attacked since it was re occupied at the end of last month, are vital to the support of the extensive South Viet namese operations in Laos.

467-> STOCKS RETREAT IN SLOW TRADING
The stock market greeted Phase Two of President Nixon's economic program yesterday by wobbling to another 1971 low. The initial phase had expired over the weekend. Opening slightly higher, the Dow‐Jones industrial average gave ground steadily to close with a decline of 2.41 points at 810.53. It was the third trading day in succession that saw the blue‐chip average drop to its poorest finish of the year. Some Wall Streeters noted that the current setback‐140 points since the Dow topped out at 950.82 on April 28—represented the fourth biggest sustained loss of the last decade, as measured by point totals. The only previous declines of greater magnitude during this period occurred in 1962, 1966 and in the extended bear market of 1969‐70. Volume limped along yesterday at a very slow pace, falling to 9.4 million shares from Friday's 14.5 million shares. This sluggish turnover reflected the general apathy of investors, both big and small, during a prolonged period of confusion and doubt. The market's basic trouble was that it opened a new week with the key problems of the old week eminently unresolved. The main problems are the wage‐and‐price confusion surrounding Phase Two and the doubts raised by the international monetary situation. Wrapping a ribbon around these problems is the tight bind of tax‐loss selling. On Wall Street, the consensus shaped up something like this: the market probably is, going to move lower over the near term; find a bottom some place, and then rally. At one leading investment concern, there were analysts who envisaged the Dow industrials perhaps bottoming out between 775 and 800 before the end of next week. On the active, list, a handful of issues managed to post fractional gains. American Telephone ranked as the volume leader. It stood unchanged at, 42¼ Natomas, plunging 6⅜ to 51⅝, was the biggest loser among actively traded stocks. It set a yearly low that compared with the 1971 peak price of 101⅜. Some brokers pinned on Natomas one of the currently popular tags for a stock When it tumbles—“disappointing earnings.” Similarly, Becton, Dickinson fell 1⅜ to 28 after reporting a drop in fiscal‐year profit last week. It also set one of the Big Board's 102 lows in the process. First National City Corporation. rising ½ to 43½ in brisk trading, ranked among the five 1971 highs of the session. City Bank has gained more of an institutional following in recent weeks, thanks to its commitment to increasing earnings‐pershare growth. Caterpillar Tractor, down 1½ to 41⅞ as the second most active issue, made a yearly low. This is one of numerous stocks that have felt institutional selling pressure lately. Computer Sciences slipped ⅝ to 6½, closing within ⅛ of its yearly low. Only last week, it edged up ⅛ to score the only gain among the exchange's 20 most active issues. ‘Technical’ Decline The New York Times combined average dropped 4.38 points to 492.47. Technical analysts, pointing to the tally of 568 advances and 785 declines, spoke of the market's “continued technical deterioration.” Procter & Gamble, notching a new high, climbed 1⅜ to 75½. General Motors added ⅝ to 75 on the active list. After the closing bell yesterday, some observers mulled over the meaning of President Nixon's remarks at his news conference last Friday at the White House. A reported had asked, “What is your counsel today to the American investor?” The President replied: “Don't sell.”

470-> Art
HREE days hence, on May 5, the Museum of Modern Art will open an exhibition devoted to multiple works of art—not only prints but also three‐ dimensional molded and as sembled objects—produced in the California workshop en terprise known as Gemini G.E.L. (Graphic Editions Lim ited). The artists represented in the exhibition are not ex actly undiscovered: Josef Al bers, John Chamberlain, Ron Davis, Jasper Johns, Donald Judd, Ellsworth Kelly, Ed ward Kienholz, Roy Lichten stein, Claes Oldenburg, Ken Price, Robert Rauschenberg and Frank Stella. Whatever audacities Gemini G.E.L. may have ventured in the realm of technical production—and clearly, this workshop has already made an important contribution to the advance ment of the “multiples” in dustry—it is not in the busi ness of ferreting out new talent. This is an enterprise strictly circumscribed by an interest in highly salable commodities that bear the names of very well known or very well‐connected artists. To mark the occasion of this show, the Museum of Modern Art is publishing (or should one say producing?) some thing of its own. The ques tion is, what? Is it a catalog? A book? An object? a game? A multiple work of art? A sales brochure? A Jasper Johns coloring book? What ever it is—and it is surely something of all of these— it is solemnly entitled “Tech nics and Creativity,” and for the next two months you can buy it for $7.95. After July 6, the price goes to $10. * At this writing, the exhibi tion is not yet available for review, but the catalog‐ob ject‐coloring book‐sales bro chure called “Technics and Creativity” is, and I think it constitutes in itself a phe nomenon worth pondering. It is “in some respects” far more significant than the work it is designed both to illuminate and (in every sense of the word) sell. After all, the presence in the museum of these printed and molded multiples offers us a paradox easily disposed of. You might think that these multiples, by their very existence, had ren dered museum display super erogatory, if not obsolete, but you would be wrong. For no matter how large the number of multiples Gemini produces, we are still talking about ex pensive art objects created to attain a certain standard of esthetic quality, and this alone is sufficient reason nowadays to consider them potential exhibition material. The catalog‐object‐combine is something else. With this production, we fare a para dox of another sorf. The work consists of four parts: A white plastic case which contains a specially commissioned (and deliherately unfinished) multiple by Jasper Johns, a rectangular piece of pure white Styro foam, and a handsomely illus trated take‐out text by Riva Castleman, associate curator of prints and illustrated books at the museum. The multiple by Mr. Johns, which might be called a multiple within‐a‐multiple, represents something new both in the multiple business and (I think) in the museum busi ness. This is how the mu seum's own statement de scribes it: “The multiple, which can be removed from the case, is a two‐color offset lithograph with a collage of three wells of watercolor paint and a brush. The multi ple invites the purchaser to collaborate with Jasper Johns in creating his own version of ‘Target 1970.’” Actually, in the sample I have at hand, it is impossible to remove the Johns multiple from the case without damaging it. One does not need to remove the work, of course, to enter into this rare opportunity to col laborate with a world‐famous artist, though I suppose if you were satisfied that your own contribution had come off well enough, you might want to hang the finished work on the wall, and to do that you might have a prob lem. Oh well, no break through is ever entirely with out its flaws. By the way, the design of the lithograph indi cates places for two signa tures—Mr. Johns's already af fixed, and your very own. * The triviality of this gim mick is not to be taken on faith; it must be seen to be believed. The triviality of this requires a context of absolute solemnity to be marketable, and this is the function of Miss Castleman's text, which, in style, tone and content, re sembles nothing so much as one of those profiles of a bright new successful cor poration one finds in Fortune Magazine. It is one of those texts that belongs less to the history of art than to the his tory of marketing, and as a promotional writer Miss Cas tleman is right up there with the best of them—a true be liever whose faith in the pro duct and in the spiritual des tiny of the company never flags. This text, together with the entire catalog‐object gimmick of which at is an essential part, does prompt some re flections on the whole multi ples phenomenon. First and foremost, it reminds us that multiples have so far at tained no independent artistic existence. Well‐known artists, mostly of the Pop or Color abstraction persuasion, have been invited to do their thing —in every case, a thing con ceptually perfected in an other medium—and the Gem ini technicians have been in genious in smoothing the way, but the thing itself is something already familiar to us as painting or sculpture or construction. What the Gem ini technicians make possible is a cheaper—but not all that cheap—version of an “image” (in the advertising sense) al ready on the art market. Then, too, only certain styles are susceptible to this sort of multiple production. It seems to me there is absolutely no reason—either esthetic or technical—why, say, the recent paintings of Frank Stella and Elisworth Kelly cannot be mechanically reproduced by the thousands, But there are, of course, com mercial reasons why such a practice is not observed. Finally, what makes the multiples phenomenon such a complete esthetic bore is that it remains so totally a co efficient of fashionable taste. All the technical ingenuity is designed to serve not new esthetic ideas but more and more rehearsals of ideas, styles and reputations that are already overfamiliar and overinflated. Technically, the work may be remarkable, but like a lot of other remarkable technological advances in our society, they are completely hostage to the whims and mechanisms and promotional adventurism of the market place. So now the museum joins in this gold rush, too, marketing its trivial little art game in the white plastic case. No wonder so many thoughtful people are wondering nowa days if our museums have any clear notion of what their function and their re sponsibilities really are.

If construction is authorized, a multimillion dollar plant would be in pro duction of dyes for textiles and, paper by late 1974. Currently all du Pont's dye production is concentrated at the Chambers Works at Deepwater, N. J. The company said produc tion would be continued there, since only part of its dye out put would be in Puerto Rico, where about 350 people would be employed.

473-> Letter to the Editor 4 ‐‐ No Title
To The Editor: Walter Kerr's criticism of “Follies” was almost totally devoted to the show's plot. Basically, what he says is that the plot is weak, and there is no one who can ar gue with him. But “Follies” is much more than its plot and it is disappointing that Kerr came away with such a myopic view of this mu sical. “Follies” is a total con cept and its plot is only one element of the concept. Ac tually, if the plot were strong and crystal clear (as Kerr would like it to have been), the concept would be un workable, particularly since it unites the present and the past with the world of fan tasy. If Kerr had been able to see the concept of “Follies,” perhaps he wouldn't have felt that the songs by the pros from the past were mere intrusions. Intrusions to the plot — yes! But they are absolutely essential to the concept. It appears that while Kerr saw some of the trees, he never managed to see the forest. New York.

474-> Treasury Widens Leeway In Judging ‘Dumping’ Cases
The Treasury Department said yesterday that it had abandoned its 25 per cent rule in determining whether a foreign manufacturer was “dumping” merchandise in this country. Dumping is selling a product abroad below the price charged in its country of origin. In the past the Treasury De partment could make a fair value determination only if more than 25 per cent of out put was sold for home con sumption by the exporter. The department said it may now make fair‐value determinations on the basis of domestic market prices even if the quantity of the merchandise sold for home consumption is less than 25 per cent of the total quantity sold.

475-> Italian Premier Bars Role for Reds
ROME, Feb. 14 — Premier Emilio Colombo, who will visit Washington for talks with President Nixon later this week, firmly ruled out today any possibility that the Com munist party might come to power in Italy. The Premier said in an inter view that Western fears about a possible drift toward Com munism here were “under standable though exaggerated.” Speaking informally after a recorded question‐and‐answer session, conducted in Italian, the 50 ‐ year ‐ old Premier quipped, “With all due respect for the experiences of other nations, we don't have to im port chili for our spaghetti.” This was an allusion to con cern voiced by commentators in the Western press that the Communist party might soon share government power in Italy in the same way that Communists are participating in the Government of President Salvador Allende Gossens in Chile. During the interview in his office in the Palazzo Chigi in Rome's center, the Premier conceded that the Italian Com munist party, the strongest in the West, was “a real force with deep roots in Italian society.” “For a complex of historical reasons, that party finds itself representing various strata of the people and ruling local administrations, especially in some regions where Socialist tradition was strong at the be ginning of the century,” he said. He was referring to Com munist control of many munici pal governments and the administration of three new semi‐autonomous regions— Emilia‐Romagna, Tuscany and Umbria. Nevertheless, he went on, “the model of development and international alignment that the Communist party pro poses for Italy—an industrially advanced country deeply em bedded in the Western area and with its own system of alliances—is the antithesis of what we propose and regard as valid. “I exclude [the possibility] that a government alliance be tween the democratic parties and the Italian Communist party may be created whereby the Communist party attains power.” He noted that the Italian Communist party, for which more than a fourth of the elec torate voted in recent elections, was now experiencing “strong challenges on the left and de fections while the contradic tions within the international Communist movement are be coming sharper.” “This is a harrowing process and we don't know where it all will end,” he continued. “We do know that a policy of accommodation would not make it easier for this process to reach positive results for Italian and European politics. On the contrary, full solidarity among the democratic parties making up the Government ma jority is an essential factor that can assure continuity for the development of democracy, a term of reference that even the Communist party cannot evade.” Thus, while warning that at present any deals with the Communist party must be avoided, Premier Colombo hinted that Italian Communism might evolve into something like a genuine opposition party that one day might even be trusted to abide by the rules of democracy. Asked about the indirect election later this year of new President of Italy, the Pre mier admitted that Communist votes might have a role in that choice. Anti‐Communists here warn that behind‐the‐scenes deals by presidential candidates with the Communist party may in crease its power. But Premier Colombo today cited past ex perience as proof that Commu nist support for a presidential candidate was not dangerous. “Judging by the past,” he said, “presidential elections in Italy have an irregular charac ter, meaning that coalitions that occur do not reflect the opposing positions that exist in our political life and do not later recur in it. Past experience teaches us that the alignment of Communist votes behind a candidate is not dangerous, be cause what counts most is the quality of the person who is elected, his prestige and the firmness of his democratic faith.” A left‐wing Christian Demo crat, Giovanni Gronchi, was elected President in 1955 with the help of Communists and served until 1962. Communist votes are believed to have played a role in other presiden tial elections. The seven‐year term of Presi dent Giuseppe Saragat, a Social Democrat, expires in December, and his re‐election, although theoretically possible, is con sidered unlikely. Under Italy's Constitution both houses of Parliament and representatives of Italy's 20 regions elect a new head of state in joint session. If the center‐left coalition supporting the Colombo Cabi net were able to agree on a candidate, election without Communist votes would be as sured. The Government alliance consists of Mr. Colombo's Christian Democrats and three smaller parties—the Socialist, Social Democratic and Republi can. There is already a galaxy of unannounced candidates for the Presidency, and some of them are believed to be eyeing the Communist votes in the Assembly. The Communist party recently served notice that it intended to bargain be fore deciding whom it would support. An unemotional bachelor, economist and advocate of Eu ropean integration, Mr. Colom bo has been Premier since Au gust. His administration took over at the height of an infla tionary crisis and has been suc cessful in strengthening the lira. President Nixon during a visit to Rome in October invited Mr. Colombo to come to the United States. The Premier is scheduled to start talks with President Nixon and other United States leaders in Wash ington on Thursday. Afterward he is to visit the space center and medical institutions in Houston. He is then to go to Boston and conclude his visit in New York next week. Today's interview reflected the absence of any major prob lems in the relations between Italy and the United States. Mr. Colombo stressed the close Italian‐American ties and said he intended to speak in Wash ington “as an Italian and as a European.” The Premier acknowledged that his Government was fac ing “difficulties” in maintain ing public order at home right now but said they should not be dramatized. He described Italian strains as a “crisis of growth” and hopefully pointed to the resilience of the Italian people and economy. Mr. Colombo strongly re stated his Government's com mitment to enacting broad structural reforms in such fields as housing, health serv ices, transportation and taxes. By eliminating injustices, the Premier said, the Government will ease tensions. “The reforms are the reason for the existence of this Gov ernment” the Premier asserted. “I have always said that the Government makes enactment of its program a condition for its remaining in charge.” The Premier, who comes from a middle‐class family in Potenza in Italy's underprivi leged south, emphasized that the development of that part of the country must be con sidered the nation's basic task in the nineteen‐seventies. He said that up to 80 per cent of all public investments would be channeled to southern Italy. Discussing foreign politics, the Premier said he hoped Italy's decision to exchange ambassadors with Communist China would contribute to lead ing Peking out of its isolation in the world. “We deeply believe in a peaceful international commu nity whose members are all able to respect one another,” Mr. Colombo said. “To respect one another they must know one another.” The Premier voiced support for the policy of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany of seeking better relations with Eastern Europe. But he stressed the continued need for Western solidarity in dealing with the East. Mr. Colombo, one of the ar chitects of European unification, expressed hope that the terms and timetable of Britains's en try into the European Common Market would be known by next summer. Asked to comment on rela tions between the United States and Italy, Mr. Colombo spoke of “so many historical and blood ties” and “a deep friend ship.” And he added: “The objective we must pur sue is to maintain these ties on the present level while convert ing them, together with the other factors, into the emerging relations between united Eu rope and the United States.”

477-> REPORT CRITICIZES HOUSING‐LAW USE
A city‐sponsored study of housing‐code enforcement, made public yesterday, found that many of the inspection, complaint and punishment pro cedures were “wasted effort” and that prosecution had “neg ligible” impact. The report was prepared by the Housing and Development Administration and the New York City Rand Institute. It recommended that enforcement of the Housing Maintenance Code be turned over entirely to the city. Violators of the code are now tried in Criminal Court, and the report supports a po sition long held by the city, and now under consideration in Albany, in the form of three proposals for legislation. Of the three competing bills, two — one sponsored by the city and another endorsed by Governor Rockefeller — would set up a special administra tive tribunal to take over the court's role. The third bill, which has bi partisan support in the As sembly, would shift the en forcement procedures to Civil Court. Albert A. Walsh, the city's Housing and Development Ad ministrator, has indicted a pref erence for the administrative tribunal method, but would ac cept the Civil Court proposal as better than no change at all. The 107‐page report found that it now took an average of 18 months to bring a land lord to trial for alleged viola tions. Fines averaged, the re port said, $12.62 in 1969, or $1 to $3 for each violation. The Housing Maintenance Code regulates safety features, plumbing, heating systems, ele vators and other aspects of 800,000 one‐ or two‐family houses and two million apart ments in 148,000 buildings. The city's budget for enforcement has quadrupled in six years. In May, 1969, there were vio lations against 9,1,000 of 148, 000 buildings, the report said, but the city had few details on which were hazardous and which were minor. The report said that a great deal of time was wasted trying to enforce the codes in build ings where the landlord simply had no money to make repairs. In such cases, the report said, punitive measures only made the problem worse. The report urged that the Of fice of Code Enforcement use variety of measures, such as taking over a building when failure to meet standards is clearly “a symptom of financial distress.” The city's ability to reduce rent in rent‐controlled buildings was found to be a more effec tive means of code enforce ment. The report said that, in three‐quarters of the cases, the threat of rent reduction has been sufficient to restore services. Few of the reduced rents are ever restored, however, indicat ing that rent reduction is more effective as a deterrent than as a punishment. The New York City Rand In stitute is an independent con cern whose directors include city officials and officers of the Rand. Corporation of Santa Monica, Calif.

478-> SULLIVAN LEADS AUBURN YICTORY
AUBURN, Ala., Oct. 2 (UPI) —Pat Sullivan passed for 253 yards and two touchdowns today as Auburn rolled to a 38‐6 victory over Kentucky. Sullivan hit 16 of 25 passes and ran for another 12 yards. Nine of his passes went to Terry Beasley, who gained 194 yards and scored a touchdown. Beasley's touchdown catch in the first quarter—on a 59‐yard pass from Sullivan — set a Southeastern Conference record of 19 career touchdown receptions. The record of 18 had been held by Dennis Homan of Alabama. Sullivan threw 6 yards to Dick Schmalz for another score. James Owens scored on a 6‐yard run and Tommy Lowery plunged 1 yard for another. Gardner Jett hit on a 37‐yard field goal and five extra points. A reserve quarterback, Ted Smith, hit Robbie Robinett with a 7‐yard pass to complete the rout for Coach Shug Jordan's Tigers. Auburn enjoyed a 24‐0 lead before Kentucky got its score in the third period on a 1‐yard plunge by Gary Knutson that completed a 75‐yard drive directed by Bernie Scruggs. A pass by Scruggs for two points was incomplete. Jett's field goat was the 11th straight without a miss, establishing another S.E.C. record. One bright spot for Kentucky was the play of its cornerback, Jeff Woodcock, who intercepted two Sullivan passes and knocked down two more in the secondary. Johnny Simmons, Mike Neel and Dave Lyons each intercepted a Scruggs pass for Auburn A sophomore tackle, Benny Snivley, anchored the Auburn defensive line and made six individual tackles. The loss dropped Kentucky's won‐lost record to 1‐3 for the season. Auburn kept its record clean at 3‐0. ??

479-> U.S. URGED TO PUSH ENVIRONMENT AID
WASHINGTON, July 6—The policy‐making body of the Na tional Science Foundation has told the White House that the United States needs a compre hensive national research pro gram to help man understand and cope with his increasing effects on world environment. The Federal Government should have major responsibil ity for this program, the Na tional Science Board said in its third annual report to the Presi dent. It said that science and technology today were not ca pable of understanding fully what man was doing to his world. “The situation constitutes a crisis for the nation,” the re port said. The board recotmended that the Federal Government accept sweeping responsibility that would involve setting policies, priorities and levels of support for research and the training of manpower. The board rejected the notion that action to protect the en vironment should be deferred until all scientific questions were answered. It said, how ever, that there was a clear and urgent need to set up a national program to develop the envir onmental sciences to the point where they could provide needed Information and predic tion of effects. Emphasis in the proposed national effort should be on problems in the middle‐size scale—lakes, estuaries, urban areas, regional weather systems and oceanic fisheries, the re port indicated. But the board said the effort must not lag in dealing with problems on global scale. “In the long run,” the report said, “it is the global con straints that will shape and de limit the future development of civilization.” The National Science Founda tion, a Government agency, plays a major role in support of basic scientific research throughout the nation. Its Na tional Science Board consists of the director of the founda tion and 24 members appointed to six‐year terms by the Presi dent. They are all prominent figures in science, education or business. The board's annual reports to the President are intended to appraise the status of health and science in the United States. President Nixon trans mitted this year's report to Congress just before the holiday weekend. The report said that present manpower and financial sup port of the environmental sci ences were inadequate. Envi ronmental science was defined broadly to include the broad range of disciplines involved in studying all the systems of air, land, water, energy and life that surround man. Efforts to foresee and cope with environmental change are severely limited by the present level of understanding of the way the environment behaves, the board declared. Yet man's unwitting impact on the en vironment is increasing rapidly, it said. The use of energy and the processing of material by man are doubling every 14 years, the report said. “Correspondingly,” it said, “the number and severity of environmental problems will increase, while the adequacy of ad hoc piecemeal expedients will decrease.” The board forecast that as population and the artifacts of civilization grew, the human losses from natural disasters would increase. It said these were already great. “At the same time,” the re port said; “the intensification of man's needs for both re newable and nonrenewable re sources requires even greater manipulation and mastery of the natural and man‐made sys tems that constitute the en vironment.” In the board's view, the problems to he solved are broader, more difficult and more dependent on the coordi nated use of the scientific re sources than those the nation faced in harnessing the atom, developing radar or exploring space.

480-> It's a Champagne Bubble on the Breeze
THERE is one entrancing moment, among many, in Paul Sills's im provisational leafing of Ovid's “Metamorphoses,” now alternat ing with the successful “Story Theater” at the Ambassador, in which a very wifely wife dies happily. She is the mate of Cephalus, that phenomenally fortunate hunter whose spear not only unerringly lances its prey but instantly returns to him with its powers intact. Both she and he have cause to lament the spear. It has, Cephalus tells us early, utterly ruined his marriage, and that is no doubt the understatement of the con. Ruined his marriage? It has run his wife clear through, terminating their association once and for all. She has, you see, suspected her hunter‐husband of having an affair with Zephyr and she has spied on him from the bushes, where he has mistaken her for fair game. Now she lies in his arms, breath ing her jealous last. But he is able to reassure her, so that she can go to the netherworld with a forgiving smile on her lips. Zephyr, he explains, was only a breeze. The evening, too, is only a breeze, making everyone quite happy, and that may be the secret of Mr. Sills's suc cess where so many others have stumbled, or arrived at only middling pleasure, with the same sort of styling. The deeply engaging quality of the mixed bag of mime, dance, low joke and song that distinguishes “Story Theater” and “Metamorphoses” (I prefer “Metamorphoses” but won't argue the point) does need some explaining. After all, the young performers who chase nymphs and catch them straight from the Golden Age to the Iron aren't, in dividually, better dancers than real dancers are, better mimes than Marceau, better clowns than Broadway spawns, better singers than the folk folk whose records you buy. Tomorrow, McAlpin Rooftop Theater, 7. A play by Rod Parker. Wednesday, Billy Rose, 7. A country rock musical by C. C. and Ragan Courtney and Peter Link. Thursday, St. James Thea ter, 7:15. A play by Archibald Mac Leish. Starring Patrick Magee, Will Geer, Roy Poole and Will Mackenzie. What makes them, then, so much more appealing in sum than their coun terparts who keep springing up on campuses and in cabarets? Last year, for instance, I saw the Yale University Theater's company do a “Metamor phoses,” inspired by Sills's work but not supervised by him personally, in which the persistent misbehavior of the gods became a too readily antici pated and too perfunctorily disposed‐of business, generating not much more than the thin snicker of a Latin student discovering that the classics department had a gossip column of its own. (Though I do remember with pleasure a Pyg malion earnestly blowing away the marble dust between Galatea's just chiseled toes.) And in New York the Public Theater has recently been playing host to a Chicago troupe improvising around and about and then far, far away from Voltaire's “Candide.” (If there weren't a paint‐splattered banner overhead pro nouncing this “the best of all possible worlds,” I doubt that you'd guess from the entertainment what Pangloss's un reliable philosophy was.) The “Can dide” clowns, with their pale faces and sunflower eyes, seem likable kids. But their invention runs to this sort of thing. While an ingénue is trying to get a speech made, other members of the troupe wander through the audience munching popcorn loudly, so loudly that she retires in a pet behind a draw‐cur tain and refuses to proceed until they —and the audience—say, “I'm sorry.” The members of the audience are now forced to say, “I'm sorry,” to get the lass back again, and, being obliging, they do. But they have been coerced into a conceit, cooperating on an in‐joke that has more to do with “Peter Pan” than Voltaire, and they feel a bit sheepish, somewhat had, as they beg. They don't really care very much whether that reluctant girl gets her speech, out. Nothing like that at “Met amorphoses.” What func tions so savingly here, I think, is the grace that comes of restraint, of never com ing on too cute or pretend ing to too much. There is a poetry about the evening, but a modest poetry, settling for something lower than the stars and less demanding than the wind. When guitar ist Hamid Hamilton Camp, functioning sometimes as narrator when the harps and viols behind him are quiet and sometimes as Jove when he is needed in the thick of things, moves gently before the leaf‐drenched cyclorama to sing of the birth of the earth or of the loss of the Golden Age (“After the Gold en Age, spring came only once a year”), we are in pos session of echoes that do seem to go back to the time when Aurora came over the horizon in a golden glow, but portentous about it. Aurora must have been charming, we think; and possibly ap proachable. Sure enough, when she does rise in the east, directly out of the or chestra pit, she is no mere legendary creature, no lyri cist's awed whim. She is, in the daytime, what night was made for, and first thing you know she and Procris are locked in a 60‐day embrace, Procris protesting he is mar ried the whole while. What Is poetic is easy and sly, what is low is cunning but very sparingly touched upon. When Jove, bearded and clad in a thigh‐garment that gives his hip bones am ple play, stalks down from the heavens to introduce himself to Io, he pauses to make an announcement: “I don't have a drop of human in me.” He needn't say more (it would only spoil the laugh); and he doesn't. We understand his credentials; and his intentions, too. When Mars marches into Vulcan's busy forge to order not only, a shield but a matching two‐ edged sword (while eyeing Vulcan's wife, who not only looks like Venus but is), he doesn't press the contempo rary shop talk beyond “matching.” He doesn't need to. This company, like its adapter‐lyricist Arnold Weinstein, always knows when to cut off, to pull back smiling; it plays tag with the audience, and stays friends. Some of the dancing is genuinely skilled, notably that of Paula Kelly, a dark skinned Europa who, having been fetched from Africa by that visiting bull, contents herself as the lights fade with reminding us that we never did know, did we, that our civilization was named after her. Some of the mim ing is impeccably profession al, particularly Paul Sand's, though he has less to do here than in “Story Theater.” (The company is a true ensemble, and Mr. Sand should no doubt be kept in focus; but why waste inspiration?) In “Metamorphoses” it seems as though all of the girls were beautiful, a bless ing partly arranged for us by the exquisite costuming of Noel Taylor. (If you want to know what sensuality is, don't waste your time on the likes of “Oh! Calcutta!”, watch Penny White leap from the forest as the hunt ress Diana, Mary Frann ac quire a smile as she slowly warms to her sculptor's ar dor, Valerie Harper thrust a determined knee through her red and tan gauzeries as a suspicious Juno goes on earthly prowl.) The second half of the en tertainment winds down some; it's always a question just how long separate snatches of material, no mat ter how choice, can keep from becoming repetitively built. But the evening is a champagne bubble nonethe less—drifting, popping quiet ly, promising warmth through a cool control, de ceptively suave, easy and animated and ever so social.

481-> Housing Starts Seen High for' 72
MIAMI BEACH, Nov. 15— Housing experts in the government and private sector agreed today that production of shelter for American families next year would continue the surprising showing of 1971. They were less in agreement on what would happen to mortgage rates in 1972. But even uncertainty over that key factor did not deter them from predicting that the now‐assured total of 2 million housing starts this year would be exceeded in the year to come. “I have no doubt that there'll be at least 2.1 or 2.2 million dwelling units started. in 1972,” Woodward Kingman, president of the Government National Mortgage Association, told members of the National Association of Real Estate Boards at their 64th annual convention here today. Mr. Kingman was one of a half‐dozen Government officials, members of Congress and representatives of the private mortgage industry who spoke to the 9,000 realty men attending the week‐long session at the Fontainebleau and other hotels. Basis of Prediction The prediction of continued high housing production was based by Mr. Kingman on his aisumption that the backlog of demand developed through the long period of credit stringency together with a period of relatively plentiful mortgage money in the next 12 months would produce sustained housing production, Easier and cheaper credit, he said, should result. if the psychology of the marketplace is favorably affected by Phase Two of the Nixon Administration's economic plan. “Investors will become more confident that the dollar will not be further eroded, and that will be the main factor in bring ing down interest rates,” he said. Philip C. Jackson Jr., president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, agreed that interest rates may well continue their present downward drift. But even if in actuality, they should hold firm or rise, he said, housing need not be as hard hit as it has been historically in times of tight money. Mr. Jackson, a Birmingham, Ala., mortgage banker, pointed out that the number of Government subsidy programs seeking to alleviate the housing shortage had proliferated in the last two years. In this connection, he criticized the present basic subsidy programs as being improperly oriented and argued instead for Federally funded housing allowances that would go directly to families in need of better shelter. The mortgage bankers have proposed an expansion of the present small, experimental Federal housing allowance program. The broader arrangement would transmit to a low‐income family a housing allowance certificate that could be used—in the manner food stamps are used—to buy or rent shelter of the family's choice. The president of the Federal National Mortgage Association, Oakley Hunter, was more pessimistic about the prospects for holding down interest rates on Government‐backed home loans now at a 7 per cent annual rate. The general level of interest rates might well rise in 1972, but there should still be “no severe pressure on the mortgage market,” he said.

482-> Unbeaten Alabama Hopes Winning Tide Will Sweep Team Into Orange Bowl
Paul (Bear) Bryant's 1966 Alabama football team was certainly the most frustrated team he coached, if not the best. Though undefeated in 10 regular‐season games, that Crimson Tide, with such stars as Ray Perkins at end, re mained in the shadow of Notre Dame and Michigan State, who finished undefeated but tied after their historic 10‐10 strug gle. Once again Bryant's power ful 'Bama Tide is going along undefeated after notching vic tory No. 8 with a 41‐10 romp over Mississippi State Satur day night. Once again Ala bama is trailing in the weekly national popularity contest as Nebraska and Oklahoma head toward their Thanksgiving Day confrontation. Michigan, also undefeated, is wedged in there between the unbeaten Big Eight powers and Alabama in the opinions of some experts. standings But this time Alabama, with such stars as Johnny Musso, the running back, may not end up as frustrated as the 1966 Tide. The way things are going, Alabama could reach the Or ange Bowl and settle the No. 1 question against either Nebras ka or Oklahoma. There are some who feel Bryant may now have the strongest team he has produced in 27 years as a head coach (14 at Ala bama). Sam Bailey, Bryant's No. 1 assistant, said yesterday, “We'd sure love that Orange Bowl shot. But each week things will get tougher here. But that chance would be a great one for us to show our selves.” Alabama's 1966 team trounced Nebraska, 34‐7, in the Sugar Bowl, but remained No. 3 in the land. Notre Dame didn't go to bowls in those days. Michigan State, as a Big Ten team, couldn't go to a bowl with Alabama. Nebraska was below 'Bama in the rank ings. Alabama has its own regu lar‐season showdowns coming up before it can count bowl marbles. The Tide's big game will probably be against Au burn on Nov. 27. Both Southeast ern Conference teams may be undefeated when they meet. Auburn's Pat Sullivan passed the Tigers to their seventh tri umph, a 40‐7 decision over Florida, Saturday. Alabama must play Louisi ana State this week. The Tigers of Baton Rouge were shocked Saturday, losing their first S.E.C. game in two years, to Mississippi, 24‐22. Alabama and Auburn kept stride with all the other major undefeated teams as expected Saturday, as Oklahoma trounced Iowa State, 43‐12; Nebraska stopped Colorado, 31‐7; Michigan poured it on In diana, 61‐7; Penn State turned back West Virginia, 35‐7; Geor gia beat South Carolina, 24‐0; Toledo defeated Miami of Ohio, 45‐6; Dartmouth edged Yale; 17‐15, and Cornell beat Colum bia, 24‐21. Field goals settled the Dart mouth and Cornell Ivy League battles to keep these teams tied for the league lead. But Ed Marinaro's 272 yards for a ma jor college career record of 4,132 yards rushing was the big event in the Ivy League as the Cornell tailback set many rec ords. Eric Allen also set a one game college record of 350 yards running as he led Michi gan State to a 43‐10 victory over Purdue. This year of the runner, had some other displays of notable footwork Saturday. For in stance, Paul Loughran ran back a punt 71 yards for a touch down to give Temple a 32‐27 upset of previously unbeaten Delaware. The Temple fullback gained a total of 306 yards. The biggest surprise of the day came at Little Rock, Ark., where Texas A. and M. beat Arkansas, 17‐9. That Southwest Conference game, mixed up the Cotton Bowl picture as four teams in the league have only one loss each. The Southwest champion is Cotton Bowl host team. The play that resulted In Penn's fourth touchdown against Harvard Saturday was incorrectly reported in The New York Times. The Quakers scored on a 76‐yard pass play, with Mark Mandel throwing to Don Clune. Gary Shue, the quarter back, lateraled back to Mandel, who threw to Clune.

483-> Television
AFTER you've wowed them with “The Forsyte Saga,” what do you do for an encore? The answer, at least for the Public Broadcast ing Service, is “Masterpiece Theater.” The Galsworthy series had garnered a relatively large and steady audience for Public Broadcasting. WGBH, Public Television's arm in Boston, then was faced with the problem of finding some way to maintain that audience, hoping that eventually it might start tuning in earlier or hanging on later to sample other programs on Public Television. Such are the machinations employed in the popular television sweepstakes of “Building an Audience.” There were only two hurdles: Finding good material, and finding someone to pick up the bill. As it happened, the material was there for the acquiring from the same source that provided “The Forsyte Saga”—the British Broad casting Corporation and a backlog of impressive serializations presented un der its Classics Series banner. The financing was arranged by Stan ford Calderwood, president of WGBH at the time, who got Mobil Oil Corpor ation to make a commitment of about $1‐million. A quarter of the grant was pegged for “Sesame Street,” with the rest going to “Masterpiece Theater.” Christopher Sarson, a young producer for WGBH, headed a screening delega tion that spent long sessions in dim London studios and, eventually, four series were selected for the first go round: “The First Churchills,” “The Spoils of Poynton,” “The Possessed” and “Père Goriot.” For many American viewers the pro grams have been revelations on the potential of television to combine in telligence with solid entertainment. Ex cellent adaptations, superb acting and a remarkable fidelity to the mood or atmosphere of the particular work have inevitably prompted questions as to why American television stations have n't attempted similar projects. Well, of course, they have but, as in the recent pallid production of “Jane Eyre,” the re sults haven't been nearly so rewarding. Somehow the British seem to have developed a special knack for recreating the classics—without superstars, with out terribly elaborate productions, with out dull pretentiousness. “The Spoils of Poynton” is probably the most successful dramatization of what Joseph Conrad termed the “delicacy and tenuity” that permeates the world of Henry James. And in “The Possessed,” which begins tonight with the first of six weekly instalments, the intensely emotional arena of Dostoevski is brought expertly to soulful life. * The Russian novel, with subplots within subplots and dealing with every thing from revolution and crime to reli gion and atheism, doesn't lend itself to easy adaptation. Published in serial form in the early 1870's, the melodramatic work represented a Dostoevski polemic against the naive revolutionary forces of the time, forces the author consid ered demonic. What with murders, deaths, suicides, riots, duels and in trigues, the list of horrors in “The Pos sessed” is a record even for Dostoevski. In the opening paragraphs of the novel, Dostoevski refers to “Gulliver's Travels,” and there is a good deal of Swiftian satire in “The Possessed.” Hugh Leonard's dramatization and Naomi Capon's direction retain much of this, the various segments sprinkled with incessant Russian ruminations on “the meaning of it all,” with passionate declarations of love followed almost im mediately by equally passionate dec larations of hate. In the fourth segment there is an especially delicious glimpse of a meet ing of the town radicals. After speeches an birthday celebrations as mere su perstitions and on the various suffer ings of students, the proceedings dis integrate into chaos and finally the meeting is asked to vote on the ques tion of whether or not it is in fact having a meeting. Throughout the complex develop ments, there is a steady focus on two main groups of characters. The older ones, generally seen as useless liberals by Dostoevski, are typified by Stepan Verkhovensky, elderly teacher and Old Left radical, and his patroness, Var vara Stavrogin. For 20 years these two have been acting out their odd rela tionship, she reprimanding that “you are a stylist, not a friend,” he never theless insisting that “I shall worship you disinterestedly.” The younger ones are led by Stepan's son, Peter, and Varvara's son, Nikolai. Of all the characters, Peter comes closest to being the compleat villain, a totally unscrupulous manipulator, im pressed only with the young Nikolai Stavrogin, whom he wants to use as a figurehead for his revolution. The handsome Nikolai, on the other hand, is a more complex creation, that favorite Dostoevski creature of objective non commitment. Veering between vice and virtue, kindness and brutality, he is com mitted to no theory, no moral code, and for him everything paradoxically becomes permissible. The acting throughout is predictably splendid. Peter is played by David Col lings, who has been seen in the films “A Man for All Seasons” and “Scrooge.” Nikolai is Keith Bell, out of repertory theater in Liverpool and films that include Maximilian Schell's “First Love.” Joseph O'Conor, seen in “The Forsyte Saga,” turns the elderly Stepan into an endearing figure of pompous dignity, and Rosalie Crutch ley's Mme. Stavrogin is a magnificent rock of instant contradictions. As in the other produc tions Shown on “Masterpiece Theater,” each segment of this one Will be introduced by Alistair Cooke, who will provide the viewer with guidelines and plot summaries for getting through the maze of characters and events, in this case somewhat denser than usual. This additional material for American viewers was over seen by producer Sarson, who left England nearly 10 years ago with a background in music studies at Cam bridge University and work ing experience In British tel evision. In Boston for the past few years, Sarson has extend ed an interest in music on television to Children's pro graming and, of course, to drama. Sarson is adamant about one aspect of “Masterpiece Theater.” He does not con ceive of it as a special offer ing for a limited “literary” audience. His aim is to ac quire properties with the highest potential for popular appeal. His emphasis is on good stories that are well done, and, so far at least, his selections definitely meet those criteria. They also seem to be at tracting a good‐sized audi ence, a fact that isn't being ignored by the commercial networks. The Columbia Broadcasting System recent ly acquired the rights to the BBC's six‐part series on “The Six Wives of henry VIII,” starring Keith Michell as Henry. The 90‐minute pro grams will be shown in prime time this August and Sep tember. As for the future of “Mas terpiece Theater,” Sarson is confident that there will be a lot more to came. Mobil appears to be pleased with the results, and Sarson, is turn, praises Mobil's support for the total absence of any policy‐making strings. While future schedules have not been set, Sarson notes in passing that he has found several other series especial ly interesting — among oth ers, Jane Austen's “Sense and Sensibility,” Thomas Hardy's “Jude the Obscure” and Al dous Huxley's “Point Counter Point.” Happily, in the ease of “Masterpiece Theater,” there seems to be no end in sight.

To the Editor: Liberty as the heart of America, for it is the framework in which we may struggle to a larger economic, political and social democracy. Now it has won a round; the Supreme Court has cleared a smokescreen of repression. But the battle goes on. Eisenhower's warning of the “military‐industrial complex” is now compounded by this Administration's continuing attack on the First Amendment freedoms. And if “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,” Patrick Henry's “Give me liberty or give me death!” must be our watchword. Nor is there a better way to observe that vigilance than to practice those great freedoms—to support the free dom of our media, to write and speak out, to peaceably assemble, and to petition our Government for a redress of grievances. Far Rockaway, N.Y., June 30, 1971

487-> Pop
Is IT significant that Andy Warhol—Lord High Pooh Bah of Pop Art in the sixties — was chosen to do the cover art for the new Rolling Stones album? Probably so. Both Warhol and the Stones symbolized an attitude, a point of view, that reached beyond the spe cifics of their respective arts. Both realized that the crea tive stuff of the sixties came from the twisting guts and bloodied spirits of a society that had little interest in Ivo ry Tower Art. That, as much as anything, is why Warhol and the Stones seemed at times more important as sym bols than as artists. * Ah, but that was the six‐ ties. And now Warhol is talk ing — and who can determine the reality of his public, or even private, statements about changing his name to John Doe, about making a new start, unencumbered by the encrusted reputation of the “old” Andy Warhol. The Stones are making changes, too, moving their base of op erations to the South of France, and signing a mas sive new recording contract with the growing Kinney con glomerate (a shelter for At lantic, Warner Brothers and Elektra, to name only the ma jor labels). What all this maneuvering suggests is that Warhol and the Stones are remarkably perceptive to the winds of change that obviously are in the air. And for the Stones, their image tarnished by the events at Altamont (bitterly chronicled in the film “Gim me Shelter”), and less able to rely on their once unques tioned status as the meta phorical voice of radical youth, a time for reconsid eration and reevaluation is at hand. The special hazards (and occasional exhilarations) of looking for the “New Day” are noticeably apparent in the Stones' first LP on their new label, Sticky Fingers (Rolling Stones, distributed by Atco). Interestingly, the tunes chosen for the first sin gle release on the new label, “Bitch” and “Brown Sugar” (especially with the brassy horn “sweetening” on “Bitch”), are typical of the Stones music we know best — aggressive, noisy, irrever ent and supremely self‐confi dent that the shock values of, heavy sound, suggestive lyr ics and emotional electricity are enough to do the job. I dont't think the choise of these tracks for the first sin gle was made carelessly. They provide a kind of as surance — for the long‐time Stones‐freaks — that the band hasn't lost any of its machismo.” But dipping into the album other sensations begin to sur face. The most central is one of wonder that the Stones are willing to have a real go at diversifying their style. There is an almost obligatory bow to Delta blues in Jagger's whining, and probably uncon sciously humorous dialect on Fred McDowell's “You Gotta Move.” The Stones' earlier version of Robert Johnson's “Love In Vain” is recalled in the opening passages of “I Got The Blues,” but the sur prising addition of a horn section combines with unex pectedly spicy harmonies to make it a distinct improve ment over the original source of inspiration. “Wild Horses,” of course, is familiar to us, but “Caret You Hear Me Knocking” evolves into an extended piece, with a heavily blues based (but not terribly well played) tenor saxophone solo and then, suddenly, a shift into a Santana‐like guitar solo. “Moonlight Mile” has the heaviest production values soulful piano fills, a string section and a long, long Spectorish ending. The most fascinating pieces however, are “Sister Morphine” and “Dead Flow ers.” Both are rich with fertile new seeds for future Stones' development, without sacrificing past values. “Sister Morphine,” a particularly de pressing song, has superb in terplay between acoustic gui tar and Keith Richards' na sally toned sliding electric instrument. Jagger's under played, almost Dylanesque vocal gives the song some of the astoundingly moving qualities of Billie Holiday's “Gloomy Sunday.” “Dead Flowers,” no less serious in intent, uses the Grateful Dead ploy of disguising a drug culture/underground song in the folksy trappings of coun try music. Are the Stones ready for the seventies? Do they con tinue to be (here's that word again) “relevant”? I'd have to say the verdict is still up for grabs. “Sticky Fingers” sug gests that, at the very least, they realize that ides, im ages, and feelings appropri ate to the sixties are going to have to change if the group is not going to follow the unhappy path of their alter egos and closest competitors. The Beatles. And awareness, as a shrink once told me, is the first stop toward change.

489-> Arthur Spingarn of N.A.A.C.P. Is Dead
Arthur B. Spingarn, a Manhattan lawyer who was a leader in the struggle for equal rights for American Negroes from the foundation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1909 to his retirement as its president in 1966, died yesterday at the age of 93 in his home, 60 Gramercy Park. Mr. Spingarn became head of the organization's national legal committee and a vice president in 1911, and president succeeding his brother, Joel E. Spingarn, a poet and professor of comparative literature, in 1940. In that year the organization split off the legal functions into a separately‐financed Legal Defense and Educational Fund. The team of black lawyers who grew up in the N.A.A.C.P., led by Thurgood Marshall, now an Associate Justice of the United States Supremo Court, won the landmark unanimous Supreme Court decision in 1954 outlawing segregated public education. The immediate reaction of Mr. Spingarn and his associates was to announce new goals—eliminating residential and job discrimination throughout the nation. In recent years, for many black militants the goal of integration has become less attractive than the assertion of a separate black identity, and the N.A.A.C.P., with its partially white leadership, has been looked upon as as old‐fashioned as its name. Long forgotten was the almost scandalous militancy of the N.A.A.C.P.'s origins. Mr. Spingarn, a white man, was attracted to the cause by his experience in trying a civil rights case in the Manhattan courts, from which he concluded that a concerted effort would be needed to secure equal Justice. He had been admitted to the bar in 1900, after receiving a bachelor's degree from Columbia in 1897 and his law degree two years later. His parents, Elias Spingarn and the former Sarah Barnett, were respected members of the New York Jewish community; his father, born in Austria, was a well‐to‐do tobacco merchant. The N.A.A.C.P.'s initial impulse came from two white New York social workers, Mary White Ovington and Dr. Henry Moskowitz, who reacted to an article by a wealthy Southerner, William English Walling, denouncing a race riot he saw in Springfield, Ill., in 1908 and calling for a revival of the abolitionist spirit. The three met with Oswald Garrison Villard, publisher of The New York Evening Post, and decided to support the militant wing of what was then called the “colored” leadership (the word “Negro” was deemed offensive), represented by Dr. W. E. B. DuBois. Dr. DuBois contended that the Negro must win his fundamental human rights before self‐improvement, a policy advocated by Booker T. Washington, founder of the Tuskeegee Institute. The two Spingarns became involved. Those who knew Arthur in later years as a smiling grandfatherly figure in goldrimmed spectacles when they were out of fashion might have been surprised to see him in action six decades ago. One practice in New York in those days was to discourage Negro patronage at bars by charging them outrageous prices. Mr. Spingarn recalled that when he and black friends went to such bars, they would smash the glasses on the floor in an effort to discourage this practice. But the main fights were in the courts, and one of his first significant victories for the N.A.A.C.P. was when the Supreme Court in 1927 upheld its challenge to an explicitly all‐ white Democratic primary election in Texas. This was in line with the organization's major goals, which included abolition of forced segregation, equality in education and voting rights. The membership of the N.A.A.C.P. was 85,000 when Mr. Spingarn became president in 1940. In the 1950's it quadrupled, much of its growth being in the South. In the 1960's, with newer civil rights organizations capturing the imagination of black communities, there was criticism of the N.A.A.C.P. for having a white president and other whites on the board. In 1963 Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr., a Negro of Harlem, raised this objection and called its approach through the courts “nit‐picking.” Roy Wilkins, then and now the executive director of the N.A.A.C.P. called Mr. Powell's views “vicious” and praised Mr. Spingarn for more than half a century of service to “the organized fight against racial discrimination.” Mr. Spingarn announced his resignation at an annual N.A.A.C.P. dinner here on Jan. 2, 1966, explaining that at 88 he was “getting a little old,” but concealing the fact that with his customary vigor he had walked two miles from his home to the dinner. He was subsequently elected honorary president for life. In 1967, when a “young Turk” nominating committee dropped his name and several other “traditionalists” from their list of candidates for membership on the board of directors, the national membership overruled them by re‐electing five of the six, including Mr. Spingarn. A niece recalled yesterday, “He understood the change in feelings among the younger, more militant people.” But he stuck to his criticism of the Black Muslims, for example—not for their militancy, which “I believe in,” he said in 1963, not for their view of the problems, but for their solution. “I have no sympathy,” Mr. Spingarn said, with the Muslims’ advocacy of “a separate state of their own away from whites.” And he recalled that he had been picketing in the South as early as 1914 when a Negro group was kept off a civic program in Memphis. Mr. Spingarn and his “traditionalist” colleagues noted wryly during the mass marches and bus rides in the South in onstrators who regarded them as out‐of‐date landed in Southern jails, the N.A.A.C.P. was the organization ready to come to their aid. He was with the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. when he was stabbed by an apparently deranged woman in a Harlem store in 1958. In a statement yesterday, Roy Wilkins spoke of Mr. Spingarn's role as the N.A.A.C.P.'s unpaid counsel “challenging in the courts of the land the sanctioned institutions of Jim Crow.” His “epochal victories in the newly emerging civil rights legal field,” he said, “helped turn the tide slowly, but definitely, for his clients — the millions of black Americans who had no legal standing in the courts.” To the cause of freedom, Mr. Wilkins said, “he gave freely of his resources, his great legal talent, his wise counsel, his dedication.” A. Philip Randolph, the pioneer Negro labor leader, said: “I consider the death of Arthur Spingarn a great loss to Negroes in particular and the liberal social movement in general.” Mr. Spingarn sometimes mused that if he had not become a lawyer involved in civil rights, he might have led a serene existence as a bibliophile. A collector of rare books, he prided himself on having picked up prints of Henri Matisse in Paris in the days when they sold for $5 or $10. Characteristically, he combined his literary collector's enthusiasm with his interest in the Negro cause. In 1948, he presented to Howard University his Spingarn Collection of books, newspapers, manuscripts and other relics of the Negro story that he had accumulated over a 35‐year period. Until about five years ago, Mr. Spingarn visited Europe annually and would spend several weeks in London hobnobbing with fellow collectors. Most of his treasures were sold, at auction at Parke‐Bernet—his books, including first editions of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Mr. Spingarn's friend the poet Edward Arlington Robinson, in 1965, and in 1966 his graphic arts, in which the leading French impressionists and German expressionists were represented. His law practice had suffered in his early years, from his public involvement in the cause of equal rights, but later he felt it brought other clients to him for the same reason. He continued in practice here until two years ago. Mr. Spingarn was the author of “Laws Relating to Sex Morality in New York City,” first published in 1915 and in a revised edition in 1926, and was co‐author of “Legal and Protective Measures” (1950). He was an Army captain in the Sanitary Corps in World War I. In 1918, he, married Marion Mayer, a social worker who shared his interests. She died in 1958. The only immediate survivor is a brother, Sigmund, of New York City. A memorial service will be held at Frank E. Campbell's, Madison Avenue and 81st Street, on Sunday at 1 P.M. The eulogists will be Justice Marshall and Mr. Wilkins.

490-> Senate Rebuffs Pay Unit, Backs Retroactive Raises
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1—The Senate voted today to override the Nixon Administration's Pay Board, with the approval of the Administration itself, and grant retro‐ active payment of most wage increases withheld during the wage‐price freeze. The Senate acted in a bill extending through April 30, 1973, President Nixon's control over the economy. The retroactive pay provision had been a major issue of controversy between labor members of the Pay Board, including George Meany, and others on the board. While the Senate bill did not meet all of Mr. Meany's demands for retroactivity, it went considerably beyond the guidelines drawn by the Pay Board. The vote on passage was 86 to 4. Among the other major provisions of the bill were the following: ¶It provides legislative sanction for the President's wage and price program and machinery. ¶It authorizes lawsuits for treble damages to be brought by private persons against violators of the controls regulations. ¶It sets up a judicial review system to hear appeals against rulings of controls agencies. ¶It authorizes the hiring and payment of personnel to run Phase Two and the appropriation of the necessary funds. Meanwhile, the House Banking and Currency Committee reached an impasse today and failed to report out similar legislation. The chairman of the House committee, Wright Patman, Democrat of Texas, said that his committee would try again tomorrow to present an economic stabilization bill to the House. If the effort fails, Mr. Patman told reporters, it might take another month before Congress provides legislative authority for the President's program. The House committee deadlocked, 18 to 18, on reporting the bill when most Republican members and several Democrats balked at provisions of the bill opposed by the Administration. These provisions include mandatory controls on interest rates and finance charges, authority for consumers to sue violators of price controls for treble damages and provision for the payment of wages withheld during the 90‐day pay freeze except when “grossly disproportionate” with the rest of the economy. Except for the mandatory interest controls, roughly similar provisions are contained in the Senate version of the bill. Without enabling legislation, the Administration would have difficulty in funding its Phase Two program. In the absence of such legislation, the wage and price controls would be vulnerable to challenge through the courts. Both the bill passed by the Senate and the House committee bill give the Administration the authority it sought to run the controls program but both go beyond what the Administration asked. The Senate bill, which would amend the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, basically gives legislative sanction to the program of wage and price controls drawn up by the Administration and to the machinery set up to administer the controls—including the Pay Board, Price Commission and Cost of Living Council. The bill extends from April 30, 1972, to April 30, 1973, the President's authority to impose wage and price controls. Amendments to limit this authority to a lesser amount of time were rejected yesterday and today on the floor of the Senate. It also provides a judicial review system, including a “temporary emergency board of appeals” sought by the Administration. However, the Senate bill also provides authority for persons harmed by the wage controls program to sue for damages, including treble damages of up to $1,000 for overcharges. The Administration did not seek this authority. The Senate bill also requires the retroactive payment of all contracted wages withheld during the 90‐day freeze provided that such increases are not “unreasonably inconsistent” with the standards set by the Pay Board. The Pay Board has issued policy guidelines stating that such retroactive payments shall not be made except under spe cial circumstances, including cases where a company has raised prices in anticipation of paying the higher wages. The general standard set by the Pay Board would limit average wage increases to 5.5 per cent a year. The Pay Board's retroactive pay policy has touched off angry exchanges between the Administration and organized labor, which contends that all existing wage contracts must be honored. Last week, Secretary of the Treasury John B. Connally indicated that the Administration could accept the Senate's version of the retroactive pay policy. And yesterday, Senator John L. Sparkman, Democrat of Alabama, said that the Nixon Administration had sent word that it accepted the Senate provision designed to insure that most raises negotiated before the Aug. 15 freeze would be received retroactively. The Administration has ob jected to the provision of the House bill that requires the retroactive payment of all frozen wages except those found “grossly disproportionate” to wage rates in the economy generally. This wording has been viewed by opponents as broad authority for near blanket approval of retroactive pay. The Senate added several amendments today before passing the bill. One that was passed after heated debate was an amendment offered by Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, exempting all news media, including newspapers, radio, television, magazines and boks, from wage and price controls. The amendment was offered on the ground that to place the media under Government economic controls would open the way to violations of the First Amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing freedom of the press. It was approved by vote of 50 to 36. The four senators who voted against the bill were Barry Goldwater, Republican of Arizona, and William Proxmire of Wisconsin, J. W. Fulbright of Arkansas and Fred R. Harris of Oklahoma, all Democrats. The stabilization legislation must be passed by the House and go through a conference of the House and Senate before it can be signed by the President and become law.

493-> Hawks Could Be Difficult For Rangers on Home Ice
The New York Rangers, who do pretty well before their home fans, will collide with the Black Hawks tonight in Chicago Stadium, and there is no more difficult team to beat on its own ice. At least the Hawks have proved almost unbeatable there thus far, having won 11 of 12 games and allowed just 11 goals in the process. The only team that escaped unscathed was Montreal. The Canadians got away with a tie. What makes Chicago even more difficult to beat is the outstanding goaltending of Tony Esposito arid Gary Smith. They have the league's second best goals‐against mark, 1.76, and have posted five shutouts during the home campaign. Smith's goals‐against average is 1.76, Esposito's is 1.77. In front of the goalies are four of the league's most consistent defensemen, Bill White, Pat Stapleton, Doug Jarrett and Keith Magnuson. Still, the Hawks are having difficulties. They trail the first‐place Minnesota North Stars by 3 points in the League's West Division. The main problem is the lack of a playmaker between Bobby Hull and Chico Maki. Brian Campbell and Andre Lacroix have tried the center spot with little success. Campbell has scored two goals in 24 games, Lacroix three in 20. Hull has managed, despite the lack of center help, to score 14 goals and assist on 15 others for 29 points, and Stan Mikita makes his own plays, as usual. He has 27 points on 10 goals land 17 assists. The only other Hawk with at least 10 goals is Jim Pappin. But he has missed the last four, games with a dislocated shoulder and is not expected to play for another week. Meanwhile, the Rangers sail along on the production of the GAG Line, Vic Hadfield, Jean Ratelie and Rod Gilbert. So named because they score at the rate of a goal a game (almost), the trio leads the league with 118 goals and 127 points. A year ago after 25 games the line had scored 77 goals. The Rangers have put at least 30 shots on goal in the last 13 games acid in 21 of the 25 played. The opposition has matched that output four times against Ranger goalies. In fact the Rangers have been outsbot just once—in the second game of the season in Boston, which New York won, 4‐1. The Rangers conclude their midweek swing in Philadelphia tomorrow night. The Flyers have already lost once to the Rangers in the Spectrum, a part of their 6‐5‐3 won‐lost‐tied home record.

495-> Ira Kapenstein, Democratic Aide, Dead
WASHINGTON, March 1— Ira Kapenstein, deputy chair man of the Democratic Nation al Committee, a former Gov ernment official and newspaper man, died of cancer today in George Washington University Hospital. He was admitted last week with what was described initially as a virus infection. He was 35 years old. Mr. Kapenstein was born on Feb. 12, 1936, in the Bronx. He graduated from the University of Iowa School of Journalism in 1956. From 1956 to 1963, he was a reporter, political editor and Washington correspondent for The Milwaukee Journal. He joined the Post Office Depart ment in 1963 under Postmaster General John A. Gronouski. At the Post Office Depart ment he served on the senior management staff and on a spe cial task force that developed the proposal for transformation of the department into a cor poration. Those studies laid the groundwork for the creation of the present United States Postal Service, a Federal corporation. Mr. Kapenstein also served as assistant to Lawrence F. O'Bri en, who succeeded Mr. Gronou ski in 1965. He left the Post Office De partment in early 1968 to help organize the Presidential cam paign of the late Senator. Rob ert F. Kennedy. He was execu tive assistant to Mr. O'Brien, who had left the Post Office to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee and campaign manager for the Presidential campaign of Sena tor Hubert H. Humphrey against Richard M. Nixon. Mr. Kapenstein was named deputy chairman of the na tional committee last year when Mr. O'Brien returned as chairman.

To the Editor: I be suspicious. I really do be sus picious. In fact I am suspicious of the motives, the sincerity, or the integrity of those black English advocates who seem intent on placing new obstacles in the already difficult road to an edu cation our black children must follow. I be wanting to know who will be taught black English. Will all black children have to learn it? Or will it be required only of those who pass a black English proficiency test? What if a black child fails the test? Will he then be allowed to take only standard English? Suppose one child in a fam ily passes and another child fails? When should instruction in black English begin? Should parents help their children in black English at home? Who will teach the teachers? What if a teacher uses it on her own children? Will there be black English radio and TV programs? What about movies, plays, publications? Will any white children be allowed to learn black English? Do poor Southern white children speak black English or is it poor Southern white English? Should they be taught poor Southern white English or black English if they come East? How can we answer these perplex ing questions? The solution is simple. Teach standard English to every Amer ican child, be he white or black, Puerto Rican, German, Polish, Italian or Japa nese. To teach a black child black Eng lish is equivalent to leading him down the back road, at an early age, to illiteracy, frustration, failure and de spair. The black English boosters are us ing a great deal of energy, ingenuity and inventiveness in pushing their fad. Some show pique, impatience, displeasure, and even resentment when their plans are challenged. But they must be challenged. Standard English is the language of early childhood education, elementary education and higher education. It is the language of the three R's, geogra phy, history, the sciences, mathematics and economics. It is the language of literature, the arts, politics, diplomacy and the mass media. It is the language of business, travel, sports, entertainment and religion. It is the language to be taught and to be learned from the beginning. It is the language our black and white chil dren will use throughout their lives. No other English can be taught. Hastings‐on‐Hudson, N. Y. June 17, 1971

499-> Engineers' Unemployment Rate Found Almost Doubled in Year
The unemployment rate for engineers last June and July was reported at 3 per cent, almost double the rate of 1.6 per cent for the same individuals in the spring of 1970, according to survey commissioned by the National Science Foundation. The survey carried out by the Engineers Joint Council was based on the replies from 59,200 responding engineers. The survey indicated that on the basis of previous studies the 1971 unemployment rate for all engineers might have reached as high as 3.4 per cent. The national unemployment rate for all workers for the second quarter of 1971 averaged 5.8 per cent. The latest survey showed that engineers with master's degrees had a 3.2 per cent unemployment rate while those with bachelor's degrees reported a 2.8 per cent rate. Engineers with doctorates had a 1.9 per cent rate. The highest unemployment rate of 6.3 per cent was found among engineers previously involved in space activities followed by those in defense work, with 4.8 per cent. Engineers who had been employed in public works showed the lowest unemployment rate, 1.3 per cent. The survey reported that nearly two–fifths of the unemployed engineers had specialized in four fields: electronics, aerospace, manufacturing and systems engineering. Other fields with high unemployment rates were computer‐mathematics and product engineering. Analyzing the age groups among the unemployed engineers the survey found the lowest rate among those in their thirties, the highest among those under 24 followed by those 60 to 64 and then those 55 to 59. The states with the highest engineer unemployment rates were Washington and California, followed by Connecticut, Massachusetts, Florida, New Jersey and New York.

To the Editor: As former under secretary and vice chairwoman of the Overseas Commit ments and Development Committee of the Conference of Federated Trade Unions (C.F.T.U.), I must sharply dis agree with the interpretations given by Geoffrey Reade Duquesne in his Aug. 10 letter to the position of Labor rank and file both at the conference in 1967 and since concerning the question of British membership in the Common Market. To set the record straight, in 1967 Harold Wilson, then the Prime Min ister, sought to compel the C.F.T.U. to approve his proposal for British entry. In the Committee on Overseas Com mitments and Development, where the issue was referred, however, far from arousing the concensus of Labor, as Mr. Duquesne suggests, the policy of Mr. Wilson received the closest scrutiny and was in the end rejected. Quite simply, Mr. Wilson proposed, in a radical departure from the anti Common Market stance of the late Hugh Gaitskell, the Labor party leader preceding him, dangerously to en twine British institutions, interests and sovereignty with the bureaucracies of the European Community, permanently weaken the links between the United Kingdom and the developing nations of the Commonwealth and, destroy any possibility of a British detente with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Labor then and now rejects such vi sions of Britain's future place in the world, and the Labor parliamentary leaders, now out of power, have fully embraced the views of the rank and file. Next October, when attending the Labor party conference at Brighton, I shall with a large majority of Labor vote both to oppose the European policy of the present Tory Government and to disassociate Britain from any European design when the next gov ernment controlled by Labor takes power. We know as Mr. Gaitskell knew that the federation contrived by Mr. Heath and the Europeans can only unleash the most unspeakable havoc throughout the Western world. It is dangerous and expanding force that we shall continue, to oppose.

501-> 2 ATLANTA FALCONS ARRESTED IN A RAID
MARIETTA, Ga., Dec. 7 (AP) —Two members of the Atlanta Falcons, football team, Bob Berry, the quarterback, and Randy Marshall, a defensive end, were arrested last night in a raid on Mr. Marshall's apartment. Mr. Berry, 29 years old, was charged with assaulting a policeman and Mr. Marshall, 25, was charged with keeping a disorderly house, the Cobb County police reported. A party involving 8 to 12 persons was in progress when the raid occurred. The police also arrested Carol Nichols, 20, of Marietta, on marijuana charges. She was released on $300 bond. Mr. Berry and Mr. Marshall were freed on $500 bond. Deputy Sheriff Carl Price said that less than an ounce of marijuana had been recovered and that it had not been determined who had been smoking it. Mr. Berry said later, “I've never been involved with marijuana or any kind of dope. I've never smoked it, I'm a little shook up and very upset about the whole thing.” A hearing in court is scheduled for Dec. 23.

502-> Nassau Board Postpones Plans To Build 1,500 Beach Houses
MINEOLA, L.I., Aug, 14—The Nassau County Board of Super visors this week tabled a con troversial proposal by County Executive Ralph G. Caso to build 1,600 cabanas at Nassau Beach on the South Shore. The plan, which was present id at the board's regular meet ing the other day, called for construction of the cabanas in three stages over a period of three years at an estimated total of $9,000 a cabana. The cabanas now on the beach —1,216 renting for around $400 a year each—would be demol ished under the plan. Mr. Caso had proposed that his project be financed by floating 30‐year bonds, using rental fees of about $800 season to pay them off. At pres ent, cabana rents go into the General fund. Critics called the plan “a disgraceful waste of taxpayers’ money” and “a slap in the, face to poor people.” In tabling the proposal, the Republican — dominated board agreed to take over the plan ning of the future of the beach, which is part of the develop went of Nassau Beach Park, +county facility. In response to a question, Mr. Caso, who is a Republican, de nied that the board's move was a public repudiation of him by his own party. Instead, the Connty Executive took credit for', suggesting the change of approach at a closed meeting of Republican supervisors held prior to the full board meeting. “Because of the misunder standing and misinterpretation Of the plan,” Mr. Caso said, “I suggested that the Board of Supervisors table the plan and appoint a committee to work with me to develop an over‐all program for the use of Nassau Beach.” The Presiding Supervisor of Hempstead, Francis T. Purcell, one of the four Republicans on the board, said tabling of the proposal had resulted from the “bad publicity” it generated. “I did receive a great many phone calls from people who really felt that at this time we should not go ahead,” Mr. Pur cell said. “Mr. Caso wasn't sur prised at our decision. He's very sensitive to the people in our county.” Frank Krauss, press aide to Michael Tully, the Republican Supervisor of North Hemp stead, noted that the town su pervisors would be facing elec tions this November. “It's not the first time that, Republicans on the board did not stick together,” Mr. Krauss said. Greg Wynne, press aide to the County Executive, said that the public had misunderstood why the project was proposed and how it would be financed. “The point is the cabanas we now have are old, their con crete is crumbling, the plumb ing is bad, the pool is falling apart and the whole area has been rundown over a number of years,” said Mr. Wynne. “The question is do you renovate or build anew?” “The public thought that this would be paid for with tax payers’ money,” he continued. “But it was to be paid for with a capital bond issue and, from rental fees. That potnt did not come across.” The Board of Supervisors, made its determination on the basis of Mr. Caso's proposal for the first phasethe building of 516 cabanas at a cost of $5,227,000. The cost for the last, two stages was never presented to the board. Glen Cove's Mayor‐Supervis or, Andrew J. DiPaola, a Demo crat and chief critic of the proposal, will jodn Mr. Purcell in directing the board's recon sideration of the future of Nas sau Beach. There are two Demo crats and four Republicans on Nassau's Board of Supervisors. Several cabana renters ap peared at the meeting to pro test the demolition of the exist ing cabanas and the proposed raise in rents to $800 a year, or about twice, the present average. Another critic, Angelo F. Orazio, Democratic candidate for Supervisor in the Town of North Hempstead, called Mr. Caso “the chief cabana banana of the East Coast.” Mr. Caso's personal cabana at the beach, built last June, would have been demolished under his proposal.

505-> STORM KING PLAN ASSAILED BY CITY
New York City told the Federal Court of Appeals here yesterday that it had “mis takenly” believed the Cornwall, N.Y., pumped‐storage hydro electric project would reduce air poliution here. Now, a city brief said, it be lieves such a project “would be worse from an air pollution standpoint than constructing additional conventional plants in the city to meet that need.” This, the city argued, would be because the night‐time, off peak generating of electricity here to pump water to the pro posed storage project near Storm king Mountain would take place “when the general stillness of the high air and the frequency of early morning stagnation decrease the likeli hood of dispersion” of air pol lutants. It takes 1.4 kilowatts of pumping power to store 1 kilo watt for use at peak hours, be cause of frictional losses, the city brief said. The city asserted the Federal Power Commission had no basis for suggesting air pollution benefits here without requiring that pumping be done by out‐of‐town energy sources. The city brief, filed by As sistant Corporation Counsels Eugene Margolis and Evelyn J. Junge, opened a new round in the same court that in 1965 had set aside the first Federal Power Commission license for the con troversial 2 million‐kilowatt project. The commission had granted a new license last August de spite city protests of risk to its water supply system in the Catskill Aqueduct, 140 feet away from the powerhouse ex cavation—a protest renewed yesterday. The Consolidated Edison Company has said its invest ment in the project has amounted to $18.7‐million through last Dec. 31. The city's 47‐page brief yes terday declared the Power Commission had failed to comply with the National Envi ronmental Policy Act of 1969, requiring it to get comments of other public agencies on environmental impact. The city held the Hudson Highlands area was “a natural treasure,” and contended it would be unlawful to license any site there unless there was “a mandate that the site chosen be exactly restored” to its prior natural state. Since the commission's new license was granted last Au gust, the city brief noted Mayor Lindsay had given Con Edison a go‐ahead to build an 800,000‐ kilowatt expansion of its As toria, Queens, plant.

506-> For Young Readers
A restless, often disoriented guest at the American literary table, the Spanish ‐ speaking child has been poorly served by books that offer him, only those cues necessary for assim ilation. Although the vivid di mensions of Latin culture and the conflicts of immigrant life offer splendid opportunities for creative fiction, until recently, few books were available to authenticate—or even describe —the world of the barrio as its younger residents experience it. The impact of a minority group market on publisher's sensibili ties can best be judged by the recent appearance of a handful of fictionalized histories em phasizing Spanish ‐ American history, and several novels and picture books about Latin American families. Designed to proselytize, flawed by an ex cess of missionary fervor, the history tends to be mechanical. The fiction is more often duti ful than dramatic. Attempting to avoid literary sociology, Nardi Reeder Cam pion's CASA MEANS ROME (Holt, Rinehart & Winston, $4.95. Ages 9 to 12) has tried to go beyond superficial de scription — but has succeeded largely in creating a querulous portrait of Latin life that un wittingly extols assimilationist ideals. Lorenzo and his sister Blossom are “children of the house”— locked into their apartment and out of the streets when their parents are not available to supervise them. Like all children, they chafe at parental restrictions and fail to comprehend the reasons for them. Unfortunately, most readers will share the chil dren's bewilderment — princi pally because Mrs. Campion substitutes sociological for lit erary explanations for parental timidity, hysteria and rigidity. Moreover, by her own fail ure to understand the emo tional roots of traditional Puerto Rican behavior, she un wittingly supports the claims of an American school volunteer to superior understanding and compassion. “Casa Means Home” struck me as another book written by a well‐mean ing, talented outsider. Meant to be sympathetic, it appears pat ronizing. Meant to enhance the Puerto Rican image, it only diminishes it. A somewhat different effect is achieved by four Challenger books (Hill & Wang, cloth $2.77, paper, $1) written and designed to answer to the spe cial needs of black and Span ish‐speaking students, ages 10 to 14. Ed Foster's written‐to formula TEJANOS helps set the record straight about the role played by Mexican‐Americans at the Alamo; Camilla Camp bell's VIVA LA PATRIA mun danely recounts two events in the Mexican struggle for inde pendence. Leo Cardenas's un even but generally compelling RETURN TO RAMOS takes us from past to present into East Texas—where we make the ac quaintance of a spirited Chi cago family. The militant ac tivities of their teen ‐ aged daughter gradually draw them into participation in a school boycott, and we are afforded some intimate glimpses into the dignity and problems of mi grand workers. Least self‐conscious of the series is Pablo Figueroa's EN RIQUE. The tale begins in Puerto Rico, where Enrique Co lon is warned by an ancient curandero to beware an “In dian”— his double—in New York. The “Indian” duly ap pears, embroils Enrique with the police, and weaves in and out of his daily affairs—school, ice‐skating, job—to provide a symbolic representation of the evil against which he must struggle to manhood. Bill Ne gron's cartoon‐like illustrations neatly encapsulate the melo dramatic distortions of this novel. The vigor, humor and adaptability characteristic of Puerto Rican urban life are very much present. Avoiding both pathos and melodrama, Toby Talbot's MY HOUSE IS YOUR HOUSE (Cowles, $4.95. Ages 8 to 12) is a sensitive exploration of a child's attachment to the fa miliar, and her recognition that growing up means learning to surrender the past. Ten‐year old Juana is a determined girl whose agile imagination deftly peoples the ordinary world with menace even as her intel lect lures her gently back to reality. As we watch her pack the fragments of her childhood into boxes in preparation for her family's departure from the tenement flat that has always been her home, we come to understand her attachment to her past and her terror at the idea of moving away. We view the rotting neigh borhood through Juana's eyes —drawn, as she is, by the life on the streets, frightened as she is by the blank windows, and gradually emptying apart ments. A nightmare climax helps her make the transition, and gives her new insight into the strange behavior of her brother and her parents' in sistence that they move away. Mrs. Talbot's attention to small details, her palpable apprecia tion of the Spanish kitchen and her artful use of imagery are admirably matched by Robert Weaver's extraordinary illus trations. Wendy Kesselman's ANGE LITA (Hill & Wang, $4.95) is a lyrical celebration of Puerto Rico in which text and photo graphs make a nice point of the contrast between the gray, cramped city and the sunny tropical island. Using photo graphs of a real child, Norma Holt manages to suggest both the tenderness and tragedies of her situation. Angelita is given a rag doll just before she leaves for New York. How the doll comforts her in a strange new world, how she loses it in the snow and how the local bully helps her find it make up the simple plot of this appeal ing book. Even readers unfamiliar with Spanish will not be surprised to discover that MIRA! MIRA! (Lippincott, $3.50. Ages 6 to 9) means “Look! Look!” Dawn C. Thomas's text is little more than a Spanish‐American ver sion of Dick and Jane. The narrative begins in Puerto Rico; describes a family's migration to New York; catalogues the complement of beaming rela tives at the airport; and faith fully records the banal conver sational gambits that make a Point of immigrant surprise at the tall buildings. Culture shock arrives on cue with the dis covery of snow. Illustrated by Harold L. James with great good nature and less charm, “Mira! Mira!” fulfills pedagogical demands for simplicity, has a few bright moments and allows Spanish American children to share in the particular virtues—as well as the imagination ‐ restricting vices—of limited vocabulary readers.

507-> Television
MOST composers fight shy of the TV box. For them it is a monster that devours talent only to spew it out flattened into its own faceless image. But Benjamin Britten thrives on pitting his technical prowess against conditions that a lesser man might find constricting. He is also too sharply aware of the artist's duty to communicate to spurn the most powerful agent of communication our century offers. Reassured by successful BBC‐TV productions of his “Peter Grimes” and “Billy Budd,” Britten accepted a commission to write an specifically for TV. LONDON The result is “Owen Wingrave,” which this evening has its premiere simultaneously in nearly a dozen countries, and can be seen in New York on “NET Opera Theater,” 10 P.M. on Channel 13. For his first full ‐length opera in over a decade (projects centering on “King Lear” and “Anna Karenina” seem to have been abandoned), Britten has returned to the territory of what is perhaps the most dramatically concentrated and musically impressive of all his works for the stage. Like “The Turn of the Screw,” “Owen Wingrave” is based on a story by Henry James, made into a two‐act libretto by Myfawny Piper. The similarity does not end there. As in its predecessor of 17 years ago, the action in “Owen Wingrave” takes place at the end of the last century in a sinister old house in the depths of the English countryside, and once again ghosts play a crucial role in its outcome. Owen Wingrave is a young man who is being schooled for a military career. Like an unbroken line of ancestors before him, he is destined to be a soldier. But to the horror of his tutor, Mr. Coyle, this model student suddenly announces that he is unwilling to go through with it, that he finds war not merely brutal but immoral and the governments who wage it little better than a gang of criminals. In a word, he has become a conscientious objector in an age that has never heard of such a thing. Obviously Owen has to face his family at Paramore, their run‐down Elizabethan mansion in the country. There he confronts his grandfather. a senile general, whose mind roams among memories of the campaigns he fought in the India of his youth; his aunt, a formidable battle‐ax who can conceive of no other career for a Wingrave than that of a soldier, and Kate, the young girl he is planning to marry. Kate's role is crucial, for her future depends on her becoming mistress of a house in which she and her impoverished mother are living on sufferance. She goads Owen and calls him a coward. To prove he is not, he agrees to be locked for the night in a haunted room in which, 300 years ago, a Wingrave heat to death a son who had failed to rise to the standards of courage appropriate to a military family. In the morning Owen is found dead, another victim of the Wingraves implacable tradition. Clearly there is much in this tale to appeal to Britton's humanitarianism (he was a pacifist in World War In and his obsession with the theme of innocence outraged, which in one form or another figures in almost all his operas. Yet when James's short story, which abounds in hints and half‐lights, is spelled out in the form of a two‐act libretto, it loses much of its subtlety. James himself made a play of it, but Mrs. Piper's version at moments comes uncomfortably close to melodrama. This is partly due to the fact that its construction is not wholly consequential. Until quite close to the end of the opera, there is no intimation that it is the encounter with Kate that is to prove crucial. Till's there is little sense of one scene evolving out of another, until the drama reaches an inevitable climax. As a result, the action meanders. Britten's score is a highly skillful piece of work that accommodates itself to his chosen medium without prostrating itself before it. It is far removed from those trite TV operas that try to curry favor by pretending, convincingly enough. that they are not operas at all. He has worked his material with cunning flexibility, so as to take advantage of the camera's ability to move to and from scenes with a rapidity impossible in the opera house. But he has stood his ground on the essential matter that music needs time to make a point, and he has not abandoned the traditional layout of a number opera, even if the arias and ensembles are more concise than they might otherwise have been. “Owen Wingrave” is a work that is also able to exist outside the TV studio. It is scored, in the main with considerable restraint, for a medium—ize on?hestra. Thus in sound “Owen Wingrave” stands midway between the rich palette of, say, “Billy Budd” and the more austere world of Britten's church parables. Econ. omy is also evident in the use Britten makes of his material. To describe this as a serial score in the usual meaning of the word would be misleading, for his idiom remains unabashedly tonal. But, as in “The Turn of the Screw,” a 12‐note row does occur in the prelude and Britten makes wholly individual use of it. From it is derived a set of intervals that constantly recurs in various guises and gives the score a strong sense of musical unity. For instance, the melancholy yet noble (almost Elgarian, in fact) melody that accompanies a first glimpse of Paramore standing amid its neglected gardens relates to the deceptively simple ballad which opens the second act and tells the story of the Wingrave who in rage killed his son. And this in turn reappears in the intervals of a soft yet agitated string pizzicato that depicts Mrs. Coyle's wakefulness during the night that Owen is locked in the haunted room. The score is direct and easy to listen to. But it would be a mistake on that account to suppose that it lacks sub‐stance. Yet in the final resort it fails to grip the imagination. Coherence is a valuable musical adjunct, but of itself it provides no guarantee of dramatic power. Time and again I found myself seeking refuge in details from my failure to identify with the, drama. There are plenty that are worth listening to but the work as fire. Nor, it whole hangs fire Nor, it seems to me, are the characters drawn with Britten's customary skill. Mr, Coyle and his wife, the only people who have a notion of what is troubling Owen Wingrave, emerge as warm and sympathetic. But the Wingrave family is ridiculed and the militant aunt emerges as little more than a figure of parody. Britten's music reveals no more understanding of their predicament than they do of Owen's, and this failure robs the drama of a whole dimension. Because there is no proper encounter between two worlds, each of which is properly imagined, the element of tragedy is lacking. The opera is skillfully directed by Colin Graham and Brian Large. Britten himself conducts with characteristic rhythmic incisiveness and there is an outstanding performance by John ShirleyQuirk as Mr. Coyle. Peter Pears gives a telling character study of the general and Janet Baker is vocally flawless as Kate. Benjamin Luxon sings well in the title role, but lacks the ability to make intellectual conflict real.

514-> Shape and 8 Ex‐Governors Call for End of Executions
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 (AP)—The Supreme Court has been urged by Gov. Milton J. Shapp of Pennsylvania and eight former Governors to abolish the death penalty on the ground that it does not deter murder. In a friend‐of‐the‐court brief filed yesterday, Mr. Shapp and the former Governors said Lee Harvey Oswald killed President Kennedy even though the assassins of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley were executed. The brief was prepared by Michael V. DiSalle, a former Governor of Ohio. The other former Governors are Edmund G. Brown of California, David F. Cargo of New Mexico, Elbert N. Carvel of Delaware, Philip H. Hoff of Vermont, Theodore R. McKeldin of Maryland, Endicott Peabody of Massachusetts and Grant Sawyer of Nevada. The Court will hear arguments on the death penalty during the current term.

515-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: There comes a time in every na tion's history when that nation must begin to question why it exists, for whom does it exist, and what changes are necessary in order to insure its future existence. As to the first two, the answers are easily ascertained. But the latter proposition requires introspection. Within the past month there have been a great many people talking about the impending danger of Gov ernment‐ sponsored secret organiza tions and the threat that those organizations may have on the stability of America — F.B.I., C.I.A., J. Edgar Hoover, et al. Among those crying out in the wilderness are Michigan law profes sor Arthur R. Miller and Senator Sam Ervin. They have been crying out for a long time, but only now are they being heard. We are coming danger ously close to a “dossier dictatorship” as predicted by Professor Miller. This new revelation has hit such individuals as Senator Ed Muskie, Rep resentative Hale Boggs, et al. With the recent “coup” on the F.B.I. files in Pennsylvania, it became quite evi dent that the trusted bureaucracy of J. Edgar Hoover has now turned upon those who “march to the beat of a different drum” to preserve his future and protect this country. For example, Senator Muskie, Repre sentative Boggs and my former em ployer and friend Senator Hubert H. Humphrey—no doubt because of his liberal views on various issues—have fallen victims to the lurking evil of the “dossier dictatorship.” Such activi ties on the part of the F.B.I., C.I.A., et al., have a “chilling effect” on First Amendment rights. Yet, despite the incantations of many people, the director of the C.I.A., Rich ard Helms, tells the American public that such agencies as the C.I.A. are “necessary to the survival of a demo cratic society” and goes on to ask the nation to “take it on faith that we too are honorable men devoted to their service.” Mr. Helms' reasoning is tragic. It re calls Lord Acton's historic warning on power: “Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” America must be awakened from her deep slumber and realize the frightening nightmare she has been having is a potential reality—an im minent reality. We must realize that the Peters of the country do not shout wolf for want of a wolf: A wolf does exist in the form of J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I., Army Intelligence, the C.I.A., et al.

517-> THURMOND CLARKE, A RETIRED JUDGE, 68
LOS ANGELES, March 1 (AP) — Thurmond Clarke, who retired Sept. 1 as chief United States district judge for the Central California district, died yesterday at the age of 68. Judge Clarke, who had been on the bench for 38 years, was appointed to the Federal Court in 1955 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He became chief judge for the Central District in 1966. Beginning his career in 1932, Judge Clarke was well, known for his decision as a Superior Court judge overturning Cali fornia's law barring aliens who were ineligible to become citi zens from owning land. He said he believed the law was aimed solely at persons of Japanese ancestry and deprived them of due process and equal, protection of the laws as guar anteed by the 14th Amend ment.

519-> Danger Is Minimal in Arab Lands
Jordan has an especially dif ficult time attracting tourists these days since her most in teresting places to visit, except ing Petra and perhaps the an cient Roman ruins of Gerasa (now Jerash), north of Amman, have been under Israeli control since the 1967 war. In addition, of course, many travelers shy away from Jordan for political reasons or simply because they do not wish to get caught in the midst of any resurgence of the Jordanian civil war or in the crossfire of the Arab‐Israeli war. But if one wishes to visit Jordan for what remains there to see, I can say from experi ence that the danger is minimal. I visited the United Arab Re public, Lebanon and Jordan, in addition to Israel, in October and November and was able to get around with little difficulty. Indeed, service was probably better than usual in the Arab countries just because fewer tourists were there to be served. And, let me say, there was no doubting the people's warm welcome to Americans (espe cially in Egypt). A word or two of caution: Photography is forbidden in certain places, and some areas are totally off limits. Twice in Egypt I ran afoul of the law, once for photographing too near to a bridge and once for walking in a market late at night. But both incidents seemed to be due to the overzealous ness of secret service men, and the charges were dismissed in less than an hour: (Egyptians who crowded around me during the first incident seemed embar rassed and apologetic, whisper ing: “Don't be upset. Remember, these are trying times.”) Neither the Egyptians nor the Lebanese ask a traveler his reli gion these days, although the Jordanians still do (for security reasons). “All U. S. citizens, re gardless of color, race or re ligion, are welcome — unless they are known active Zion ists,” says an official of ALIA, Royal Jordanian Airlines. There are still barriers for the average tourist in crossing into Israel. Occasionally a jour nalist or an international of ficial can get special permission to cross the River Jordan to the West Bank and Jerusalem, but for all other foreigners there is no direct way to Israel from the Arab world. The shortest route usually is through Nicosia, Cyprus. If one is willing to suffer these inconveniences, the war probably won't hamper his movements further. Shooting started twice during my nine days in Amman. I simply stayed out of the way. (Some British newsmen recommend the deep end of the Inter‐Continental Hotel's emptied swimming pool as the safest place in town for dodging bullets.) The only frustration occurred at night. Restaurants shut tight at the first hint of trouble and we were foroed to eat in the un inspiring Inter‐Continental din room. Otherwise, services for foreign visitors had just about been restored to normal. —S.R.T.

520-> Guatemalan Students Begin Strike as Protest Against Violence and to Press Regime to Lift State of Siege
GUATEMALA, Oct. 9—Thousands of Guatemalan students are protesting the continuing high level of violence in the country and demanding the end of the state of siege, which has been in effect for 11 months. Similar demands nave been made by intellectuals, journalists and a group of clergymen. The 12,000 students in the University of San Carlos began an indefinite strike on Friday, promising to step up their active opposition to the armybacked Government of President Carlos Arena Osorio. Three smaller universities are debating whether to join the strike. Under the state of siege virtual martial law prevails in this country of more than five million people. Political activities are prohibited and the army has authority to arrest and search without warrant. The Government maintains that the state of siege cannot be lifted because of terrorism and violence. In a statement issued Friday night, it warned that it would not allow the university to be used as a shield to protect totalitarian political activities” and that it would forbid any public demonviewed as a thinly veiled threat to end the university's autonomy. The political violence that has shaken Guatemala for a decade has continued virtually unabated since President Arana, a 52‐year‐old army general who was elected on a law‐and‐order platform after winning fame by crushing rural guerrillas in 1967, was inaugurated in July, 1970. The state of siege was imposed last Nov. 14 after a renewal of urban guerrilla activities. Since then most of the violence appears to have come from an organization of rightwing terrorists (known as An Eye for An Eye), whose militants are believed to include members of the governing Movement for National Liberation, the police and the army. During the last year hundreds of people have been assassinated, apparently by the rightwingers. Many student leaders and left‐wing intelectuals have disappeared; some are found murdered but most are never heard of again. Several wellknown moderate opponents of the Government have been gunned down in broad daylight. After a slight lull during the summer, an assistant professor of economics, Juan Manuel Cordero Quezada, was machinegunned on Sept. 20. University professors went on strike to protest the murder and to press demands for the lifting of the state of siege, the release of political prisoners and the restoration of constitutional guarantees. Last week 10 Roman Catholic and Protestant clergimen joined the protests against indiscriminate violence. “The moral depravity reached by our society constitutes an absolute denial of the most basic human values and a scandalous disregard for the dignity of the human being,” they said. They called for the cessation of “revenge and the systematic extermination of Guatemalan citizens, no matter who is responsible.” The two foreigners among the signatories—a United States Episcopal Bishop, the Right Rev. William Frey, and a Spanish priest, the Rev. José Marf Marin León—were expelled on charges of interfering in national politics. They left Monday. Also on Monday, a former economics professor, Bernardo Lemus Mendoza, was briefly kidnapped and was handed letter addressed to the rector of San Carlos University. Dr. Rafael Cuevas del Cid, a liberal. The letter, signed by An Eye for an Eye, accused the rector of organizing the kidnapping of Roberto Alejos Aral, wealthy business man who ran for the presidency in 1966 and has been missing for two months. The letter, accusing the rector and five professors of being responsible “for the country's problems,” said: “Next time you will not be treated with courtesy but will be gunned down in the street.” President Arana promised to investigate the situation.

521-> Law and order—and death
On the night of Feb. 8, 1968, state highway patrolmen opened gunfire on student dem onstrators on the campus of South Carolina State College in Orangeburg, S.C. When the gunfire ceased, three students were dead and 27 others were wounded; the victims were all black. In “The Orangeburg Massacre,” Jack Nelson (until recently the Southern corres pondent of The Los Angeles Times) and Jack Bass (South Carolina correspondent of The Charlotte Observer) have gone back two and a half years and re‐examined this incident. The authors, with an appreci ation of nuance, do not gloss over the provocation that the students provided. Provocation, of course, is as necessary for the justification of killings such as those at Orangeburg, Jack son State and Kent State as it was in the earlier police beat ings and killings of old‐fash ioned civil‐rights demonstrators. The trouble at Orangeburg had begun over the refusal of a white bowling‐alley operator to allow Negroes to bowl. The stu dents at the town's two Negro colleges demonstrated. The demonstrations eventually be came violent. Many of the stu dents made themselves thor oughly objectionable, and some of the things they did deserved punishment. On the fatal night the prov ocations increased. Firebombs were thrown; policemen were struck by stones and other ob jects, and there is a strong suspicion that a sniper or snip ers fired on the officers at least a few times—although not dur ing the several minutes imme diately preceding the police response. The police finally opened up with heavy fire on a crowd that was advancing in what officers later described as a threatening manner. The authors finished their writing before Kent State and, as a consequence, fret over whether the same kind of force would have been used if the students had been white. Now that concern seems unnec essary. But the question of how much and what kind of force should be used in such circum stances continues to be asked. In some cases the debate has gotten down to such apparently fine points as buckshot, which is lethal (and which some of the South Carolina troopers used) versus bird shot, which almost never kills. More im portant, the authors point out, is an exploration of the motives and political considerations that precede the use of deadly force. At least some of the South Carolina officers apparently came to the campus that night with a determination to punish. The Justice Department later charged nine of them with vio lating the civil rights of the victims by administering sum mary punishment. A revealing line was picked up by two tele vision newsmen listening to a police radio after the shooting. An officer said: “You should have been here ol’ buddy; got a couple of em tonight.” The authors do not permit the blame to stop with the patrolmen, however; they allot some to the Federal jury that turned loose the nine patrolmen and a good bit to the political leaders in South Carolina. Gov. Robert McNair receives a spe cial share. He is the moderate who was elected with Negro backing, who enjoyed a de served reputation as one of the fairest Governors in the South on race affairs and who, ac cording to the authors, was seriously considered as Hubert H. Humphrey's running mate in 1968. Governor McNair's part in the Orangeburg affair was to send in the killing force and then permit it to be used. He did not give the command to fire, but the authors contend that he and others like him laid the groundwork for it with their “law and order” politics. According to the authors, he also refused to listen to black advisors and approved the use of unqualified force without considering any graduations. Tear gas, for example, was never taken out of the patrol men's cars that night, only buckshot was provided for their shotguns. The lessons seem never to be learned, and to some of us the story be comes progressively more de pressing. In Arkansas recently. two good and moderate men running for Governor both went out of their way to pledge that they would send live ammunition with the troops if students ever became violent in that state. As Mr. Nelson and Mr. Bass know, it is too often true that the only redress of a great wrong is good reporting of it. Their book is excellent report ing, and it apparently will stand as the only righting of what went wrong at Orangeburg.

522-> Letters:
To THE EDITOR: I did not realize just how long I had been a reader of the Travel section until my wife and I decided on short notice to go to Paris for one week. I remembered, seeing an article on a walking tour of Paris and, since we had been traveling only three years, assumed that the ar ticle was within these three years. I called the State Li brary in Harrisburg and asked if they had microfilm records of The New York Times and, if so, could they locate the walking tour. In one half‐hour the researcher called me back with the in formation that not only did she locate it in the files but that for 30 cents I could have a copy! Within another half hour the copy was in my possession and much to my surprise the date on it was April, 1961. I had been read ing the Travel section for a good many years before we were able to travel exten sively. It took us two days to cover the walking tour of Paris outlined in the article. We found it wonderfully in teresting. There had been only one change—the foot bridge between the two islands in the Seine was now replaced with an aluminum vehicle span. We visited Paris in December and found the weather excellent for walking. [The article referred to was written by the late George W. Oakes, a journalist and author who concentrated on writing about European travel, including walking tours of cities. Many of these walking itineraries appeared in the Travel section. Ac counts of 14 of his walking tours were published in 1963 by Holt, Rinehart & Winston as a book called “Turn Right at the Fountain.” A revised edition is scheduled for pub lication this year.—Ed.]

523-> For Young Readers
Although more than a year has passed since Apollo 11, 25,000 letters—mostly from the young—arrive at NASA each week, asking for “something about the astronauts” or “a pic ture of the men who walked on the moon.” This fact has not been over looked in the literary market place. Books of all shapes and sizes continue to pour off the presses. Inevitably, many‐too many of them are almost sin gle‐minded in concentrating on Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin and on the event itself. Persistent gaps continue in most titles. Few even bother to mention the Kennedy decision of May 1961 that gave birth to the lunar landing — or the massive build‐up of launoh complexes, spacecraft and ve hicles. Personalities Who played key roles—Wernher Von Braun, Christopher Kraft, Robert Gil ruth, Kurt Debus and others— are overlooked. This is not to say, however, that the current crop of Apollo literature has missed the mark. Tony Simon's (Four Winds Press, $4.95, ages 8 to 12) is a solid effort that makes no attempt to go beyond a recital of the events of July 20, 1969. It bene fits greatly from drawings by Lloyd Birmingham which give the reader simple explanations of orbital mechanics and mis sion profiles. Simon does not stop with the moon landing, but includes interesting mate rial on man's future in space, as well as a bonus slipped in the back cover: a 33 1–3 rpm re cording with the voices of Arm strong and Aldrin while on the lunar surface. (Harvey House, $3.25) is one of the Science Parade Series. Walter B. Hendrickson Jr., has told the story of the mission neatly and with dis patch. For the elementary school youngster, he offers a concise account of the voyage, complemented with illustrations by Vincent Colabella. Astronomer Franklyn M. Branley, has written  (Crow ell, $3.75, ages 9 to 12). It is a successful attempt to tell the reader about the landing in a detailed and yet readable man ner. While one would expect Dr. Branley to delve into the science of the moon, he con centrates on men and equip ment — the “feel” of space travel. His book puts the mis sion in the context of the first decade of space travel. Artist Louis Glanzman's clean style and a log of all U.S. and U.S.S.R. manned missions are helpful. (Franklin Watts, $7.95), edited by David C. Knight, contains biographical sketches of the astronauts and a glossary of space terms. But the real meat is the 200 official photographs. They carry the reader from Project Mercury through Apollo 13 (the most re cent, and almost ill‐starred, lunar attempt). It's hard to find anything the editor left out of this pictorial history for young teen ‐ agers: John Glenn running on the beach; the blackened spacecraft at Canav eral in which three astronauts died; color photographs of the earth from space; the lunar sur face; spacecraft in orbit; and close‐ups of the astronauts. is a vet eran space writer, and his first‐hand knowledge and back ground show in (Little, Brown, $5.95, ages 12 and up). This is a different book, for it turns out to be Shelton's own odyssey through the space pro gram. It may be a bit too per sonal but pit is never dull—a long conversation piece that of fers glimpses of astronauts that are fresh and vivid.

524-> 'Low‐Key’ Executive
MAN IN BUSINESS When George A. Nichols was elected president of De Soto, Inc., in mid‐December he assumed his duties in a relaxed manner. That's unusual since the company is in the detergent field, a prime target of en vironmentalists these days. DeSoto is related to the former division of the Chrys ler Corporation in name only. The company, with headquar ters in Des Plaines, Ill., has made its reputation as one of the largest paint manufac turers in the country and as a producer of wallpaper, in dustrial coatings and finishes, lighting fixtures and special ty building products. The equanimity Mr. Nich ols showed in moving from his position as vice president and general manager of the company's chemical group to the presidency was partly based on the fact that De Soto a few weeks earlier had come up with a nonphos phate detergent product sold through the Sears, Roebuck chain. The bullishness of the com pany about its detergents was reflected in these remarks by the 57‐year‐old executive: “Since the housewife doesn't go to Sears to buy detergents, we agreed to make another nonphosphate detergent that Armour‐Dial, Inc., will offer to supermarkets. Although DeSoto expects to gain from increased de tergent sales (they accounted for about 5 per cent of total sales of roughly $220‐million in 1970), it does not see them as its major growth area. “Our immediate future ob jective is to obtain the same reputation for our varied products that we have en joyed for our paints,” Mr. Nichols said in an interview. Since the product mix in cludes concrete additives, waterproofing compounds, masonry protective coatings, furniture, wood cabinets for television receivers and stereo consoles, electric heat ers and fireplace accessories, Mr. Nichols acknowledges that DeSoto's sales growth would benefit greatly from an upswing in housing starts. It was the slowdown in the economy that hit DeSoto as it did everybody else in the chemical and related fields and caused an anticipated 5 per cent drop in sales last year, from $220‐million in 1969. Mr. Nichols estimated that earnings for the year might drop by 30 to 35 per cent from the 1969 income of $8 million because of “digestion problems” the company had with three acquisitions. However, he believes that most of the problems have been resolved and that “De Soto is in a turnaround po sition.” Associates who have known him for many years credit Mr. Nichols with making the company research oriented, which in turn, they believe, enabled him to move into the president's office. A graduate of North Da kota State University with a bachelor of science degree in chemistry, Mr. Nichols joined the forerunner of DeSoto in 1948 as technical director of the company's research lab oratories. At that time, he recalled, the laboratory consisted large ly of a chemist, named Nich ols. Today DeSoto's research facilities employ 230 people. “I guess I must have shown some ability in management, planning and innovation,” Mr. Nichols said modestly when asked about his own success. Mr. Nichols's own involv ment with DeSoto coincided with the company's evolve ment as an independent en tity. Formerly United Wall paper, Inc., a Sears, Roebuck subsidiary, the company adopted the name DeSoto Chemical Coatings, Inc., in 1959. Two years later, Sears sold more than one million shares of DeSoto stock, sig nificantly broadened DeSo to's ownership. The current name was adopted in 1967. While Sears initially owned more than 90 per cent of DeSoto's outstanding stock, the most recent acquisitions by DeSoto dropped the Sears holding to about 32 per cent. Although Sears still is De Soto's largest customer, the development of industrial coatings, admixtures, sealants and other products has made DeSoto much more independ ent. For example, DeSoto de veloped an exterior coating product to protect buildings against weathering. DeSoto offers a 20‐year guarantee on the product and never has encountered a failure. The product was developed by the company's chemicals group, the part of the com pany where Mr. Nichols built his career. Mr. Nichols and his wife Jean live in a newly built, 4‐bedroom house in Oak brook, a western suburb of Chicago, about 20 minutes away from his office. The Nichols family includes two daughters, Linda, 22, who is a senior at the Uni versity of Missouri, and Nan cy, 31, a former photography model who is busy raising two boys. Mr. Nichols acknowledges that he is currently in the process of learning about fa cets of the business he had little to do with in the past, such as marketing. That effort, he said, re quired extra reading at home after his regular 10‐hour day at the office. Associates describe Mr. Nichols as a “low‐key execu tive” who appears almost to be on the shy side. “He takes the typical re search approach and doesn't make snap decisions,” one fellow executive said. Other favorable comments were “extremely fair.” “perfection ist” and “sound thinker.” Mr. Nichols acknowledged that he liked to run a tight ship, but preferred manag ing by delegating authority. When not involved in com pany business, he likes to re lax on fishing and hunting trips. He plays golf, but is “not bitten by the bug.” At home, the Nicholses en joy puttering around the gar den on their one‐and‐a‐half acre property. Mr. Nichols has a reputation as an expert on rose growing, and has ribbons and other awards to prove it. He prefers a quiet circle of friends to club activities.

525-> U.S. BUSINESS ROUNDUP
Corporate management has not been feeling too com fortable under the glaring spotlight of publicity lately. A few years ago it was a matter only of vociferous stockholders like the Gilbert brothers and Mrs. Wilma Soss. Now management must contend with young people denouncing its policies, Ralph Nader's stinging crit icisms, and more recently the Episcopal and other churches have gotten into the act. This book consists of chap ters on a wide variety of corporate problems written by a group of McKinsey & Co. executives. McKinsey is one of the largest of the management consulting firms. One timely chapter now that annual meetings will soon be in season concerns the role of company direc tors. The critical stockhold ers this year no doubt will scrutinize directors with keen interest. “Put the Directors to Work!” is the title of one chapter. This admonition conveys the message that di rectors often are window dressing or yes men. What many investors don't realize is that the board legally has “all the power in the cor poration.” E. Everett Smith, author of the chapter, takes a stand against the so‐called inside directors — officers of the company who also serve on the board. In another chapters—ded icated to executive develop ment — Robert K. Stolz shoots down a series of mis conceptions about regular de velopment of men for top positions. Other misconceptions are that management develop ment is haphazard, that the idea of a “crown prince” is dead, that courses are passé, that the aim of development planning is to broaden a man. A noticeable weakness of many management books is dullness and another is lack of specifics. This book es capes both of these draw backs more effectively than many books on management. However, the typical reader could still have a rueful wish for a little more color and use of particular examples Bank officers range widely from bond men to loan men to trust men to advertising types. The A.B.A. wants them all to know their investment ABC's, so it asked Dr. Freund, economist for the New York Stock Exchange, to do a book. Recently up dated, it offers a handy ref erence for any business man's desk drawer. One useful discussion in volves the right and wrong way to calculate yield on bonds selling at discounts. For example, the quick‐ minded investor might jump to the conclusion that a bond carrying a 6 per cent return and selling at 80 yields 7.5 per cent on the investment. In other words he divides the $60 annual bond interest by the $800 price for the bond, and that is the result. Yield to maturity is more complicated and certainly es sential for a bank man to understand, and there are two ways to figure it. The approximate method for a bond with 20 years to run would result in a 7.78 per cent yield to maturity. By a more exact method using published tables the result would be different. One weakness of the book is the small amount of space allocated to a discussion of commercial paper — promis sory notes of well known in dustrial corporations. Banks are more than a little inter ested in this growing field because so many of their cor porate customers either sell commercial paper or buy it.

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 9 (AP) —Two Philadelphia officials here urged that certain “victimless crimes” should be handled outside the criminal justice system. But District Attorney Arlen Specter and Police Commissioner Joseph S. O'Neill both warned against wholesale repeal or nonenforcement of laws against such crimes. Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Law Observance Committee of the Federal Bar Association, Commissioner O'Neill characterized “victimless crimes,” such as drug addiction and intoxication, as those in which no one but the perpetrator suffers.

528-> F.B.I. SAID TO BUG A HOUSE MEMBER
WASHINGTON, April 15—The Federal Bureau of Investigation sent an informer into Representative John Dowdy's office on Capitol Hill in 1970 with a hidden tape recorder strapped to his back, according to reliable sources. Besides recording the informer's conversation with the Texas Democrat at the Capitol, the bureau also monitored, and presumably recorded, telephone conversations between the two men, the sources said. Mr. Dowdy was indicted for accepting $25,000 in a bribery conspiracy. The sources stressed that these actions by the bureau did not lend support to the charges of Representative Hale Boggs, Democrat of Louisiana, the House majority leader, that the bureau was tapping the telephones of Congressmen. They took this position because the listening had been done at the informer's end of the telephone line, not Mr. Dowdy's, and noted that the calls had been made from the informer's end. They said that the bureau acted in the Dowdy case only after prodding by the local United States Attorney, Stephen H. Sachs, and after Attorney General John N. Mitchell gave his personal approval; that Federal District Judge Roszel C. Thomsen approved the moves in advance; and that the moves were specific actions taken in a single criminal investigation, not ongoing surveillance. But these steps by the bureau do contradict recent statements by officials of the Department of Justice that the bureau has never engaged in electronic surveillance of Congressmen, even in investigating specific illegal acts. On April 7, for example, Richard G. Kleindienst, the Deputy Attorney General, said in an interview on a Columbia Broadcasting System news program: “There have been a few specific instances where members of Congress have been accused of the commission of a specific illegal act. The F.B.I. would naturally conduct a limited investigation with respect to any such illegal conduct. “But the issue here is whether or not the F.B.I. had used electronic surveillance or the tapping of telephones of Senators and Congressmen even in a case like that, and the F.B.I. has not done so.” Yesterday, a reporter asked a Justice Department spokesman whether the bureau had ever engaged in electronic eavesdropping on any Congressman. The spokesman answered: “The F.B.I. has never installed an electronic listening device of any kind in the home, office or on the telephone of a United States Senator or Congressman.” Today, the reporter asked whether the bureau had over used an electronic listening device without installing it. The Justice Department refused to answer the question, saying it would “stand on” its earlier response. Asked if a hidden tape recorder would be considered an electronic listening device, department spokesman said, “I assume so.” Representative Dowdy was indicted March 30 by a Federal grand jury in Baltimore. He is accused of accepting a briefcase containing $25,000 in bills in return for seeking to block a Justice Department prosecution of home remodelers in the Washington area. The indictment also accuses Mr. Dowdy of committing perjury five times in an appearance before the grand jury on March 4. Mr. Dowdy has denied the charges and in turn has alleged that “powerful and influential enemies” are seeking to end his effectiveness “in ferreting out nonfeasance, malfeasance and misfeasance of government” in the District of Columbia. Mr. Dowdy is a member of the House Committee on the District of Columbia. 2 Guilty of Fraud The Representative made it clear in March that he thought the grand jury had been lied to by the two men he is accused of conspiring with. The two, Myrvin C. Clark and Nathan H. Cohen, were the sales manager and president, respectively, of the Monarch Construction Corporation of Silver Spring, Md. Clark was also indicted by the grand jury for conspiracy and bribery. Cohen was named a coconspirator but not a defendant in another case. Both men pleaded guilty in Federal District Court here to defrauding customers of Monarch. It was Cohen who reportedly served as the government in former. After volunteering to help Mr. Sachs build the case, against Representative Dowdy, Cohen was fitted with a small tape recorder by F.B.I. agents and was sent to capitol hill, the sources said. The recorded conversations, of which Mr. Dowdy was unaware, were turned over to the bureau, they said. Ruling by High Court In addition, the sources said, Cohen allowed the bureau to monitor his telephone, and presumably make tape recordings, on several occasions when he made telephone calls to Representative Dowdy. All the monitoring and whatever mechanical work was necessary was done at Cohen's end of the line, in his office or home, the sources said, so that no physical attachment or induction device was ever put on Mr. Dowdy's telephone. Bence, the Representative's phone was not “tapped,” they said. The Supreme Court ruled last week that the police and Federal agents do not need a warrant when they wire an informer for sound so that he records conversations with suspects. In the Dowdy case, Mr. Sachs sought and obtained a court order from Judge Thomsen authorizing the eavesdropping, presumably to make sure of his legal ground. One source here said that the eavesdropping hasi been necessary and justified. “If the Justice Department had not done that,” he argued, “it would have been guilty of observing a double standard—moving in one way against ordinary criminal suspects and moving in another, less effective way against suspected Congressmen.” Representative Dowdy was originally scheduled to go ‘on trial last Sept. 14, but his various illnesses have caused a series of postponements. He is now scheduled to be tried in Baltimore on May 3.

529-> Mark and Swiss Franc Stronger in Active Trading
LONDON, May 7 — Amid market expectations of floating rates on Monday, the West German mark and the Swiss franc strengthened further against the dollar today in ac tive foreign‐exchange trading. However, the markets, while still busy, were more orderly than yesterday as dealers wait ed for the weekend decisions from Brussels and Bonn. Euro dollar conditions were calmer, and the price of gold bullion— usually a barometer of currency unrest—fell sharply. The mark and the Swiss franc, along with the Dutch guilder and the Belgian franc, have been “floating” well above their fixed values since Wednesday. The central banks of the four countries refused then to maintain their fixed dollars parities at least until after the weekend. The central banks support fixed rates by buying their na tional currency for dollars when the rate goes too low and selling when the rate goes too high. When a currency is “floated,” it is left to find its own value according to mark lcet supply and demand. In these floating conditions, the mark, whose par value is 3.66 to the dollar (or 27.3 cents) was pushed up to 3.56 to the dollar (or 28.1 cents). The close yesterday was 3.58 (28 cents). The maximum rate permitted under International Monetary Fund rules is 3.63 (27.5 cents). Similarly, the Swiss franc rose to 4.145 to the dollar (24.1 cents) from yesterday's close of 4.175 (23.9 cents). The Swiss par value is 4.3725 (22.8 cents) and its ceiling rate is 4.295 (23.3 cents). The Dutch guilder was un changed at 3.55 to the dollar (compared with its ceiling of 3.5925) but the Belgian franc was stronger at 49.48 (com pared with yesterday's 49.85 and the ceiling of 49.625). The demand for all these currencies picked up during the afternoon as the banks in New York City entered the market. Earlier, the rates were down a bit. The effect of an increase in all these currencies is to de value the dollar. The pound sat on the side lines most of the day, although it was quoted in a nervously wide range of $2.4180 to $2.4193. It closed at its high, up from Thursday's $2.4188. The price of gold, which had been climbing at 19‐month peaks, fell from yesterday's $40.30 an ounce to $39.875 this morning and to $39.775 this afternoon. Dealers said that traders, who were described as mostly money managers of in ternational corporations, were taking their profits on the re cent rise. The demand for Eurodollars — the American dollar pool outside the United States, which has financed the cur rency crisis — also subsided. Quotations for weekend loans dropped back to 7 per cent from yesterday's feverish 30 per cent. Interest rates on three‐month loans dropped back to 7 1/4 per cent from 7 3/8 yesterday. As the hectic trading week ended, dealers turned their at ention to the weekend meetings and the possibility of officially sanctioned floating rates for a longer period. In October, 1969, West Ger many floated the mark for al most four weeks before for mally increasing its fixed value by 9.29 per cent. Today's rates revalue the mark at about 2 1/2 per cent and the Swiss franc at about 5 1/2 per cent. However, the permanent floating of a major currency is opposed by many as a dis ruption to foreign trade. Inter national monetary rules nomi nally forbid such action, and West Germany's Common Mar ket ally, France, is also opposed for fear that the European Eco nomic Community's unity will be eroded. The other members of the E.E.C. are Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxem bourg. Switzerland is not a member. Foreign‐exchange dealers questioned whether Germany can reach agreement with France and the other Common Market countries tomorrow on coordinated monetary measures. Many thought Germany would take unilateral action to con tinue the floating rate, at least for a while. “It looks as if a float is on,” a foreign‐exchange dealer at a large American bank said. “But its going to be a political bat tle with the French to try to get other Common Market countries to float with them.” The primary purpose of floating rate would be to in crease the price of the currency and so turn back the enormous sums of dollars that have cas caded into Germany and other countries in recent weeks. Central banks were obligated to buy the unwanted dollars (thereby complicating their domestic inflationary problems) to fulfill their commitment to maintain fixed values. How ever, at this end of the range, the European banks were, in effect, supporting the value of the dollar. Under present monetary ar rangements, all countries must intervene in the market to sup port their own currencies against the dollar. The nominal obligation of the United States is, to exchange the dollar for gold at $35 an ounce. The pace of trading in the New York foreign exchange market moderated further yes terday, as major banks here “battened down the hatches” for the weekend. Pending de velopments, banks here were, cautious about making substan tial commitments. While traders were generally uncertain about what actions would be taken, there seemed to be a rough consensus that a number of key currencies would be allowed to move somewhat more flexibly than in the past. Of the five currencies that were allowed to “float” against the dollar this week—the Ger man, Swiss, Dutch, Belgian and Austrian—the German mark and Swiss franc continued yester day to attract most of the trad ing interest, dealers said. Despite fairly wide fluctua tions in price during the day yesterday, both the mark and the Swiss franc closed the week little changed from Thursday, though, of course, notably high er than a week earlier. The mark was quoted by traders late in the day at about 28 cents, well down from its peak, yesterday of 28.20, and in fact slightly below the Thurs day close of 28.03. The Swiss franc reached as high as 24,30 cents during the day, but by late in the after noon it had slipped back slightly below 24 cents on fairly active profit taking. Bankers cited the easing of Eurodollar rates in London (the sensitive interest charge on loans of dollars on deposit in banks abroad) and a dropping back of the price of gold in London as evidence that the market were becoming some what less frenetic.

531-> Cahill Closes Forests In Northern Jersey
TRENTON, April 22 (UPI) —Gov. William T. Cahill closed all forests, woodlands and oven spaces in northern New Jersey today because of drought conditions and fire hazards. The Governor's order sup plements one issued on Mon day by Acting Gov. Raymond H. Bateman, which shut woodlands in the southern section of the state. Mr. Cahill's directive, effec tive immediately, closes to unauthorized personnel about one million acres of wood lands from the New York border down the Delaware River to Bordentown and up the New Jersey Turnpike to Woodbridge, and following the Garden State Parkway from Woodbridge to the New York State line. About 2,2 million acres of woodlands in the state are now closed to help prevent the possibility of accidental fires. In the last 10 days about 20,000 acres of forests have been destroyed by fire, the Governor noted. He urged everyone to exercise caution in disposing of lighted matches or cigarettes.

532-> JAMES SACHS, 63, LEGISLATOR, DIES
James H. Sachs, a West chester County legislator and an entrepreneur who had pub lished books, magazines and a newspaper, died here Wednes day of a cardiac arrest. He was 63 years old and lived in Pound Ridge, N. Y. Mr. Sachs was born in New York on Nov. 17, 1907, grad uated from Harvard in 1929 and took post‐graduate work at Trinity College, Cambridge, Eng land, and Harvard Business School. In 1933 he was a founder of Newsweek magazine, where he remained until 1937. From 1939 to 1941 he edited and published The Nashville Times. During World War II he held various positions with the overseas branch of the Office of War Information. From 1946 to 1948, Mr. Sachs was general manager of Young America Magazines and Young America Films, both in the educational field. In 1954 he became a founder and director of American Heri tage Publishing Corporation, Cleveland, publisher of Ameri can Heritage and Horizon mag azines and books on American history. He continued as a di rector until two years ago. Mr. Sachs was co‐owner of David White, Inc., New York book publisher, and a former director of Industrial Publish ing Corporation, publisher of trade journals. He also had been a director of several pub lic service corporations. Supervisor of the Town of Pound Ridge from 1959 to 1967, Mr. Sachs had served as member of the Westchester County Board of Legislators since 1969. R. Bradlee Boal, a fellow leg islator, described Mr. Sachs yesterday as “a modest man of integrity, with an incredible sense of humor.” For instance, when Mr. Sachs gave 7.4 acres of land to the Mianus River Gorge Con servation Committee, of which he had been vice chairman, he posted a sign on the prop erty, reading: “Please don't either feed or annoy the copper heads.” The gorge is in West chester and adjoining Connec ticut. In 1962 when Mr. Sachs, Republican, resigned temporar ily as Town Supervisor of Pound Ridge, he ‘wrote that he could not “accept the thesis that all wisdom resides in one political party,” but that the town should draw upon “the best available public‐spirited citizens of whatever denomina tion.” He added: “I know you feel profoundly opposed to this. So’ does White Plains “ In 1965 Mr. Sachs wrote Arthur Hays Sulzberger, late chairman of the New York Times Company, that this newspaper's masthead reading, “Published every day in the year,” was redundant and that it should read, “Published every day.” Within a week the change was made. Mr. Sachs had been a di rector of the United Fund of Northern Westchester, a trus tee of the Hiram Halle Me morial Library, Pound Ridge, a member of the 250 Associates of Harvard Business School, and an organizer of the Na tional Junior Achievement. His clubs included the Harvard and Players of New York. Surviving are his widow, the former Margery Fay; three sons, Samuel Sachs 2d, chief curator of the Minneapolis In stitute of Art, Arthur G. of New York and Stephen F. of Athens, Ohio; a daughter, Mrs. Cecily Feldman of Belmont, Mass.; his father, Arthur Sachs of Paris, a former senior part ner of Goldman Sachs & Co., investment bankers; a sister, Mrs. Nadine Zimet of Scars dale, N. Y., and a half‐sister, Mrs. Marian Frangois‐Poncet of Paris. A memorial walk through the Mianus River Gorge will be announced later.

533-> Movers Reach Tentative Pact; Industry Plans a Rate Increase
The moving industry here announced yesterday that it would have to increase rates for local and long‐distance mov ing as a result of higher labor costs under a tentative agree ment reached with two team sters unions. The agreement was reached early yesterday. If ratified by the membership of the two units at Sunday meetings, it would end the strike of 3,500 mem bers of Local 814 and 1,000 members of Local 445, which began April 1. Union leaders said members would return to work Monday morning if the pact was approved. Stanley Cirker, chairman of the employers' joint negotiating committee, and David Brodsky, attorney for the industry, esti mated that labor costs over a three‐year contract period would rise almost 50 per cent. They said the higher costs would necessitate an immediate increase of about 25 per cent in rates for moving and such services as packing. Mr. Brodsky explained that the movers, under regulations of the State Department of Transportation and the Inter state Commerce Commission, were required to file prospec tive rate increases with the two agencies 30 days before they are scheduled to take effect. The new rates, however, would be subject to approval by these agencies. The employers group repre sents 350 downstate companies. A spokesman for the team sters said that the tentative agreement called for a 75‐cent an‐hour increase, effective im mediately, and 40 cents more on both April 1, 1972, and April 1, 1973. The total of $1.55 an hour would amount to $62 a week. Previous wages were $142.40 a week for drivers and $134.40 a week for helpers. Besides the pay increases, the proposed pact would pro vide for a 25‐cent hourly pre mium for trailer‐truck drivers and 12½ cents for other truck drivers. There is also a pro vision for a 35‐cent hourly in crease in pension, welfare and annuity contributions. Both locals will hold rati fication meetings on Sunday at 10 A.M. Members of Local 814 will meet at Manhattan Center here and members of Local 445 will meet at Lincoln Hall in Yonkers. The agreement was reached early yesterday morning after extended negotiations at the Travelers Hotel‐Motel at La Guardia Airport.

535-> Studies Find Decline in Freshmen at 4‐Year Colleges
A decrease in the number of first‐time freshmen entering the country's four‐year collegen and universities is pointed up by two studies being issued today. The Carnegie Commission on Higher Education says that the decrease is 0.3 per cent and en annual survey conducted from the University of Cincinnati shown a decline of 0.7 per cent. Each study included some schools that the other did not. This year was only the third since World War II—the others were 1951 and 1966—in which freshmen enrollment in four‐year colleges and universities fell, according to Dr. Garland Parker, Cincinnati's vice provost and former registrar. “There may have been as many as 110,000 unfilled places in the freshman classes,” the Carnegie Commission said on the basis of projections. In spite of the slowdown in new freshman enrollments at the four‐year institutions, however, the total number of freshmen increased because of larger classes than last year at public junior colleges, which the Carnegie survey showed to have a 6.4 per cent increase. Thus, there was a total over‐all increase of 1.9 per cent in first‐time freshmen at all of the nation's colleges and universities, two‐year and four‐year. The results of the surveys again underline the growing importance of junior colleges in the structure of higher education. Moreover, college registrars commented in the Carnegie survey that “the general economic situation and decreased job opportunities” were factors in the enrollment decline. An increasing number of questions are being raised about the value of a college education, especially if it is no longer a guarantee of a job. Among the findings of the Carnegie Commission's survey were the following: ¶In general, private colleges and universities experienced less enrollment growth than public institutions. For instance, while the total enrollment in public universities grew by 3.5 per cent, it dropped by 1.5 per cent in private universities. ¶Graduate enrollments showed greater percentage increases than undergraduate. The 5 per cent enrollment growth in the graduate programs of the nation's fouryear colleges and universities was more than twice as large as the 2.4 per cent increase in their undergraduate enrollment. ¶There was more of a tendency this year for students to take a break between high school and college or to take a leave of absence from their college studies or to transfer to another institution. There were 10 per cent more first‐time transfer students than in 1970. ¶The greatest enrollment gains in terms of percentage were made by blacks and Spanish‐surnamed students. Also, the percentage of women in higher education grew faster than the percentage of men. Spanish‐surnamed persons showed increases of 21.7 per cent in first‐time freshman enrollment and 46.4 per cent in flrst‐time graduate enrollment. For blacks, the corresponding increases were 13.7 per cent and 12 per cent. A Carnegie Commission spokesman said a reason for the large gains by minority groups was that the number enrolled was so small that a relatively limited numerical increase shown up as a large percentage increase. Major fields of study that the Carnegie Commission survey found to be of greatest popularity were social work, urban studies, forestry, law, nursing and the allied health fields. A total of 8.4‐million students are now enrolled in America's colleges and universities, it is estimated by the National Center for Educational Statistics of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The center is also making a survey on enrollment.

536-> U.S. Project Finds Work for Jobless
DETROIT, Dec. 14—In Detroit all the galleries of the city's art museum will be open each day for the first time in years. In the rural school districts of Hope and Finley, N. D., there's a guidance counselor where them was none before. And in Gloucester, Mass., the brother‐in‐law of the City Manager's secretary, with a Navy pension, is the new building inspector. In sum, the new Federal Public Employment Program (PEP in governmentise), the first such project since the Depression days, is operating and adding to the number of people who have jobs. But, perhaps as important, the program appears as much a rehearsal for the long‐discussed revenue sharing as it is an unemployment project, something new in the way the Federal Government gives out money and something local public officials like. The program has the advantages and disadvantages of revenue sharing. Localities decide where the money should go, and Washingtondirected priorities are not too important. Some communities are using the money to restore or provide services that could not be afforded, and some are just using it. As many persons inside and out of government have pointed out, the program obviously is not any curean for the nation's 6 per cent unemployment rate. Even if the 148,000 jobs planned in the two‐year, $2‐billion Emergency Employment Act are filled (and 63 ON were filled by Dec. 1, the Labor Department reported), they would be a fraction of the 4.8 million listed as unemployed at the end of last month. “The health of the economy is what creates jobs, not the idea of putting everybody on the public payroll,” said Malcolm Lovell, Assistant Secretary for Manpower in the Labor Department, in answer to that complaint. There are others: That the Public Employment Program is not particularly aimed at helping what's called the hard core or the blacks—and it's not so planned., although the “disadvantaged” and veterans are to get job preferences. That it does not give enough attention to city cores where unemployment is heaviest but spreads the jobs thinly across the entire nation—which it does with 80,000 units of government, school boards, cities, counties, states and the like, eligible for federally paid jobs. That it is too susceptible to political patronage and that communities instead of using the Federal money to create new jobs may simply shift present job holders to the public payroll—an issue that is not likely to raise a moral question in any city trying to scrape up enough money to meet its payrolls without layoffs. The number actually put on the program's payrolls climbed so slowly after the bill was signed July 12 that last month, President Nixon urged local public officials to move “with speed and vigor” to fill the jobs. The Government promised work for 100,000 under the program by Christmas but may fail to meet the goal because in some communitiies the hiring process is agonizingly slow. In Detroit, for example, with 90,000 to 100,000 eligible for the 800 federally paid jobs with the city, only 170 have been put to work while hundreds apply for an open position. Civil Service rules are tho trouble, said Haskell Stone, Detroit's manpower administrator. “Once they apply, they are reviewed, tested, graded, interviewed and ranked on a list,” all taking time. When jobs are filled the effect may be dramatic. In Detorit, the city government, to save money, stopped hiring museum guards early in the year, and a third to half the .galleries have been closed daily because of the guard shortage. The museum asked for 20 working as city guards, but with federally paid salaries starting at $7,683 a year, and is getting them. By Christmas the entire museum is expected to be kept open daily. “I can't overemphasize what this means,” said Willi Liam Bostick, the museum administrator. “People come to see the museum and the galleries are dark. If it hadn't been for the Federal Government program we'd still be in the darks.” “One thing significant is the type of person we're getting,” he said. There's no doubt that the new guard is not the usual museum guard. Don Stawiasz, 25 years old, for example, was a draftsman for four and a half years at the General Motors Corporation and was laid off in January because the carmakers were de‐emphasizing new model changes. He found no work after April and had $80‐a‐week unemployment compensation for his wife and two children. His new job doesn't have the money or the prestige of the old one but he said: “Seven and a half years in drafting and all I have is a collection of pink slips.” The new men may not stick. “I don't see how he can last; he'll be bored to tears inside a month,” said a museum official, nodding at Mr. Stawiasz. But the museum really does not care if the guards stay for years as long as they are there now, and, indeed, Federal officials hope the new employes will drift into private employment. Another new guard, William Fields, a 24‐year‐old Negro, was selling pianos until October and $503 was the smallest check [every other Week] I ever brought home,” he said. But he didn't like selling and quit. The guard job was the best he could find. “Some income is better than none,” he said, and he is working liter a university where he can resume his studies. The difference between this and other Government aid is that “you can decide what your needs are,” said Mr. Bostick. Other Federal money was always for specifie programs that drained away some of the museum's energy into new areas when it was not doing enough in the first place. “It's a first step in a Federal revenue sharing,” ho said. “Museums around the country are so hurting that they need new programs like they need two or three wings.” “This is the first time the Federal Government has given local governments this much responsibility in the use of funds,” echoed Erling Mork, assistant city manager of Tacoma, Wash. “It's a good run‐through for revenue sharing.” The Labor Department re ports that to date 23 per cent of the jobs are in public work and transportation (bus drivers), 18 per cent in education, 12 per cent in law enforcemeat (the police and en occasional assistant prosecutor), 10 per, cent in local health services, 7 per cent in parks and recreation and another 7 per cent in social services, 5 per cent in jobs connected to the environment, 3 per cent for firemen and 15 per cent in other public jobs. And the variety of jobs is wide. In Aberdeen, South Daketa's third largest city with 27,000 population, two police men, three firemen and a library assistant an unemployed teacher—were hired, as well as four teacher aides. In Detroit the first hired were 19 tree trimmers laid off in an efficiency move last spring, but the extra men will allow more stump removal. In Gloucester, Mass., population 26,000, the first of 24 Jobs filled was a building inspector and that job went to the brother‐in‐law of Theresa Wenson, who is city Manager Paul F. Talbot's secretary. A full‐time solicitor was also hired under the program, but Gloucester had a part‐time solic tor. He now becomes fulltime and gets his salary increase from the Federal Government while continuing to collect his base rate from the city. There's a federally paid director of the city's drug program, but the old drug program Also had a director, paid by the city, who retired a few weeks before his new job was created through the Federal Emergency Employment Act. The Government has tried to keep localities from merely switching payrolls to the Federal Treasury by saying that a public employe must he laid off 30 days before he can be rehired at Federal expense. In Boston, 569 jobs are expected to be supported under the Public Employment Program, and 103 teacher aides, among the already‐hired, will help make up for 170 laid off in the spring. In Wake County, N. C. (Raleigh), there are 17 jobs under the Federal program and 8,000 unemployed. The jobs filled include director of the local juvenile home—at $3.64 an hour—a job filled by Fred Hinson, a Vietnam veteran. The 17 Wake County jobs Include six Janitors. The state of New York has about 1,000 jobs to fill—New York cities have other allotments—with 503 to go to the Mental Hygiene Department, the biggest employer among state agencies and hit hard by budget cuts last spring. In Fargo, N. D., an environmental planner, Rudolph Wagner, 42, an aerospace engineer out of work 13 months, was hired at $12,000 a year under the Federal program. “There are thousands of engineers looking for an opportunity like this,” he said. And in the Hope and Finley School Districts of North Dakota, Erin Caldwell, 29, looking for work, became the first guidance counselor for 545 schoolchildren. “The kids in the rural areas are crying for the [career] guidance,” the now counselor said. A third of the Jobs are to go to veterans, but in Sacramento, Calif., there have been protests that the county did not distinguish between younger veterans from Vietnam and the retired and pensioned veterans, and the retired career men are the leadlag job candidates In half the eligibility lists.

538-> 75 Inmates From Homicide Wing Battle Guards on Rikers Island
Seventy‐five inmates clashed with guards yesterday morning at the Adolescent Remand Shel ter on Rikers Island after a fist fight between a guard and a young prisoner. A spokesman for the Depart ment of Correction termed the incident a “disturbance” and said “sporadic altercations” had continued for some 30 minutes before order was restored. According to the department, 17 correction officers and 16 inmates were injured, but none seriously enough to be hospi talized. One correction officer was sent home. The harbor police reported that the fights broke out at 8:45 A.M. when one of 86 in mates was taken out of a line of prisoners who were being escorted to the gymnasium by a few guards. A. L. Castro, a spokesman for the Department of Correc tion, said the youth had been singled out because he was act ing in a “boisterous” manner. A fight broke out between the guard and the inmate, he said, and when the officer at tempted to remove the prisoner to the front of the institution, about 75 of the other prisoners followed them. A “series of sporadic alter cations” ensued, according to Mr. Castro, and guards from other buildings on the island were called to put down the disturbance. District Attorney Burton B. Roberts of the Bronx said af terward that all 86 of the inmates were from the homi cide wing of the shelter and were awaiting trial or sentence on murder charges. “At this stage of the investi gation,” he said yesterday eve ning, “I can safely state that the matter will be referred to a grand jury.” Among the injured officers was Deputy Warden Adam Mc Quillan. “He was one of the men who got bashed around in the fighting,” Mr. Castro said. He said no weapons had been used to restore order, although additional guards were called in. The shelter contains 1,400 in mates, he said, and is attached by a corrider to a reforma tory on the island. The disturbance was the first known serious incident on Ri kers Island since a one‐day up rising took place last October, when riots broke out in city prisons elsewhere.

Arthur G. McKee & Co., specializing in the engineering, design and construction of metal refining, coal preparation pits and food precessing plants, announced yesterday that it is planning to make a provision of $3‐million in its financial results for the first six months ended June 30, 1971, to cover “probable losses on certain large lump‐sum contracts.” While the final figures for the first six months are not yet available, the company said there would be a “substantial loss” for the second quarter and the first half as a result of the $3‐million privision. It was also announced at the company's board of directors’ meeting in Cleveland that the third‐quarter dividend would be omitted. Two quarterly dividents of 20 cents a share have already been paid this year.

541-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: I am surprised that there has been so little discussion or support for the bill introduced by Representative Koch of New York to authorize the issuance of 30,000 special immigrant visas for Soviet Jews. It has been cosponsored by 117 Representatives and Senator Case has introduced a similar bill in the Senate, which has been cosponsored by Senator Javits and 34 other Senators. These bills reflect the concern of Americans of both parties and every faith and they are necessary because the present immigration law is primarily limited to immediate family members, the 10,200 visa numbers for all refugees from Communist lands is only available for those who have succeeded in crossing the Iron Curtain —an almost impossible feat for Soviet citizen—and, in view of Arab pressures, there is some ground to believe that the Soviet Union might be more willing to permit Soviet Jew's to immigrate to the United States than to Israel. The Soviet Union and the world should know that we, too, will welcome Soviet Jews and remain a haven for victims of religious persecution as in the days of our forefathers. Neither the fact that there is now an Israel nor that most Soviet Jews want to go there should deter Americans from making every effort to open their doors as well. Extremists have gained attention and support by the violence of their attacks on the Soviet Union's restrictive emigration policy. This bill provides all of us with an ideal opportunity to demonstrate our genuine concern with Soviet Jews. HENRY S. MOYER Chairman, the American Council for Judaism Philanthropic Fund New York, Aug. 9, 1971

545-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: Having had some experience as prosecutor of war crimes, may I undertake to point out whet seems to me to be some significant parallels between the public reaction to the Calley verdict and that of the German people to Nuremberg. Initially the German people condemned the trials as the victors sitting in judgment on the vanquished as the world looked upon them as collectively guilty. In time they accepted the basic principle of Nuremberg that guilt is personal to the participating individual and undertook to absolve themselves from the collective guilt feeling by embarking on an extensive war crimes prosecution program of their own. The acceptance of the new Germany by the international community is necessarily based on its having absolved the people of collective guilt. What the current reaction to the Calley verdict seems to me to be is that we are collectively associating ourselves with Mylai and seem to feel collectively guilty and reacting accordingly. In time, I believe, we will come around, as the German and international community did, to reject the feeling of collective guilt and realize that so substantial a departure from the standards of the international rules of warfare by a soldier are personal to him as an individual and cannot be condoned. MORRIS AMCHAN Former Deputy Chief Counsel for War Crimes, Nuremberg Arlington, Va., April 3, 1971

546-> French Town's Liberators Convene in Orange, Mass.
ORANGE, Mass., June 7— Orange, they say, is much like a small town in France called Sainte‐Mère‐Eglise. In both there is a bridge spanning a muddy river. And in Orange there is an inter section very much like the one in France where the roads meet that connect that section of the Normandy coast with the heartland. Twenty‐seven years ago— June 5 and 6, 1944—the al lied invasion of France began at Sainte‐Mère‐Eglise when elements of the 82d Airborne Division parachuted in to de stroy the bridge and occupy the intersection. It was the first town in France to be liberated. And this past weekend, 130 former members of the 82d Airborne gathered here to commemorate the event. They chose Orange because it looks like Sainte‐Mère Eglise and because it has a sport parachuting center. The veterans looked for, and sometimes thought they saw, places like the church steeple that John Steele's parachute caught on (“You remember him, Red Buttons played him in the movie ‘The Longest Day’”); or the back yard where Robert Murphy landed just as the woman was going to the outdoor bathroom “and it scared them both almost to death.” Generally they enjoyed both the celebration staged by nearly all of the 6,000 residents of Orange and their own beer busts and barbe cues. The people of Orange par ticipated totally in the cele bration for parachuting has become a big industry here since Parachutes, Inc., opened in the early 50's, and brought a prosperity to the town unknown since Minute Tapioca moved out. There was a time, around the turn of the century, when Orange almost became a little Detroit. The Grout Automo bile factory, built here in the early 1900's, was the first in America—but it failed. The White Sewing Machine Com pany moved away before it started manufacturing cars and trucks. It is a quiet little town through the week, but on weekends enthusiasts from New Hampshire, Connecticut, Vermont and Boston pour in to float through the skies above Orange on silken clouds. A parade this weekend had the widow of the wartime Mayor of the French town as guest of honor. Parades are the stuff the 82d is made of. One of the most decorated airborne units of the Second War, the 82d held the record for combat jumps, It spearheaded the campaigns into North Africa, Sicily, Italy, Normandy and Holland. The division is also prob ably the tightest knit veter ans group, and it holds an nual conventions in addition to trips back to the towns and beaches in Europe. Many of these middle‐aged men never gave up jumping and have organized The Old Tim ers Club of the 82d. Ray Bridgen, or Arnold, Pa., was becoming increasing ly nervous as he watched the billowing wind sock at the sport parachuting center. Three hours earlier he and 24 others had tentatively agreed to make their first parachute jump since they leaped in combat in Europe. Winds up to 55 knots had held up the event and prom ised to put it off for another hour or so. It gave Ray Bridgen time to think about the fact that he is now 48 years old. Oth ers had a chance to think too, and one by one they drifted across the highway to “test the beer to make sure it'll be ready for the barbe cue tonight.” “I'm not sure some of these guys are going to be in shape to jump when the time comes,” an instructor at the jump center told the head of the 82d reunion group. “Don't worry,” he was told, “those guys who are drink ing don't want to jump now.” “Say,” called another, “when can we jump?” “As soon as the wind dies down.” “Hell, we'll die before that, just standing here thinking.” By 6 o'clock the wind had died, and so had the enthu siasm. Only six remained to jump. The others had gone, as one of them said, “be cause the last time—27 years ago—I didn't have a choice like I do today.” Ray Bridgen jumped. He sailed down from 2,000 feet under a silk canopy of orange and white, and had “a few minutes when I was light as air and 21 again.” In the cool smoke haze of Tony's Dutch Room across town, darker thoughts took hold and members of the 82d talked of those dead. They told the stories with a casualness born of repeti tion and still, after all these years, a touch of disbelief that they were here and it was someone else who had been killed. “I was right behind him when he was hit by a Jerry sniper—they got six of us that day . . .” “Carl was right next to me when the 80‐8 shell hit the wall. . . “ “Of 600 men in the town there were 300 wounded or dead by the time they re lieved us three days later...” It was hard to hold such talk outdoors for the warm wind cleared their minds just as it wiped the sky a clear pale blue. Stories outside were bright, vibrant, like the wind‐starched French and American flags that colored every‐thing red, white and blue. Out here the men from the 82d toasted Col. Robert M. Piper and his wife, Steve. “Yeah, Steve—we called her Steve of the Red Cross. She and the colonel—he was a captain then—met in Nor mandy and they were mar ried there in France.” Steve, with her bright smile and tarnished copper hair, and Colonel Piper de ceptively young looking, were the center of attention outdoors. And the colonel, still on active duty, swung his eyes across the scenes and said quietly: “This is what this country needs—more parades like this.”

548-> New Democratic Coalition Is ‘Distressed’ by Some of Lindsay's Endorsements
The New Domocratic Coali tion, which helped re‐elect‐ Mayor Lindsay in 1969, criti cized him yesterday for giving his endorsement around the country to local Democratic candidates who have “not been progressive and liberal.” In a letter to Mr. Lindsay, state officers of the coalition expressed “deep disappoint ment” in what they charged was the Mayor's failure since he became a Democrat two months ago to work for a coalition of Democrats from “the liberal, progressive and reform elements in our party.” The letter was written by the coalition's state chairman, Dan Collins, and was approved at a meeting of officers last Tuesday evening. “We are quite distressed with your endorsements and accolades for persons like Mayor Joseph Alioto of San Francisco, Mayor Frank Sedita of Buffalo and various politi cians in Indiana, including Con troller Bob Pastrick of East Chicago, Ind.,” the letter said. “The record of such individ uals has not been progressive and liberal,” the letter con tinued, “and in each case there appeared to be reform opposi tion to their candidacies which you could have chosen to sup port.” In rebuttal, Deputy Mayor Richard R. Aurelio, who man aged Mr. Lindsay's 1969 cam paign, declared: “It all sounds like a political prelude to Sen ator Eugene McCarthy's an nouncement of candidacy by some of his long‐committed backers.” The New Democratic Coali tion was formed after the 1968 Democratic National Conven tion, largely from the ranks of those who had campaigned in the primaries for the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Mr. McCarthy, formerly a Sena tor from Minnesota. But Mr. Collins said the let ter to Mayor Lindsay “had nothing to do with the Presi dential aspirations of John Lindsay or Gene McCarthy or anyone else.” The officers who approved the letter, Mr. Collins explained, held a wide range of views on the prospective candidates for President. Of the coalition's 25 officers, 15 attended the Tuesday meeting, he said, and all but one favored sending the letter; the officer who ab stained said he favored a pri vate meeting with the Mayor. The coalition criticized Mr. Lindsay for his stands in three races in the city. It called his endorsement of Millard L. Mid onick for Manhattan Surrogate “far too little, far too late, far too quiet and far too ambigu ous to make any significant dif ference.” “It hardly followed in the tradition of the good‐govern ment battle waged by Senator Kennedy on behalf of Surrogate reform in 1966,” they said. Mr. Midonick won the Dem ocratic primary last month against the regular candidate, State Supreme Court Justice Frederick Backer. The coalition also criticized Mr. Lindsay for failing to sup port Jules Kroll, a reform can didate for City Councilman from Queens. Mr. Kroll lost the primary to a regular, Eugene F. Mastropieri.

552-> Parks Council Fights Fiscal Cuts
Slum children create their own “adventure playground” in the Bronx. A bank on Park Avenue converts its lob by into a miniature park. A colloquium on polluted environ ment is held in the Ethical Cul ture Society and a kite‐flying contest is staged in Battery Park. There is a fiesta in Brook lyn and a walking tour in Cen tral Park. Behind these events, a part of City Parks Week, which be gan last Thursday, is the Parks Council, an organization of public‐spirited persons, which, since 1926, has been the city's unpaid green thumb. As such, the council has been a spearhead in seeking restor ration of the seemingly inevi table budget cuts to meet the city's park and recreation needs. “In a troubled city,” says Edward H. Tuck, president of the council, “this is a cheap way of making people feel bet ter about the city they live in. Improving parks and recrea tion areas affects how they feel about other things as well.” Mr. Tuck estimates that only about nine‐tenths of one per cent of the city's budget now goes for these needs. The cur rent appropriation is $70.3‐mil lion. Though the crisis for parks and recreation is particularly grave this year because of the city's over‐all financial trou bles, the Parks Council has learned that its causes have often been difficult because, for example, it lacks mass pop ular lobbies. It has found that it has often been several years ahead of the city in its pro grams, even when there was no critical shortage of funds. In the nineteen‐twenties, when the city's park system was fragmented and often little more than a rest camp for in competents, the council — it was then the Parks Associa tion of New York City — was pressuring for centralized op eration. At that time, each borough had its own department of parks, except that the Manhat tan department covered Staten Island as well. A result of the council's cam paign for centralization was the formation of a citywide depart ment that Robert Moses headed as he vastly expanded the city's greenery and made the department more efficient. In recent years, however, bureaucracy became top‐heavy and a gap developed between top officials and communities. Pressure built up from the neighborhoods for more power in deciding what they needed. “Centralization was the ap proach in the nineteen‐thirties, but it grew and grew,” said Herschel Post Jr., executive di rector of the council. “Now it is almost dead.” The Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Administration, often working with antipover ty groups, has tried to close the distance between its headquarters and the neighborhoods. At the same time, the Parks Council has become increasing ly active as a bridge between the administration and the coin munities. The “adventure playgrounds” of the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn and the Morrisania area of the Bronx have been by‐products of this approach. These playgrounds, formerly littered lots and abandoned areas, have bloomed into cheer ful oases, with children fash ioning tires, brick, planks into playthings. “With budget cuts slashing away the appropriations for parks,” says Clare Beckhardt, associate director of the Parks Council, “the need is greater and greater for an agency that is an intermediary between public and private sectors.” As part of its mission, the Parks Council has organized op position to the extension of Kennedy International Airport into Jamaica Bay. It has fought the expansion of the Metropoli tan Museum into Central Park. On the positive side, it teas pioneered for the vest‐pocket park in this city, a program that began here about 1964. At that time the Parks Coun cil was working with the Coun cil for Parks and Playgrounds, with which it merged in 1969 to become the Parks Council. “Originally,” recalled Mr. Post, “there was considerable resistance by the city to the idea of creating tiny parks in densely populated areas or in business districts.” Resistance has become fairly common for the Parks Council in its role of advocate of the more liveable city. It was strongly opposed at first when it suggested closing Central Park to traffic. It is still under criticism for having preceded Mayor Lindsay in calling for conversion of midtown avenues into promenades. Necessity has forced the Parks Council to learn tech niques for dramatizing issues. On a recent Saturday, many of its members—and allies from Friends of Central Park—gath ered in a deluge tin Central Park to protest a proposal to expand a fire‐control building. Red tape marked an area that would be denuded of trees. Speakers stood on bench es in the downpour and point ed to a nearby parking that could be used for the new building. And last week, when a news conference was called to rally support for the restoration of budget cuts for parks and rec reation, the council prepared an unusual setting. A section of Central Park was chosen and litter was dumped there to show what the entire park would look like unless more money was appropriated for parks maintenance. Parks Council officials point out that no Federal funds are appropriated for the mainte nance of parks. This is in con trast with the situation during the Depression of the nineteen‐ thirties, when Federal funds paid for a veritable army of men that maintained the parks. “Unless there is more money for parks,” said Mr. Post, “the parks will be math‐balled,”

556-> German Banker Declares U. S. Is Spurring a World Recession
FRANKFURT, West Ger many, Oct. 31—“What we have seen in the last six months con vinces me of only one thing— that we are still capable of making all the mistakes of the nineteen‐thirties. “The whole world is fighting recessionary forces. You can distinguish now only between countries that are already in a recession and those that are five minutes away. What Amer ica is doing is the best way to accelerate recession in the rest of the world.” This is an angry Frankfurt banker speaking. His name is Kurt Richebacher, a director of the Dresdner Bank, the No. 2 bank in West Germany, after the Deutsche Bank. His views as a monetary specialist are considered a little extreme in the intimate banking commu nity, but they are nevertheless listened to with respect. He is a leader of the pessimist school. What draws attention to Mr. Richebacher is that so far this year he has been proved right in his forecasts. He was among the first to talk of a German recession. A distinct slowdown has now been confirmed by many economic indicators. The authorities in the United States and Germany as yet see no evidence. to support the con tention that the world is sliding into recession. In international monetary forums, anxiety over world trends is expressed main ly by the French. France, which has experi enced a remarkable 50 per cent rise in exports since 1969, and which is counting on ex port‐led industrial growth over the next two decades, stands to be particularly hard hit by any recession in Germany. Most of France's export gains have come in car sales to Germany and these are par ticularly vulnerable to changes in economic climate. The conventional wisdom is that the expected recovery in the United States, Britain, Italy and Japan will help stimulate lagging activity in the rest of the world. It Is furthermore pointed out that skillful de mand management policies (easier credit and some fiscal stimulation) will pick up the slack from lost export markets. A top German central banker, who asked not to be cited by name, said, “I am sure the upturn will come in the United States, and I am sure it will be very sizable. I am only uncertain of the timing.” He added that he thought there had also been a “real break through” in decreasing the ex pectations of inflation in the United States. Mr. Richebacher, who has advanced his views in some spirited discussions with other Frankfurt bankers, said in an interview, “We have to dis tinguish between hope and real ity. The difference between of ficial expectations and actual performance over the last half dozen years provides ample justification for belief in a credibility gap.” He argued that the core of the problem today is that every country is fighting to keep up its employment levels. This, he said, is what makes the situa tion comparable to the mone tary and trade struggles of the nineteen‐thirties when all coun tries pulled each other into the abyss. Through exchange‐rate ad justments and trading conces sions the United States wants other countries to help Ameri can exporters.

557-> INVENTORY BUYING IN STEEL GROWING
PITTSBURGH — Jan. 10 — The steel inventory boom was picking up steam last week. “There has been quite a splurge over the past 10 days,” said a mill analyst. A product manager said much the same thing and added that the tone of the market was about to change. Longer lead times will make it impossible for users to rely on rush service for their im mediate needs, he said. Users will be forced to act promptly on their inventory require ments, he predicted. Another official said rising demand has reached the snow balling stage. “I'm sure this is going to become contagious,” he remarked. End to Buyers' Market For some steel users, the end of the buyers' market has been made painfully clear. A pur chasing agent said his com pany's orders for the second quarter had been returned. He said the company had been told it could get its steel in the first quarter but not in the second. Mill officials admitted they were urging customers to begin stockpiling at an early date. Officials said it will be impos sible to provide all the inven tory steel if everyone waits, until spring. Iron Age magazine pointed out that steel mills have been “thinking out” facilities. Some Lines Abandoned Individual mills have been abandoning profitless product lines, Iron Age said. The maga zine said the idea was to con solidate volume through greater specialization. The most conspicuous exam ple of this is in the tinplate market. The supply of tinplate was reduced 7 per cent in 1970 by the decisions of the Inland Steel Company and the Repub lic Steel Corporation to get out of the business. For certain types of container material, this created a very tight balance of supply and de mand. There has also been some backing away from the less expensive types of semi‐finished steel. Domestic mills charge that importers have made a de cided shift toward the higher priced grades. Angle Capacity Seen Domestic officials insist, how ever, that there is ample capac ity to meet all reasonable re quirements in all product lines. Officials say there is not enough capacity to deliver 12 million tons of extra steel a month or two before the Aug. 1 deadline for a mill strike. Among other things, it is point ed out, transportation is a limiting factor. Despite the warnings of steel men, users began their hedge buying in a deliberate fashion. As of last week, mill analysts were predicting shipments of only a little over 7 million tons in January. A mill official said users real ize they can not get last minute service on their inventory steel. It was his opinion that cus tomers have been shopping around in the hope of getting individual producers to finance this stockpiling.

558-> New Pakistani Charge
RAWALPINDI, Pakistan, Dec. 1—Pakistan charged today that Indian reconnaissance planes escorted by fighters flew over West Pakistan yesterday, penetrating “many miles” into the Sialkot region adjoining the frontier. A spokesman here said that there had been other air violations by Indian planes over West Pakistan since the current crisis began Nov. 22, but that yesterday's incident was the most serious. The Indian planes were identified as two Sukhoi‐7 fighterbombers equipped for photo reconnaissance, escorted by two MIG‐21 interceptors. The Pakistani spokesman said fighters pursued the Indian planes, which returned to India with no shots fired on either side. When asked whether Pakistani pilots in West Pakistan are authorized to fire on intruding Indian aircraft, the spokesman declined to reply. A number of air clashes have occurred over East Pakistan, but both sides have so far avoided any kind of fighting in West Pakistan.

559-> Hussein's Overthrow Again Called for by Leftist Guerrilla Leader
BEIRUT, Lebanon, Jan. 17— Dr. George Habash, the left wing Arab guerrilla chief, un derscored the latest split in the Arab commando movement to day by calling for the over throw of King Hussein of Jor dan. Dr. Habash, head of the Popular Front for the Libera tion of Palestine, a Marxist group, asserted in an interview published here that “the Jor danian regime is determined to crush the Palestinian resistance, movement” and said that it should be replaced by a “pro gressive and nonreactionary” Government. The interview appeared in the independent newspaper Al Nahar after a leader of a rival guerrilla group, the middle‐of the road Al Fatah, denounced Dr. Habash at a news confer ence here. The leader, Kemal Adwan, said that Dr. Habash was “an adventurer who wants to compensate for an inferior ity complex.” Dr. Habash's guerrillas, or fedayeen, hijacked three air liners to Jordan last September before the civil war broke out there. He is a physician trained at the American University here, and is said to have been living recently in the northern Jordanian countryside near the village of Dibbin. The doctor's call for King Hussein's overthrow was the front's first such appeal since the September fighting, when he also told his followers that the King must go. But sources close to the Jor danian crown say that the Popular Front and other left wing groups lack the men and the firepower to challenge the Government effectively. In contrast to the Popular Front, Fatah, the largest guer rilla group, does not call for the King's ouster and says it wants no friction with his army. There have been continual tensions between Fatah and the Popular Front. They seem to have reached a high point when Yasir Arafat, the head of Fatah and the Palestine Lib eration organization, which coordinates 10 guerrilla groups, agreed to a commando‐army truce after last week's fighting in Jordan. The Popular Front has ob jected to the truce provision stipulating that part‐time com mandos, or militia, should give up their arms and let them be stored under lock and key in commando arsenals. Many commandos charge that King Hussein's Govern ment has been deliberately breaking past truce agree ments between the Govern ment and the guerrillas in or der to deal the commandos lethal blow. Highly Placed Palestinians critical of the commandos said that the division within the movement had been precipi tated in part by recent army pressure. Palestine Liberation Organ ization leaders identified with Fatah have taken a relatively conciliatory line toward the King's Government. But Dr. Habash's view expressed in the Al Nahar interview was that the guerrilla movement had erred for years “in the illusion that it was capable of waging the fighting against the Israeli enemy within the framework of peaceful coexistence with the reactionary regime in Jordan.” Dr. Habash said that a pre requisite for victory over the King was national unity, but he termed “wrong and imprac tical” an effort to try to com bine all the various commando groups into a single integrated superorganization. This had been the hope of some com mandos, who felt that disunity and disorganization had left them ill‐equipped to face the army's attacks in Amman in September. After the Palestine Liberation Organization agreed to last week's truce, the Popular Front dissented loudly. Its spokesman said that it would forcibly re sist if someone tried to take the militia's arms away. Popular Front officials are not saying how many men the group now has under arms. Formerly it was widely reported to have about 3,000 fighters, but its critics now contend that many of these have left the ranks since the September fighting. Kemal Adwan, the Fatah leader, yesterday said that the Popular Front had only 5 per cent of Fatah's strength and that in his Jordanian hideaway Dr. Habash was in effect under the Fatah protection. Informed Palestinian estimates put Fa tah's strength at 10,000 com mandos. Mr. Adwan also suggested that there had been collusion between the crown and the Popular Front, whose actions he said had provided the King with excuses to crack down.

561-> U.S. ASSAILS CHINA AS ‘INTEMPERATE’ IN SPEECH AT U.N.
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Nov. 16—The United States denounced China today as having used “intemperate language” and “empty cannons of rhetoric” in the speech yesterday that marked Peking's entry into the United Nations. This assessment of the Chinese policy address—given in a brief statement approved by the White House and issued this evening by George Bush, the chief American delegate to the United Nations—perplexed many foreign diplomats. The general view here was that Chiao Kuan‐hua, the leader of the Chinese delegation, had delivered a relatively moderate speech that, according to many diplomats, seemed more to challenge Soviet positions than American positions in the world, notably in the Middle East. Delegates Surprised Western European delegates who read Mr. Bush's statement, distributed 24 hours after the Chinese speech, expressed surprise that the United States replied so sharply to the Chinese. They also noted that Mr. Bush's statement was issued after the Chinese ignored an opportunity to attack the United States. Huang Hua, the regular Chinese representative, spoke today to explain his “yes” vote after the General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution of caution to Washington for moving to import chrome from Rhodesia in violation of a United Nations ban. But Mr. Huang did not attack the United States. [Details, Page 14.] Other Methods Discussed American sources said that the Administration had decided that a statement by Mr. Bush would be the most discreet way of replying to Mr. Chiao after Washington concluded that it could not let Peking's criticism of American policies go unanswered. It was understood that the Administration had considered but discarded the possibility of a speech in the General Assembly or of a statement to be issued in Washington by either the White House or the State Department. In view of President Nixon's plan to visit Peking in 1972, the Administration was described as seeking to strike a balance between its reluctance to offend the Chinese and its desire to respond to the Chiao speech, partly to placate United States conservative factions, already bitter over the policies toward China. Mr. Bush issued his statement after returning to New York from a day‐long visit to Washington. “Yesterday's inaugural address of the representative of the People's Republic of China was a disappointment for all those who wish to see the United Nations promote the goals of peace and progress. “There was nothing new in the intemperate language—the phrases are familiar to those who have seen the standard propaganda of the People's Republic of China. What was surprising — and disturbing —was the decision to launch participation in this world body by firing these empty cannons of rhetoric. “Without mutual respect and a serious attempt to narrow differences, little can be done to reduce the turmoil in the world and to meet the aspirations of its peoples. This will be the approach of the United States Government.” What precisely had disturbed the Administration was not clear from the statement. But American officials said privately that Washington took exception to Mr. Chiao's comments on a variety of topics ranging from denunciations of resolutions on Korea approved by the United Nations 20 years ago, to his support of a Latin‐American claim to a 200‐mile limit of territorial waters. The United States opposes this claim, and officials said that Mr. Chiao's endorsement was more offensive to the United States than his “obvious” demand for the departure of American forces from Indochina. Challenge to Soviet Seen Earlier in the day, numerous diplomats expressed the view that China had directly challenged the Soviet Union's political position in the Middle East and thus injected a new element in that situation. This challenge was contained in Mr. Chiao's attack on the “superpowers” for engaging in “political deals” behind the backs of the Arab people. The Soviet Union and the United States are both involved in the Middle East. But diplomats said the Chinese appeared to be centering their fire on the Russians as part of a campaign to undermine Soviet Influence in the region. Diplomats said they believed that Mr. Chiao's speech made it clear that Peking had no intention of joining efforts to seek a solution for the Middle East. In the past, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France have held joint consultations on this problem, and Western diplomats had wondered what Peking's attitude would be. An Eastern European diplomat said that Peking was forcing “revolutionary” rhetoric into the Middle Eastern dispute. But, he said, the object of this policy was chiefly to erode the Soviet position in the Middle East rather than create serious, new problems. Diplomats from Eastern and Western Europe and the Middle East singled out the passage on the Middle East as one of the politically most significant of the speech. Its significance, they said, arises from their assessment that the Middle East is the most important active dispute pending before the Security Council and the General Assembly on which the Peking delegation may soon have to take a stand. Diplomats said that the rest of Mr. Chiao's address, which most delegates considered restrained, was reaffirmation of known Peking positions with a special emphasis on support for the “third world” and the invocation of international law as a basis of mainland China's claim to Taiwan. No immediate practical action is required in the United Nations on the other topics discussed by Mr. Chiao—from disarmament to Korea—but Eastern European diplomats in particular interpreted the Chinese speech yesterday as a frontal thrust at the Soviet efforts to maintain a central role in the Middle East through, the alliance with Egypt.

563-> Restructuring Deemed An Urban ‘Imperative’
As educational and social institutions, the schools of big‐city America are in serious trouble. The educational problem is exempli fied most readily by the record of aca demic failure that is built every day by large numbers of urban youth—a chronic trouble historically. The social dimension of the trouble is seen most easily by the increasing demand for police and civilian guards to maintain order in many city schools. Thus do the schools not only display their educa tional troubles, but also reflect serious social illness; and thus do the problems of the society help to dramatize, by the stationing of guards in the schools, the inherently compulsory nature of schooling. Some of the troubles of the schools will be resolved only when the social ills of the nation are cured. But many other troubles—of an educational nature —will remain until the schools begin to reshape themselves in a number of fun damental ways. Basic change in the style and content of the schools—in the way education is defined, measured and packaged—is im perative. On that, there is relatively little disagreement. The disagreement is over the kind of change. Does school disruption, for example, demand more security guards— or better and more varied educational programs and improved counseling serv ices, as well as schools (and a society) that more clearly practice all the rules of democracy? There is, moreover, un certainty over how much basic change is possible. In short, the question that confronts urban public education is not whether to change, but what to change, and how to secure a wide enough consensus to accomplish any reforms at all without irreparably damaging the fragile concept of public education in the process. Essentially, two kinds of reform are possible. The first is the kind that was sought with a burst of energy and good intention in the nineteen‐sixties. Then, with a substantially increased spending power, the schools reformed large ele ments of the curriculum, most notably in mathematics and the physical sci ences; established and intensified all kinds of new programs for special groups of youngsters, from the poor to the creative and the handicapped; purchased more and newer kinds of classroom equipment; constructed hun dreds of modern (though often tradi tional) school buildings, and assembled larger and more specialized staffs. The nature and scope of the effort raises the question of whether, as a result, education came to he overprofessionalized and overspecialized. The second kind of reform—and the kind most needed today—is less tangible and more radical. It would strike not at the trappings on the periphery of education, but at the heart of the learning process. It would seek to deal directly with how youngsters learn, and thus with how (for good and ill) the schools devise and revise the learning environment. Stereotypes Challenged The language would include options, alternatives, flexibility, diversity, indivi duality, choice and institutional self renewal. The goal would bo to destroy stereotypes on which many (perhaps most) schools presently tend to operate; that learning and education are the ex clusive domain of the schools; that knowledge is dispensed exclusively by the teacher; that learning is confined to the age span of five to eighteen, the hours of 9 to 3, five days of the week and ten months of the year; that Fact is logically divisible into permanent aca demic compartments; that education con sists of the taking of courses and the accumulation of credits; and that schools planned and managed by adults, are rightfully empowered to determine the student's path to becoming educated. Reform in the nineteen‐seventies ought to be directed at the structures and the systems of education. If the kind of reform undertaken in the nineteen‐six ties proved anything, it proved that for all the spending and all the effort, and despite the successes that were achieved, the basic character of the schools was changed very little. Labels Unimportant At the elementary level, we need first to identify those specific though broadly defined provisions that are es sential to learning, and then to con struct programs including those provi sions. It is not the label of the pro gram—the British infant school, the open classroom, Montessori, the “traditional” school—that is critical. It is wheth er the program—whatever its label— is conducive to learning and human growth. We need to decide whether we be lieve it is imperative to inculcate in dividual responsibility and a sense of dignity and self‐respect; whether we want teachers to teach at youngsters, or to enable them to learn; whether we believe learning is a matter of discov ery or indoctrination; whether we be lieve schools should foster personal di versity, or homogeneity; whether we be lieve learning is a part of growing up, or a separate experience and thus prop erly institutionalized in the school; whether we will tolerate and compen sate for differences in learning rates and learning styles; and whether we will seek to capitalize on the proven fact that students of all ages learn a great deal from each other, both in and beyond the classroom. There is nothing “wrong” with tra ditional classrooms except that there are too many of them—or, to put it another way, too few alternatives to them. More Options Needed The traditional style of teaching can be as effective as any other kind, and it is—for many kids. But there are other ways of teaching, too, and given the diversity of students in this country, particularly in the cities, there is good reason to provide a variety of kinds of classrooms, and to let the parents, with counsel and advice from the school, pick and choose among them. At the secondary school level, reform ought to be directed at the educational bill of fare. More options, more alterna tives should be the goal. Since students are individuals, there is every reason to provide individualized programs of learning, especially in the high schools where students have some sense of personal interest and a moderately de veloped style of learning. If a student learns best by working, let him work. If he learns well independ ently, set him free with a program planned in cooperation with his school. If he would benefit by a year away from school, let him, with his parents' per mission, travel or work; and on his re entry into the classroom, let his experi ence be given appropriate academic credit. Are we in the business of granting diplomas on the basis of years in school or acquired knowledge? The answer is all too obvious, and that precisely is the reason that the system of granting credit needs drastic and immediate re vision, as does the pattern of programs on which the credit system rests. There are critics who say the schools are oppressive, inflexible and monopo listic. And there are many parents in many communities, especially in the heart of the cities, who say the schools are bureaucratic and unresponsive. The criticism is too widespread and too deeply felt to be ignored or brushed aside. ‘Life‐Force’ at Work The level of dissatisfaction with the schools of the cities is too high, and probably growing. The schools, as a re sult, are in pain. But pain, at least, is evidence of life. As Gloria Channon, a New York City teacher, has said, turmoil and dis satisfaction and disruption are not all destructive and all dangerous. For they represent, she said, “the life‐force which is exploding from our dry, long‐buried, long‐dormant seed, the life‐force that threatens us with salvation.” The point is that the articulation of dissatisfaction is the prerequisite to change, and that the discontented so ciety is usually the society that pos sesses the capacity for self‐criticism and the will to progress. In the cities, the salvation of public education demands rapid changes in or ganizational structure, school policy, course content, the style of teaching and learning, and the systematic pat tern of programs that schooling present ly comprises. It demands acceptance of the basic concepts that education antedates and transcends the school, that school ef fectiveness is in part a product of school responsiveness, that diversity of pro gram is a legitimate institutional goal, and that the overriding priority in all matters of educational policy is the welfare of the learner. If the schools of the cities are to be radically altered in structure and style in the seventies, it will be the result of collaborative efforts among classroom teachers and policy‐makers, school people and laymen, politicians, commu nity groups, critics and students. At least in the schools of the cities, I see little possibility of imposing pro grams of reform, however progressive, from the top by administrative fiat. Nor do I see much chance of wide spread change at the grassroots level of the classroom, until teachers sense that they have the freedom to change without fear of subtle (or‐not‐so‐subtle) punishment. No matter how determined and skilled the classroom teacher, un less the atmosphere in the schools en courages change and tolerates the as sociated risks, the influence of inhibi tion is likely to prevail. I suspect that collaboration for change will tend to be more pragmatic than ideological, and that it will develop is sue by issue. New kinds of teacher train ing will have its advocates; new kinds of programs will have others; new sys tems of school governance will have still others. But in the schools of the cities, it seems likely that group effort will be required. For the stakes of fundamental reform and the political nature of the populous city virtually ensure that teachers, policymakers, parents and citizen groups can no longer go it alone with the expectation of producing change that will directly touch life in the classroom.

564-> Reserve Aide Tells N.A.A.C.P. Blacks' Job Outlook Is Gloomy
MINNEAPOLIS, July 6 — A leading Negro economist pre dicted hepe today that it would be “quite some time” before there would be any improve ment in the employment situa tion for black Americans. Dr. Andrew F. Brimmer, the lone black member of the board of governors of the Federal Re serve System, said that the pic ture was now so bleak that many blacks had “given up” and no longer even bothered to enter the labor force. He said it was essential that the Federal Government act im mediately and suggested that the public payroll be used to provide immediate jobs. “The main thing,” he de clared, “is that they do some thing.” Dr. Brimmer, in an address to the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said that, while the “vast pro portion of black people still do not have marketable skills,” others were doing “reasonably well.” “In fact,” he went on, “they're doing a hell of a lot better than any of us thought they would do.” But he said that this troubled him. “This is why I am afraid of a schism [among blacks] developing,” he declared. “If you go through and look at what has been happening in some of the professional categories and so on, a handful of black people have moved out ahead.” As a result, Dr. Brimmer said it could only be expected that this situation was leading to ward a schism between pre pared blacks and unprepared blacks. He said that this division was already substantial enough in my judgment to pose a series problem and one which would, in my judgment, convince us that we really ought to get on with trying to do something about job opportunities. Dr. Brimmer declared, “We may end up even in the black community with a large body of underclass people, sort of people on the fringes of things with no real opportunity to participate in what actually is going to be substantial econom ic expansion over the decade.” In his speech he also said he was “particularly distressed” by what he described as the declining emphasis on job op portunity, in contrast to a ris ing demand for expanded op portunities for blacks to own and manage their own busi nesses. “In expressing this concern,” he said, “I must hasten to add that, while I personally have serious reservations about many of the numerous pro grams aimed, hopefully, at in creasing business ownership by blacks, I believe that those black men and women who are convinced that they can suc ceed in business should have a chance to try their luck.” Dr. Brimmer, who was nomi nated to the Reserve Board by President Johnson in 1966, was more pessimistic when he dis cussed the short‐term outlook for blacks. “Unemployment among Ne groes climbed relatively more slowly than it did for all work ers during the recent reces sion,” he said. “But the level for blacks is still almost double that for the total labor force.” I3e added, “Reflecting the un certain prospects for the total economy, I believe we should not expect to see a significant improvement in the employ ment situation for blacks, or for the total labor force, for quite some time.” Dr. Brimmer said that, in view of the situation, he per sonally saw “a good deal of merit in the suggestions which hold that the economy does re quire an extra boost at this time,” He suggested some kind of wage and price restraints say ing, “At the Federal level, the main thing is that we do some thing and do it now.” In discussing the long‐range outlook for blacks, Dr. Brimmer painted a different picture. “As I look ahead to the Ne gro's employment prospects in the current decade, I am barely optimistic,” he said. He pre dicted that by 1980 there should be about 12 million Negroes in the labor force, constituting 12 per cent of the total. “The projection for the na tional economy as a whole sug gests that the outlook for blacks will brighten considerably,” he said, “if they can prepare them selves to take advantage of the emerging openings.” Considering this, he asserted that improvement in the educa tional attainment of the black community would be crucial. He said that in the nineteen seventies there would be a sharp increase in the demand for highly trained workers. “But, at the same time,” he said, “we can also expect dramatic shift in the types of skills required. This prospect will be of critical importance to the black students.” The Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, founder and chairman of the Opportunities Industrialization Centers, was the recipient of the N.A.A.C.P. Spingarn Medal for 1970. Mr. Sullivan, a Baptist clergy man from Philadelphia who be came the first black man to serve on the board of directors of the General Motors Corpora tion, called for closer coopera tion among black people and for greater self sufficiency. He cau tioned blacks against overde pendence on government to provide jobs and training. The award, given annually to an outstanding contributor to the civil rights of blacks in America, is named for Arthur Spingarn and the late Joel Spin garn, philanthropists Who were presidents of the N.A.A.C.P. board.

565-> Phone Rate Hearings To Start on March 16
ALBANY, March 1 — The State Public Service Commis sion ordered hearings to be gin here on March 16 on the New York Telephone Com pany's request for a 29.1 per cent rate increase, which would produde $391‐million annually, in additional reve nue. The commission said that the increase could not go into effect until after the hear ings, at which the company must prove that the increase would be justified. Among the factors to be considered, the commission said, is the quality of tele phone service, which William H. Ellinghaus, president of the utility, has admitted is “not up to our standards.” The proposed increase is the largest single rise that the company has ever re quested. But Mr. Ellinghaus contended in his petition for approval of the increase that it was vital if service was not to deteriorate further.

566-> Gardens
SNUGGLED high on Cape Cod bluff looking out across Vineyard Sound to Martha's Vineyard is a magnificent preRevolutionary house. Nestled around it are black pines, sassafras, junipers and two marvelous old apple trees. A huge pair of boxwood are by the front door, another pair of Japanese hollies trim the terrace door and in a corner is a cluster of fine old‐fashioned New England lilacs. Down in the woods, where a sandy path leads to the beach, the dogtooth violets are just coming into bloom and fresh green fronds if ferns are everywhere. This delightful spot is home for Charlotte and George C. Whiteley Jr., a Charming couple that have made a graceful transition from the academic world to active retirement. They have settled into their new lifestyle with enthusiasm. Having retired three years ago from the Hill School, in PottstOwn, Pa., as head of the Science Department, George Whiteley has now shifted from his love of teaching and working with young men to his own boyhood first love, the sea. A marine biologist by formal training, he pursues a favorite hobby, gardening, with the typical keenness of a scientist, observing, asking questions and finding answers. And right by his side, his wife, Charlotte, pursues, with equal absorption, her fondness for scented plants, herbs, which usually end up in the kitchen. She has been quite active in the Philadelphia branch of the Herb Society of America. Supporting his wife's hobby, George Whiteley said, “Why herbs lift ordinary hamburger to high excellence.” “This spring, everything is about two weeks late,” he bemoaned as we all looked Out over the misty, foggy sound beyond. But the garden showed evidences that the spring planting ritual had begun. And the head of the manor had some fascinating tips for newcomers who plant by the sea. At the top of the list of plants most likely to succeed is Russian olive. “It doubles its height in just a few years, although at first you don't think it will ever grow.” Close to it in esteem is Japanese black pine. “The house has been through three hurricanes. That bluff is a 30foot drop to the sea and it has been battened down with Japanese black pines and they are holding. Just, a few weeks ago we had a terrible wind storm. Our neighbor's instruments clocked winds at 85 miles an hour. it takes tough plants to come through that,” he said. Other Whiteley Plant favorites are the native rose, Rosa rugosa, Amur privet, honeysuckle and lilac. But the key to success is soil management. “It definitely pays to add humus to the soil,” says Whiteley. He also puts great stress on a high phosphorus‐potash fertilizer. He has found one with a 4‐1816 formula which does a good job. The humus supply comes naturally. “The state passed a no ‐leaf ‐burning law, so composting is an easy way to solve the disposal problem,” he said. The Whiteley way is practical. He simply makes a circle of snow fencing, sets it up in an out‐ofthe ‐way corner of the grounds and tosses in grass clippings, leaves, cut flowers when faded and prunings. From time to time he adds a supply of nitrogen to keep the microorganisms that break down the compost thriving. In two or three years, the material is all rotted down. Seaweed, too, goes on the compost, provided it is “the stuff tossed up on the beach and not right from the water.” The salt content is negligible. When the compost is all rotted down, it is put through a new four‐horsepower grinder and chopped up. One soil test, “If the earthworms are happy, then the soil is good,” he said. Evidently the Whiteley soil is just about perfect, for the earthworms are there in abundance. Here are a few more rules for seaside planters. Dried cow manure is a good soil conditioner. Top dressing of mulch plus tree bark keeps down weeds and holds in moisture. Watering is essential — once a week on a regular schedule for lawns and every two weeks for roses. In the seaside dampness, black spot is a rose problem, so the Whiteleys spray weekly to protect the foliage. And finally, George White ley philosophizes, “Plants are like people in a way. Just don't fuss over them.”

567-> This Period of Ferment May Be a Turning Point
Fifty or a hundred years hence his torians may well call the decade from 1965 to 1975 a turning point in the history of American education. In any case, the pressures for change seem unprecedented. We may now be living through a time of ferment as significant as the common school revival of the mid‐19th century or the progressive education movement that emerged in the early 20th century. Now as then, we find a profusion of educational muckrakers, a flamboyant rhetoric of indictment and promise, a mushrooming of new organizations bent on reform and prickly defensive ness from those threatened by change. Today, however, many critics urge not simply the reform of existing schools but the reshaping of educational struc tures and processes. Some argue that free education should be the right of every child re gardless of whether or not he goes to a private or a public school. Minorities demand forms of community control that would profoundly alter school bureaucracies. Students and teachers reach for power long denied them. And today the mass media and the youth culture are shattering the conventional notion that “education” is something that only takes place between teachers and students in classrooms. Evolutionary Changes Change in American public education has normally been evolutionary rather than sudden and dramatic. It is true that sometimes there have been sharp shifts of fashion in educational rhetoric, but one can no more trust educational pronouncements as a sure key to behavior in classrooms than political platforms as a guide to politi cal reality. Despite these shifts in rhetoric, edu cators have in the past usually made two assumptions now being questioned: that schooling is the major means of social renewal; and that schooling is best served by granting more power to the professional. Within the gradual development of public schooling, it is possible to discern certain stages of reform. A critical early phase was the common school movement of the 19th century as sym bolized by Horace Mann and his col leagues. The language used to describe this stage—“crusade,” “revival”—re veals its evangelical character. Basically, Mann and fellow advocates sought to articulate and focus the diffuse American faith in education and to make it relevant to the anxieties and aspirations of their age. In place of other models of education, such as the voluntary benevolent societies or the highly decentralized and diverse dis trict schools, the reformers sought to substitute a pattern of uniform and state‐supervised schooling. In so doing, they gave form and con tent to the ideal of the common school —an institution that was to be public in control and support, free, and of such high quality that parents could desire no other. Bereft of formal power to achieve his goal, Mann faced the task of “arousing and guiding public sentiment in relation to the practical interests of schooling.” ‘The One Best System’ Less charismatic than the common school crusaders, leading school admin istrators in the latter half of the 19th century tried to discover and implement “the one best system,” whether of clas sification of pupils, ventilation, standard ized examinations, curriculum, or the training, certification and supervision of teachers. Cities took the lead in this process of piecemeal bureaucratization, al though at the turn of the century schoolmen discovered “The Rural Prob lem” and tried to standardize and con solidate education in the countryside by eliminating one‐teacher schools. Although leaders succeeded to a de gree in standardizing the schools, and thereby in homogenizing the behavior of students, they faced serious political problems. Because laymen retained much administrative control through their large central or ward boards of educa tion, superintendents often found that they did not fully control either jobs or money. Herein lay the chief motives for the centralization of education, an attempt to “take the schools out of politics” and thereby to delegate power to the professionals. At the turn of the century an influ ential alliance of local élites and leading schoolmen sought to reduce the size of school boards and to change their func tion essentially to that of legitimizing the decisions of the superintendent and his staff. Of course patronage and outside in fluence did not disappear entirely from education, but the growth of large cen tral bureaucracies and the demise of local ward boards increasingly turned the schools into a “closed system” in which students and their parents be came more subjects than citizens of the educational World. Thus structural changes such as decentralization or community control today represent at tempts to reform an earlier reform. Along with this administrative brand of “progressivism,” which resembled élite urban reform generally, came an other version of educational “progressi vism” based on philosophical and psy chological theories, notably those of John Dewey. The aim of these educational re formers was to alter the rigid curric ulum and teaching methods to fit education more closely to the child, his interests, his social activities, and the new industrial and urban world about him. They sought to break down the walls between school and society. Eager to humanize industry, they believed that the traditional school served instead to industrialize humanity. Their theories seemed to work best in small private schools and in élite suburbs, although some urban teachers adopted them. Dewey had redefined the role of the common school to rescue it from the desiccation of a reform movement gone stale, but often his ideas were institu tionalized in urban bureaucracies by persons who only half understood them. Until recently, reformers sought— and largely achieved—more power for the professional leader. They promised accountability and social renewal as a result. Today, amid challenges coming both from outside and within the sys tem, educators find it difficult to direct, predict, contain, or co‐opt the new forces for change. Although it has been customary in America to see educational measures— say a new course in driver education —as the answer to a social problem, now many disfranchised groups regard the schools themselves as part of the social problem. If earlier reforms are today the object of attack, it is in part because sub stantial segments of this society no longer believe in centralism as an effec tive response to human needs, no longer trust in professionalism, no longer ac cept the Inevitability or justice of the distribution of power and wealth along existing class and racial lines, and no longer think that technological change implies progress. To whom and for what purpose edu cation should be accountable today remains the sharpest question, and on the answer depends much of the schools’ role in social renewal.

568-> Nation
The Nobel Prize for literature may be the highest award for writing, but it keeps going to Japanese, Swedes, Yugoslays, Icelanders and Finns — people who can't write a simple English sentence and don't sell very well in this country. For American book publishers and booksellers, this is not only persistently painful but occasion ally untranslatable. It does little to keep them solvent. So, since 1950, this book community, in an exercise of Nobelesse oblige has been giving National Book Awards to authors. (and transla tors) of certified United States nationality, publishing in the U. S. of. A. Each year memorable books get less than their just reward (each prize is a mere $1,000), and the whole procedure gets more confusing. In the past, judges for the National Book Awards have put together their own lists of finalists in each cate gory and chosen the winners from their own lists. This year, to satisfy those displeased with such elitist nomination routine, ballots went to about 200 mem bers of the National Book Com mittee, and to more than 300 other critics, book editors, book sellers and public librarians round the nation. About 275 returned the ballots. naming favorites in seven cate gories: Arts and Letters, Chil dren's Books, Fiction, History and Biography, Poetry, the Sci ences and Translation. Twenty five distinguished judges took over from there. Instead of passively accepting the worst (and following the rules), the judges revolted at choices made for reasons of com merce no less than art. And so, without one panel telling another that revolt was in the air, Fiction, Poetry, Arts and Letters and the Sciences refused to swallow the lists they were given. The three‐man poetry panel threw out every nomination— including Ezra Pound and John Berryman. “These were nomina tions people made simply on the basis of general reputations,” complained poetry judge W. D. Snodgrass. Added Allen Ginsberg, his col league on the panel: “If we should pick the most sublime voices/we should take respon sibility for our choices./I quar relled/and wanted my dearest beloveds laurelled.” Exercising poetic license, Mr. Ginsberg decided (with his two colleagues) to put together a worthy list in place of the un worthy one. To get his mind into judicious bind he began each judging day in the very same way: “I sit morning hour/medi tate upon youth/Nixon's spinal column/empty nature of truth.” Fiction was stranger than truth. The five judges selecting the best novel decided to reject the nomination of Erich Segal's “Love Story.” Said judge William Styron: “I don't consider myself better qualified than anybody else, but I do know a mediocre book when I see it. I think [Mr. Segal] must be aware himself that his book is not in the same league with Eudora Welty or Saul Bellow.” Mr. Segal was not even in the same country. He was in Japan when the judgment fell, and the verdict seemed particularly harsh, for he himself is a judge in Arts and Letters. His reaction was that “Love Story” had pleased millions who had seen the book and read the movie, and that the judges, well—”May be their motives were pure but they didn't have to be so voci ferous.” Talk of judiciousness and rules of civil procedure puzzled Lillian Hellman (Arts and Letters). “I don't think I have any experience that prepares me for judicious ness,” she said. “It's a funny word to use about literature. I guess what you should do about literature is feel it and have a little taste—not think of it as legal case. It ain't.” By last week the judges had winnowed their lists of 10 down to five. The single winner in each category is to be announced on March 2, and that book's sales may be expected to soar, or per haps simply to tremble upward; publishers differ on how effective the prizes are in the count that rewards. And then next year procedures will be revised yet again. “We will hope that we have learned something from this experience,” said a committee spokesman, “but I doubt it.”

569-> U.S. TIGHTENS RULE ON FREE WITCHES
A new Federal regulation will cut off free lunches for 350,000 of the 390,000 city school children now getting these lunches, the head of the program said yesterday. Julius Jacobs, director of the Board of Education's Bureau of School Lunches, said in an interview it wuld cost about $40‐million a year to continue the frees lunches for those pupils. He said he did not know if the city or the state would be willing to provide that amount. Under a regulation announced by the Department of Agriculture last Tuesday, the eligibility ceiling has been dropped to $3,940 for a family of four. New York has been using an income ceiling of $4,250 for such a family. In tightening a rule on eligibility, the Department of Agriculture at the same time liberalized Federal payments to states under the school lunch program, increasing a proposed level of 35 cents a meal to 45 cents a meal, 1 cent short of the level that had been approved by the Senate last week. While the Department of Agriculture has estimated that 7.3 million of the nation's school children are getting either free or reduced‐price lunches under its program, Congressional leaders have been sharply critical of the new eligibility ruling. Mr. Jacobs described the new regulation as a “disaster,” asking, “How can children learn with empty stomachs?” Another Board of Education official, Walter Scully, assistant director of the lunch program, also warned of a “disastrous effect” on the children. “This is a bad dream,” said Mr. Jacobs, “a nightmare. We press hard for Congress to press for increased payments for lunch, and along comes this regulation to negate advances.” Mr. Jacobs said he had been in touch with officials of the Department of Agriculture concerning the date when the new regulation would be effective. He said he was pessimistic on the possibility that there might be some relaxation of the new regulation. Mr. Jacobs based his $42‐million estimate on what he said was a “rough calculation” that the free lunches cost 50 cents each and were served 185 days during the school year. He said lunches were served to 450,000 pupils in the public schools here, with about 60,000 of them paying for the meal. The Federal subsidy of 35‐cents for 350,000 meals 185 days a year would total $227‐million. He said he would meet with officials of the Board of Education this week on the problem. Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, and Representative Carl D. Perkins of Kentucky, chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, another Democrat, estimated that under the new restriction, about one million children nationwide would be forced out of the lunch program. Both pointed out that about 40 states and the District of Columbia had used levels higher than the official $3,940 Federal level to determine eligibility. Philip Olsson, deputy Assistand secretary of Agriculture, said that the new restriction was aimed at stopping school districts from raising their poverty levels “so that more names can be added to lunch rolls, resulting in the Government paying for the program.”

570-> Conferees Request Nixon's Approval For Alaska A‐Test
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 (AP)—Senate‐House conferees agreed today to a bill provi sion that would postpone a scheduled five‐megaton nuclear warhead underground explosion in Alaska unless President Nix on gave his direct approval. In approving a compromise public works appropriation bill, the conferees accepted Senate provision to forbid the explosion before May 31, 1972, “unless the President gives his direct approval.” The Atomic Energy Commis sion has planned the experi ment in the Aleutian Islands for some time next month. The ex Periment is designed to test the warhead of the Spartan mis sile, a part of the Safeguard Antiballistic Missile System. A White House spokesman said there would be no im mediate comment on the con ferees’ action. He said, as other Adminis tration spokesmen and Mr. Nix on have said in the past, that the matter remains under re view. He added that the experi ment had not been canceled, nor has a final go‐ahead been given. Discussion has been going on for months, but recent devel opments have added another complication from the diplomat ic standpoint. Some Senators have said that the blast, a mile underground with the force of 5 million tons of TNT, might touch off earth quakes and tidal waves. Details of the compromise amounts of money for various projects in the bill were not made public immediately.

571-> Who Elected The Times?
The public reaction to the publica tion of the Pentagon Papers has been overwhelmingly on the side of the newspapers, but there is a strong and vehement view that it is wrong, dan gerous and even criminal for a news paper to assume responsibility for publishing private official documents without the consent of the Govern ment. Who, it is asked, elected The New York Times? How can outsiders judge better than the official insiders What damage may be done by publication of secret documents? By what right do newspapers presume to print official information which may embarrass the Government and give comfort to the enemy? These are serious questions which deserve serious answers, for it is clear that the publication of the Pentagon Papers has embarrassed the Govern ment, disclosed evidence of official de ception, and in the process provided Hanoi, Moscow and Peking with mate rial for anti‐American propaganda. At first glance, it is a devastating Indictment, but should documents not be published because they embarrass the Government? Nobody is arguing that newspapers have the right to publish the nation's war plans or troop movements, or anything else that would endanger the lives of the men in the American expeditionary force. But historical documents? Evidence that the Congress and the people were misled years ago—even if this embar rasses the Government and provides propaganda for the enemy? This is clearly another matter. After all, every time Mike Mansfield, the opposition leader in the Senate, calls on the Government to end the war by a date certain, or any newspa per or preacher or group of citizens condemns the bombing or questions the loss of life or the diversion of resources, or what the war is doing to divide and weaken the nation—all this is picked up by our adversaries and used against the United States. Should we then suppress the docu ments because they “embarrass” the Government? Deceive the people about the record of the war? Submit to the Government's argument that publica tion will cause “irreparable injury” to the national defense rather than “irre parable injury” to the nation's reputa tion for fair dealing and plain and honest speaking to the Congress and the people? Confuse “embarrassment” to the Government and its officials with the security of the Republic? In the absence of clear evidence that publication of these old documents is truly a threat to the defenses of the nation—which the Government has not provided—these are good political but bad philosophical and historical ques tions. Still, they are being raised by influential men and they come closer to the Marxist view of the press—that it should be a servant of the govern ment—than to the American view of the press as defined in the First Amendment. It is not good enough to suppress facts relating to the past, as distin guished from dangerous military infor mation affecting the present or future on the ground that this may be awk ward. This comes close to Nikolai Lenin's view of the press. “Why should freedom of speech and freedom of press be allowed?” he asked in 1920. “Why should a government which is doing what it believes to be right allow itself to be criticized? It would not allow opposition by lethal weapons. Ideas are much more lethal than guns. Why should any man be allowed to buy a printing press and disseminate pernicious opinions calcu lated to embarrass the government?” Well, many men who oppose publi cation of the Pentagon Papers don't go this far, but the violent opponents of publication, like Herbert Rainwater, the national commander of the Veter ans of Foreign Wars, who is crying “treason,” come very close to the Lenin thesis that opposition to the Govern ment is unpatriotic or worse. It is true that newspaper editors, raised in the American tradition of “publish and be damned,” do not always know what damage they may do to the diplomatic process by pub lishing official documents. Their infor mation is limited, and no doubt the official insiders know more than the outsiders, but even this is a dubious argument. As Walter Lippmann wrote many years ago, you had better be careful not to go too far with the “insiders” argument. “For if you go on,” he told the National Press Club in Washington on his 70th birthday in 1960, “you will be showing how ridiculous it is that we live in a republic under a demo cratic system, and that anyone should be allowed to vote. “You will be denouncing the prin ciple of democracy itself, which asserts that the outsiders shall be sovereign over the insiders. For you will be showing that the people, since they are ignoramuses, because they are outsid ers, are therefore incapable of govern ing themselves. “If the country is to be governed with the consent of the governed, then the governed must arrive at opinions about what their governors want them to consent to…Here we corre spondents perform an essential service. In some field of interest, we make it our business to find out what is going on under the surface and beyond the horizon… “In this we do what every sovereign citizen is supposed to do, but has not the time or the interest to do for him self. This is our job. It is no mean calling. We have a right to be proud of it, and to be glad that it is our work.”

572-> SUSPECT SLAIN HERE TIED TO SKYJACKING
A fingerprint check yesterday revealed that a young man shut to death by a policeman on Wednesday after an at tempted bank holdup on the Upper East Side was wanted by the Federal Bureau of In vestigation as a plane hijacker. The dead man, who was first identified as Daniel Grant, turned out to be Tyrone Elling ton Austin, 22 years old. Ac cording to F.B.I. records, Austin was wanted as a fugitive in the skyjacking of an Eastern Airlines jet to Cuba in January, 1969. His wife, Lynda, 21, was also being sought in the case. Austin was shot by Patrol man Raymond Nardello shortly after lie reportedly held up the Manufacturers Hanover Bank branch at 1429 First Avenue, near 74th Street, and fled with $6,104. The police said they later found in Austin's car a quantity of Black Panther party literature. The police said Austin was known in the party under a variety of aliases. According to the police, Austin and his wife had gone from Cuba to Spain and later had re‐entered the United States from Canada.

573-> A Mother's. Rights to Child Challenged
ALBANY, March 1 — The State Court of Appeals was asked today to order a rehear ing a 9‐month‐old girl who has been ordered returned to her natural mother. The lawyer for Mr. and Mrs. Nicholas De Martino of Brook Lyn said his clients should have had an opportunity to appear in court before a State Supreme Court judge ordered them to re turn their adopted child, Lenore to her natural mother. Meanwhile the adoption agency in the proceedings ques tioned Whether the law was not placing “too high a premium on the primacy of the mother.” The court reserved decison. The child was ordered re turned to her natural mother, Miss Olga Scarpetta, after the lower court found that the adoption agency, the Spence Chapin Adoption Service, had acted “with undue haste” in placing the baby with the De Martinos. The lower‐court rul ing was upheld by the Appellate Division. Today Jacob D. Fuchsberg lawyer for the De Martinos, was given permission to address the state's highest court during an appeal that had been granted to the adoption service. Citing the need to consider both the best interests of the child and the rights of the nat ual mother, Mr. Fuchsberg said the lower court had not pursued the interests of the child ade quately because it had failed to call the adoptive parents to the initial hearing. The monimum that the state's highest court Should grant, the lawyer said, is a “new trial in which ques tions of fact could be delved into.” Joseph Zalk, attorney for Miss Scarpetta, told the court that his client was aware of the “emotional content” of the case, which has resulted in a number of bills being introduced in the State Legislature affecting the time in which a natural mother can reclaim her child. Noting that the mother had indicated she wanted her baby returned three weeks after it was placed with the agency. Mr. Zalk said that if the agency “had gone to the adoptive par ents immediately and said the mother wants her child back,” the emotional problem might have been avoided. Questioned by Chief Judge Stanley Fuld about the De Mar tinos' protest that they had not been called to the hearing, Mr. Zalk said that previous court decisions had held that the adoptive parents had no stand ing in court. Roy L. Reardon, attorney for Spence‐Chapin sought to dis tingush between Miss Scarpetta and “a teen‐aged unwed moth er” surrendering her child un der financial and emotional stress. He described Miss Scarpetta, who is a native of Colombia, as an “extremely well‐educated lady.” He said she had gone to New York City for the specific purpose of having her baby born in obscurity and then to place it for adoption. Noting that Miss Scarpetta was 31 years old at the time, he said “she was not under the same duress as a teen‐aged, un wed mother.” Because of this, Mr. Reardon said, “society should say, ‘Let's look at that mother differently; she wavered. “Why pluck that child from its adoptive parents?’”

574-> CITY NOTES JUMP IN WELFARE ROLLS AS JOBS DECLINE
A new acceleration in New York City's expanding relief rolls was made known yesterterday, reflecting in part a quadrupled loss of jobs by parents forced on to welfare. The over‐all March rise of 13,960 relief recipients announced by the city's Department of Social Services was just about double February's increase of 7,011. The rise in January had been 9,049, down from December's 17,988. There were 439 families with 2,000 parents and children added to the aid to dependent children‐unemployed parent rolls during March, compared with only 93 such families, with 517 members, added in February. A Large Percentage Rise Such unemployed‐parent families represented 14.3 per cent of the March increase in relief recipients, far above the category's proportion of only 4 per cent in the case load. The new rise brought the number of people on relief here to 1,195,603. For the first nine months of the city's budget year started last July 1, this made an average monthly increase of 13,068, compared with an original estimate a year ago of 5,500. The trend will make it necessary for the city to borrow on budget notes to meet welfare costs for the rest of the current fiscal year. For the new city budget starting July 1, now the center of city and state wrangling, Mayor Lindsay has estimated an average welfare increase of 13,000 people a month. This would mean that the welfare rolls would grow to 1.4‐million people by June 30, 1972. The Mayor's forecast was given in the budget he proposed May 1. The forecast was based on the assumption that the state legislature would rescind its 10 per cent cut in welfare grant levels for families with aid to dependent children and for home relief recipients. Without such a restoration—so far strongly, opposed by Republican majority, leaders in the Legislature—fewer persons would be eligible for welfare. 90,000 City Jobs Held in Peril On the other hand, Mayor Lindsay has also forecast that as many as 90,000 city jobs might be eliminated unless the Legislature restore all local aid so far slashed and unless he received all the taxing powers lie had asked. Such a massive elimination of city jobs “could have 50,000 to 75,000 additional welfare cases generated by layoffs in the city,” according to Jule M. Sugarman, the city's Human Resources Administrator. The city originally appropriated $1.7‐billion for the Department of Social Services in the current budget year; the actual spending will be about $1.9billion. For the coming budget year, Mayor Lindsay's proposal would cost $2,177,300,000, including $1,327,800,000 in welfare grants and $442‐million in Medicaid. Without state restorations, the cost of grants would drop about $95‐million and the cost of Medicaid about $90‐million. The Legislature had ordered basic welfare grants—exclusive of rent and heat payments—for a family of four here cut from $231 a month to $208, and Medicaid eligibility reduced from annual incomes of $5,000 for a four‐person family to $4,500. The March totals for welfare recipients hero were as follows:

575-> CONSULTANT BILL HEED UP IN ALBANY
ALBANY, April 22—The Sen ate today unexpectedly can celed its approval of a bill limiting consultant contracts so it could take up a measure that would place greater con sultant strictures on Mayor Lindsay. The reversal, which stunned city aides who had worked hard for a compromise in the form of the bill passed yes terday, was voted at the re quest of Senator John J. Mar chi, Republican‐Conservative of Staten Island, with the support of City Controller Abraham D. Beame. Both men have been critical of the Mayor's handling of his power to award independent consulting contracts, which last year totaled in excess of $70 million. The bill approved yester day, which was acceptable to Mr. Lindsay, would have re quired executives of all cities in the state to advertise and hold hearings on contracts of $20,000 and over. Mr. Marchi personaily called Senate Ma jority Leader Earl W. Brydges this morning to request that yesterday's unanimous vote of approval be reconsidered. “Let's put both bills under the jeweler's eye,” the Senator, who ran against Mr. Lindsay in the 1969 mayoral election, said in an interview. He said the bill's coming to a vote had eluded his attention yesterday. Mr. Marchi's measure would require hearings and approval by the city's Board of Estimate —whose members have also been critical of the Mayor on consultant contracts of $10, 000 and more sought by the Mayor. This bill is limited to New York City, in contrast to the recalled, statewide measure, which was sponsored by John J. Santucci, Democrat of Queens. Both Mr. Santucci and Rich ard A. Brown, the city's legisla tive representative, were critical of the Marchi bill in interviews. “It would tie the Mayor up in a lot of red tape, greatly im pede the progress of capital [construction] projects and leave these decisions with local officials more open to various pressures,” Mr. Santucci said. Whatever the outcome of the Marchi bill, Mr. Santucci added, the statewide bill was needed since scores of millions of dol lars in consulting contracts are awarded outside the city. Both bills probably will be considered together next week, Mr. Marchi said. The Staten Island legislator, who is chair man of the Senate Committee on New York City Affairs, noted that it is not unusual for a legislator to ask for re consideration of a passed bill. In this case, however, poli ticians on both sides of the aisle appreciated, some with smiles and twinkling eyes, that the stage was being set for a more extensive look at the con sultant issue. “I don't like to fetter the chief executive,” Mr. Marchi explained. “The consultant pro cess can be a good idea, but frankly the situation has gotten out of hand.” In the Assembly, the Marchi bill is sponsored by Leonard Price Stavisky, Democrat‐Lib eral of Queens, who endorsed Mayor Lindsay in 1969 and was, in turn, praised as a statesman. Sources explained that Mr. Stavisky received the measure as ranking minority leader of the Assembly's New York City Committee after it was handed on by Minority Leader Stanley Steingut, who received it from Mr. Beanie.

576-> Apollo 15 Is Ready for Lift‐Off Tomorrow
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla., July 24 — The countdown for Apollo 15 moved into its final and most critical hours tonight as preparations continued to run smoothly for a scheduled launching Monday of the na tion's fourth and most ambi tious moon‐landing mission. Lift‐off of the 6.5 million‐ pound spaceship is set for 9:34 A.M., Eastern daylight time. The objective of the $445‐mil lion flight is a landing in the mountains of the moon for three days of extensive explora tion of craters, canyons and crustal rock. The objectives of this moon landing are far more ambitious than those of previous ones. Some of them are a study of how rilles (the meandering, canyon‐like features of the lunar surface) were formed, re trieval of samples of a dense material, or “mascon,” that exerts a slightly elevated grav itational pull on spacecraft, and the drilling of three holes in the surface to measure the flow of heat outward from the lunar interior. After a review of status re ports on the Saturn 5 rocket, the spacecraft and the world wide tracking network, Rocco A. Petrone, the Apollo director, gave the go‐ahead signal for the launching crews to begin the fueling, battery installation and other final countdown steps. Donald K. Slayton, director of flight crew operations, re ported that the astronauts— Col. David R. Scott, Lieut. Col. James B. Irwin and Maj. Alfred M. Worden of the Air Force— were “fit, relaxed and ready to go.” At launching complex 39, James Harrington, the Apollo 15 test supervisor, said, “Every thing is going real smooth. Even the weather outlook is good.” Hundreds of thousands of visitors were gathering in the nearby communities and along the beaches, arriving by char tered planes, yachts, buses, cars and campers. The local police were bracing for a possible one million spectators, the largest crowd here since the first moon‐ landing launching two years ago. It was quite a contrast, the old‐timers remarked, with the time 21 years ago today—July 24, 1950—when the first rocket was fired from what was then called Cape Canaveral. The rocket was a captured German V‐2 with a WAC Corporal sec ond stage attached. A painter's scaffold served as the support tower. A one‐foot‐thick slab of concrete was the pad. Now, some 1,800 launchings later, American astronauts are Apollo Is Ready to Go Tomorrow planning man's seventh flight to the vicinity of the moon, about 239,000 miles away. If all goes well, Colonel Scott and Colonel Irwin will be the sev enth and eighth human beings to walk on the moon's desolate but scientifically intriguing sur face. Their landing craft, Falcon, is scheduled to take them down over the moon's towering 12, 000‐foot‐high Apennine Moun tains to a smooth site near the rim of a 1,200‐foot‐deep can yon, Hadley Rille. The landing area is situated 465 miles north of the lunar equator on the southeastern edge of the Sea of Rains. During their 67‐hour visit, twice as long as any previous crew has stayed, Colonel Scott and Colonel Irwin plan to make three excursions outside their landing craft for, a total of about 20 hours of exploration. For most of their excursions, they expect to get about on a four‐wheel, battery‐driven rov ing vehicle, Rover 1. At each stop, to collect rocks or set up scientific instruments or drill into the surface, the Rover's television camera is expected to transmit to earth close‐up pictures of the astronauts' every move. While Colonel Scott and Colonel Irwin are on the sur face, Major Worden will be piloting the command ship, En deavor, in lunar orbit. Unlike previous command module pilots, who had little to do but maintain the ship, Major Worden expects to be busy operating a number of remote‐ sensing devices to investigate the moon's surface chemistry and to take detailed photo graphs for mapping purposes. Apollo 15 will also deploy a 78.5‐pound scientific satellite that is to radio data‐for at least a year on gravitational, mag netic and electrical fields of the moon. The surface explorers plan to leave behind a nuclear‐powered set of instruments to monitor moonquakes, impacts of charged particles on the moon and other lunar phenomena. Apollo 15 is scheduled to reach an orbit of the moon at 4:07 P.M. next Thursday. Col onel Scott and Colonel Irwin would land on the moon at 6:15 P.M. the next day. On Saturday morning, the two men are to begin the first of their three excursions out on the lunar surface. Their first duties, after deploying an American flag, are to unpack the Rover. Then they are to drive off to inspect the canyon and the base of the Apennine Mountains. The second and third excur sions are scheduled to take place on Sunday and Monday. Their Sunday journey should take them about five miles away from the landing craft to another part of the moun tains. On their Monday trip the as tronauts plan a more detailed inspection of Hadley Rille as well as a look at some small craters that may have been formed by volcanoes. The slope to the floor of Hadley Rille is too steep for the Rover, but rocks along the rim may help determine how the gorge was formed. During their time on the moon the astronauts expect to drive over an area about the size of Manhattan and to collect 250 pounds of rocks and soil, more than the total returned by the three previous Apollo moon exploring teams. On Monday afternoon, the two astronauts are scheduled to lift off the moon and re turned to the command ship. The Rover's television camera should be able to televise the lift‐off live to earth. After two additional days in lunar orbit. Apollo 15 should begin its homeward voyage at 5:18 P.M. Wednesday, Aug. 4. The next morning, Major Wor den plans to open the command ship hatch and step into space. He is to retrieve film packs from the lunar‐mapping cameras in the rear compartment of the spaceship. On Aug. 7, Apollo is sched uled to splash down at 4:46 P.M., Eastern daylight time, in the Pacific Ocean north of Hawaii. As planned, Apollo 15 will be followed by only two more Moon landings, Apollo 16 next March and, Apollo 17 in Decem ber, 1972. With such a busy 12 days ahead of them, the three astro nauts were relaxing this week‐ end, having completed their two years of training. Colonel Irwin played a set of tennis with one of the backup astro nauts. All three men flew T‐38 jet planes this afternoon while launching pad technicians were pumping liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen into Apollo 15 to run its electricity‐generating fuel cells. The first stage of the Saturn 5 rocket is already loaded with its kerosene‐type fuel, and pro pellants for the other two stages will be pumped aboard early Monday.

577-> Senator Byrd Backs Admiral, His Uncle, On '26 Polar Flight
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 (AP) —Beret Balchen, the Norwegian‐born pilot of the first plane to fly over the South Pole, in 1929, says that Adm. Richard E. Byrd was false in his claim of being the first to fly over the North Pole, in 1926. Admiral Byrd's nephew, Senator Harry F. Byrd Jr., Indepeendent of Virginia, defended the memory of his famed relative today. Mr. Balchen, who saw Admiral Byrd and his pilot, Floyd Bennett, take off from Spitsbergen on May 9, 1026, and witnessed their return 15½ hours later with an account of having circled the North Pole, told a reporter that the plane they flew was incapable of flying to the pole and returning in the time span of their flight. “It was an out‐and‐out lie,” Mr. Balchen said of the flight. “Floyd admitted this to me in confidence later,” he con. tinued. “I couldn't speak up then, but now, after all these years, the record ought to be set straight.” Mr. Balchen was the pilot who flew Admiral Byrd over the South Pole In 1929, three years after the North Pole flight. Now 72 years old and a re tired Air Force colonel, Mr. Balchen recently underwent surgery at a hospital at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. He lives in Chappaqua, N. Y. In a brief statement, Senator Byrd said: “It is significant that the man Balchen quotes, Floyd Bennett, has been dead for 43 years, and that the man Balchen libels, Admiral Byrd, has been dead for 14 years. “I doubt that anything Mr. Balchen says will detract from Admiral Byrd's great record, a record recognized by President Herbert Hoover, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the National Geographic Society.”

578-> Surge by Colonels Beats Nets,122‐104; Issel Collects 39
LOUISVILLE, Ky., March 16 (AP)—The Kentucky Colonels capitalized on a third‐quarter rally to down the New York Nets 122‐104, tonight in the second game of an American Basketball Association double‐ header. Indiana used a similar pat tern to trim Pittsburgh, 130‐119, in the opener, with Freddie Lewis and Roger Brown in the chief roles. The double‐header was for the benefit of the late A.B.A. referee, Andy Hershock. Dan Issel scored 39 points and pulled down 21 rebounds to lead Kentucky, which pulled ahead by 15 after three quarters. Rick Barry scored 29 to top the Nets, but got only 10 in the last half.

579-> PRICES OF BONDS CONTINUE CLIMB
The credit markets gained more strength yesterday as bond prices continued to climb and interest rates kept moving downward, keeping intact the move that began one week earlier. The Treasury Department, meanwhile, announced plans to raise $5‐billion in cash by sell ing bills prior to the period of heavy corporate‐tax payments in the second half of April. Corporate underwriting activ ity was heavy yesterday even though the market faced no ma jor long‐term financing that could be construed as a pace setting issue. The $50‐million Seaboard Coast Line Railroad issue was put off a week, while the $100‐million North Ameri can Rockwell Corporation offer ing, once postponed, was put back on the schedule and will be offered today. In the tax‐exempt securities market, short‐term rates con tinued to decline, and some long‐term issues failed to sell quickly as underwriters pushed rates lower. Dealers explained the mar ket's action as the result of several factors: The Federal Reserve's report that industrial production dropped in Febru ary; anticipation of a discount rate reduction; the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company's prime rate cut; something of a lull in the huge March sched ule of corporate bond sales; and the large volume of money‐seeking investment. The advance in bond prices over the past week has been dramatic. The Southwestern Bell Telephone Company 6⅞ per cent 40‐year debentures, for example, have recouped almost half their steep Febru ary decline. The debentures, priced orig inally on Jan. 26 at 101.026 to yield 6.80 per cent, traded as low as 91¼ early last week. Yesterday they were back above 95. The Duke Power Company 7½ per cent bonds offered last Thursday at a yield of 7.42 per cent, an issue that dragged its heels at first, picked up speed yesterday. By late afternoon, the $100‐million offering was “substantially in excess of 75 per cent sold,” according to Merrill Lynch, the leading un derwriter. Against this backdrop of ris ing bond prices, several big corporate issues were tenta tively priced for sale today. North American Rockwell's $100‐million financing, to be offered by a Kuhn Loeb group, is expected to consist of $50‐ million of 8.30 per cent deben tures due March 1, 1996, and $50‐million of 7.30 per cent notes maturing March 1, 1977. Both are priced at 100 per cent of their face value. They are rated Baa by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's. The Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America's $80‐mil lion financing scheduled today through a Dillon Read‐Halsey Stuart group is expected to in clude $40‐million of 7.70 per cent bonds due 1991 and $40‐ million of 6.75 per cent deben tures due 1977, both priced at 100. The bonds are rated Aa and the debentures, A. A syndicate co‐managed by Kuhn Loeb and Lazard Freres plans to sell $35‐million of Baa‐rated Puerto Rico Tele phone Company 8.70 per cent debentures due 1976 at a price of 100. The company is an in direct subsidiary of ITT. An underwriting network led by First Boston plans to sell $30‐million of Government guaranteed 20‐year debentures of Park Forest South Develop ment, the third financing for a new community under new Fed eral programs. The debentures are expected to be sold with a 7 per cent interest rate and a price of 100. They are noncallable for 10 years. In a real estate investment‐ trust offering, the Northwest ern Mutual Life Mortgage & Realty investors expect to sell $50‐million of 6 per cent 20‐ year debentures today along with 2.5 million shares of beneficial interest through a Morgan Stanley group. The debentures will be convertible into the shares at a 5 per cent premium. Several corporate fixed‐in come issues were marketed yesterday. In the largest, the $50‐mil lion of Detroit Edison Com pany 7.68 per cent preferred stock priced late Monday was sold by a Morgan Stanley‐Blyth‐ Lehman Brothers group at a price of $100 a share. The Utah Power & Light Company awarded $35‐million of A‐rated bonds maturing in 1976 to a group co‐managed by Salomon Brothers, Eastman Dillonand Smith Barney. The syndicate put a 6¼ per cent interest rate on the securities and priced them at 100. The Southern Pacific awarded $9.99‐million of Aa‐rated equip ment trust certificates to a Salomon Brothers group that priced them to yield from 4.50 per cent on those maturing in 1972 up to 7.30 per cent in 1986 and 1996. This yield scale was note worthy because its 280‐basis‐ point spread between the short est and the longest maturities was the widest on record. At the end of 1969, by comparison, Aa‐rated rail certificates were offered all at the same yield, regardless of maturity. The Treasury's $5‐million bill financing announced yesterday will consist of several parts. The regular weekly sales of six‐month bills, now amounting to $1.4‐billion, will be increased by $200‐million for four weeks, starting March 22 and ending April 12. An additional $2‐billion of April tax‐anticipation bills will be auctioned on March 24 for payment March 30. These bills, which are in addition to $2,3‐ billion of tax anticipation bills already outstanding, will ma ture April 22 but they may be used to pay Federal income taxes coming due April 15. In addition, a “strip” of Treasury bills totaling $2.2 billion will be auctioned March 31 with payment April 6. Sub scribers must submit tenders for equal amounts of 11 Treas ury‐bill issues being reopened in the strip offering. These bills mature July 8 through Sept. 6, the Treasury said. In the tax‐exempt securities market, the Department of Housing and Urban Develop ment reported the sale of $657, 449,000 of notes to finance housing projects at an average interest rate of 2.135 per cent, down from 2.2514 per cent in an urban renewal project note sale last week. Groups consisting of First National City Bank, Continen tal Illinois National Bank, First Boston and Mellon National Bank purchased $479.27‐mil lion. The Newark, N. J., school bond issue that gained addi tional state backing and was upgraded in rating to Aa from Baa on Mondy was awarded yesterday to a syndicate co managed by UMIC, Inc.; Stephens, Inc.; Tecott, Jackson, Wilson & White; and Hibbard, O'Connor & Weeks. The syndicate purchased $18,754,000 of Newark bonds, priced them to yield from 2.25 per cent in 1972 to 5.50 per cent in 1991 and reported all but $1.86‐million sold by late afternoon. The additional state backing cut the city's interest cost sharply. The rate yesterday was roughly 5.11 per cent, or 17 basis points below the Bond Buyer index. A year ago, New ark sold $20‐million of 7.40 per cent bonds, a rate 145 basis points above the Bond Buyer index then. Under a state measure enact ed Monday, New Jersey will pay its school commitment for Newark directly to the bond paying agent. Even so, the issue failed to sell as a normal Aa‐rated issue yesterday. Its 5.11 interest cost, for example, was higher than the 4.66 per cent rate incurred by Baltimore in selling $35, 225,000 of bonds rated A, or one notch lower. The Baltimore bonds were sold to a group headed by Hal sey Stuart that priced them to yield from 2.25 per cent in 1971 up to 5 per cent in 1991. The bonds sold relatively slowly, however, and $28.15‐million re mained in the underwriters' hands at the end of the day.

581-> Russian Blames U.S. War By THOMAS J. HAMILTON
GENEVA, Sept. 6—A Soviet delegate told a United Nations group today that the dollar had weakened because the “aggressive war in Indochina” had created balance‐of‐payments difficulties for the United States. S. A. Shevchenko, Soviet representative on the board of UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development), charged also that the United States was attempting to solve its inflation problems at the expense of other countries. The Soviet representatives said that UNCTAD, which was established to champion the claims of the developing countries for help from the industrialized countries, should play a greater role in helping to solve international monetary problems. Until now, he said, decisions have been taken by a restricted number of “wealthy Western nations.” Mr. Shevchenko expressed agreement with a recent statement by Manuel PerezGuerrero of Venezuela, director general of UNCTAD, on the need for a new international monetary system. Although Mr. Shevchenko did not comment on President Nixon's program for strengthening the dollar, it was bitterly attacked by Maurice Viaud of France. The French delegate said that if the situation was not quickly remedied it might lead to “an economic and financial Balkanization of the world.” Under a resolution introduced today by Hernan Santa Cruz of Chile, on behalf of the Latin‐American members of the “group of 77” developing countries, the UNCTAD board would ask the United States to waive the 10 per cent surcharge on imports originating in the developing countries. Another resolution would authorize the UNCTAD secretariat to join the International Monetary Fund in studying the impact of the international monetary situation on the developing countries. It would request Dr. Perez‐Guerrero to engage in consultations on a reformed monetary system to promote the condition of the developing countries. Edgar Jones, Geneva representative of the International Monetary Fund, said the fund would remain in close consultation with the United States and other members with a view to the prompt achievement of a viable structure of exchange rates on the basis of parities established and maintained in accordance with the Fund's articles of agreement. Mr. Jones made another appearance today at a closed meeting of the GATT committee which is to report to the membership on the Nixon program by Sept. 20. Reliable sources said he had submitted the Fund's appraisal of the monetary crisis and the Nixon program but that it would remain confidential for the time being.

582-> Ogilvy Posts 3d Sail Victory Of Weekend in Y.R.A. Regatta
LARCHMONT, N. Y., Sept. 6 —C. Stanley Ogilvy won his third Etchells‐22 Class race of the weekend with Flame on Long Island Sound today. He triumphed in the season's 34th Yacht.

583-> Latin America Set To Test Trade Pact
BUENOS AIRES, Sept. 6 —The creaking 10‐year‐old Alliance for Progress will have to weather yet another storm on Friday when the United States will face a united front of aggrieved Latin‐American nations at the annual meeting of the Inter‐American Economic and Social Council in Panama. At the meeting, Latin‐American nations are expected to demand the immediate removal of the 10 per cent surcharge on all imports from the developing nations, request a firm commitment to introduce preferential tariffs for the developing countries next Jan. 1 and call for the immediate restoration of the 10 per cent cut in foreign aid ordered by President Nixon. These proposals emerged from the emergency meeting of the Economic Coordinating Commission for Latin America, attended by delegations from 19 Latin‐American and Caribbean countries, which finally wound up last night, 24 hours behind schedule. The concensus of the meeting was set out in a strongly worded document called a “Latin American Manifesto.” It was transmitted to President Nixon before it was made public at the closing session last night. Apart from trade and aid demands to the United States, the manifesto (in the words of the Argentine Treasury Minister, Juan Alberto Quilici, whose speech closed the meeting) expressed the Latin‐American nations' “wish to be protagonists and not mere spectators of all world decisions in regard to monetary policy.” The extra day was largely spent in wrangling over the final wording of the manifesto. In the end, a more, conciliatory approach to the United States won the day. Argentina, which, (with 60 per cent of her exports to the United States affected by the 10 per cent surcharge) is the country hardest hit by the dollar protection measures, originally spoke of reprisal threats. But the general view among delegates yesterday was that President Nixon would indeed lift the tariff for developing nations. So, as one delegate put it, “The manifesto was drafted so as to make it easier to establish a dialogue and thus find ways to solve the problems caused by President Nixon's measures.” The manifesto pointed out that the United States had a “traditionally favorable” balance of payments with LatinAmerica countries, that the import tax “is harmful and unjust [because] it calls upon LatinAmerican and other developing nations to bear the weight of measures directed at problems they have not caused.” A report prepared for Friday's meeting in Panama discloses that in 1970 the United States had a favorable trade balance with Latin America amounting to $790‐million. The cut in foreign aid “will have no significant effect in balancing the payments problem while aggravating the difficult situation of many countries in Latin America and other developing areas,” the manifesto said. A reduction in aid funds could also lead to the concellation of economic programs which relied to some extent on external financing, the document asserted. In regard to monetary policy, the Latin‐American nations decided to present a common front, demanding a bigger say in International Monetary Fund and World Bank affairs at the forthcoming meeting of the governors of Latin‐American and Philippine central banks to be held in Bogotá.

585-> Chinese Group Arrives;
UNITED NATIONS; N. Y., Nov. 8—A Six‐man advance party for the Chinese delega tion to the United Nations ar rived today at Kennedy Airport aboard an Mr France Hoeing 707 jet airliner. The six men were the first Chinese Communist officials to set foot on American soil since 1950 when a delegation from Peking attended a United Nations debate on the Korean war. The Chinese who arrived today from Paris will concern themselves primarily with arrangements for security, housing and office space for the regular 10‐man Chinese delegation to the United Nations, which is expected to arrive here on Wednesday or Thursday, also flying from Paris. The Chinese, word white shirts, blue‐gray Mao;süits and black overcoats when they. stepped off their plane at 12:19 P.M. after an eight‐hour flight in the economy class section. Air France officials identified them as Kao Liang, Chia Tzucheng, Tien Jung‐tsien, Lin Chia‐sen, Hsu Hsin‐li and Lieu Chen‐piao. Upon arrival, they were met by members of the Albanian and Rumanian missions to the United Nations—two of the delegations that had worked hardest for the admission of the mainland Chinese—as well as by United Nations officials. The Chinese were quickly passed through customs procedures after showing their red diplomatic passports. They were then, whisked away by a double phalanx of policemen into two rented cars parked outside the international arrivals terminal and were driven to the Roosevelt Hotel at 45th Street and Madison Avenue. At the hotel, the Chinese were accommodated in three unconnected rooms on the 14th floor. The rooms, with daily rates of $32 to $38; have twin beds, and will be supplied with black‐andwhite television sets. Officials at the hotel, which also serves as headquarters for the New York County Reptiblican Committee, would not disclose who had made the reservations for the Chinese or how long they were expected to stay. Security at the hotel did not appear to be heavy. After checking into their rooms, the Chinese delegation descended to the lobby, at 2:30 P.M. and in a brief interview, Mr. Rao, speaking in English, explained their mission. “We are just an advance group of the delegation of the Chinese People's Republic to the 26th session of the General Assembly,” he said. “We are here just to make administrative preparations for the arrival of our delegation.” Then, excusing himself, saying, “Please, we have just arrived—we will talk to you later,” he walked toward the side exit of the hotel accompanied by the five other Chinese officials. They stepped into the same red Mercury and green Plymouth in which they had ridden from the airport and drove off to visit the Albanian mission, 250 East 87th Street, and the Rumanian mission, 60 East Q93d Street. A Rumanian official who accompanied them said the Chinese were paying “goodwill visits” to the missions. After returning from the Albanian mission shortly after P.M., the Chinese retired to their rooms in the Roosevelt. When asked for an interview, one Chinese who came to the dopy said: “We haven't got time now. We have many things to do.” A Rumanian official said that his mission had made the reservations for the Chinese at the Roosevelt Hotel, and that, the delegation scheduled to arrive late in the week was also expected to stay temporarily at the Roosevet. He said it was likely that the entire 14th flor would be reserved for the delegation. Later, four members of the Chinese party toured the building with a hotel executive, inquiring about the price, size and availability of rooms. They visited the coffee shop and, strolled about the scarletcarpeted lobby, while other guests stared. Strong security precautions were in effect at the airport, with some 50 uniformed policemen and an undisclosed number of plainclothes men and members of the secret service stationed around the international arrivals building. But aside from a small army of reporters and photographers, there were few onlookers when the Chinese stepped out of the baggage claims area. One group on hand, however, consisted of about 30 third‐graders from P.S. 175 in Brook. lyn, who had been taken on a, sightseeing tour of the airport by their teacher. Asked what he thought of the Chinese delegation's mission, one boy said, “They're here to see how good America is.” A girl remarked: “They will go to Chinatown,” but another third‐grade boy asserted: “They are hereto take over.” Among the officials on hand to greet the Chinese at the airport were Ion Dame, second secretary at the Rumanian mission; Petraq Pjani, counselor of the Albanian mission; Itozmu Moja, second secretary of the Albanian mission; Mohammed Ould Sidi Aly, Mauritanian Am bassador to Peking; Byron Castrounis, a protocol liaison officer for the United. Nations Secretariat, and Nicholas Gounaropoulos of the travel section of the Secretariat. Three members of the United States mission to the United Nations were also at the airport in case the Chinese encountered any difficulty with customs officials, but they did not meet the delegation. Air France officials here said they knew of no security agents who had been on board the plane on the flight from Paris, but the passenger list was given a careful scrutiny by security men at Orly Airport before the plane took off into cloudy skies. During the flight, according to other persons aboard the plane, the members of the party chatted among themselves and read Chinese newspapers along with The International Herald Tribune, The Daily Mail of London and the Nov. 8 issue of Time magazine. A copy of Time caught their attention because its cover bore a portrait of the Chinese Premier, Chou En‐lai. When they asked, for earphones to listen to recorded music, one member took a $100 bill out of his wallet to pay the $2.50 fee. But change was lacking, and the charge was waived. John Burton, one of the chauffeurs, who drove the Chinese from the airport to the hotel, said they had been silent during most of the trip. Mr. Burton said that two ears belonged to Avon Rent‐aCar, and that he had been assigned to drive by Chauffeurs Admiral, Inc. “One of them asked me if the car was a taxi,” said Mr. Burten, a tall, bespectacled, 33‐year‐old housepainter who chauffeurs on a part‐time basis. “I told him it wasn't and then I pointed out a yellow cab to let him know what they Iook like.” “I get $300 a week as a painter when I'm working full time,” said Mr. Burton, waiting for his passengers in front of the Albanian mission. “Here I am getting $2.50 an hour chauffeuring people around. Who are these guys, anyway, Russian?” Informed that they were Chinese, and from Peking, he said, “Well a painter isn't supposed to know about the world.” The leader of the Chinese group is Mr. Kao, a tall, husky man whb appears to be in his forties. He has been a foreign correspondent for Hsinhua, the official Chinese press agency, and Jenmin Jih Pao, the Chinese Communist party newspaper. In August, 1960, Mr. Kao was expelled from India for unknown reasons. He reported on the Geneva Conference on Laos in 1961 and filed dispatches from East Africa in the early nineteen‐sixties. Nothing was known about the backgrounds of the other Chinese officials in the entourage.

587-> Wood, Field and Stream: On the Pier
Although angling for the more exotic species off North Carolina's coast—white and blue marlin and sailfish—attracts more national attention, most fisher. man who Journey to that state's seashore spend their time on pier or beach. To some, pier fishing is not simply an inexpensive way to getting a line in the water the average daily rate is $1.50) but an art worthy of an experienced angler's attention. From spring through fall most of the 30‐odd piers that jut out into the Atlantic along the coast operate on an around‐the‐clock basis, ideal for the man who has only a few hours to devote to angling. Most of the piers are long, reaching out beyond the breakers, and all have bait for sale, tackle for rent and snack bars. At the proper time of year, one can expect to catch anything from two species of sea trout to cobia, tarpon, king mackerel, bluefish, flounder and pupy drum. Those who bring their own tackle to the piers would do well to use spinning gear in the 20‐pound class and it is a good idea to carry lures as well as bottom fishing rigs, for there are times when such spediets as bluefish and king mackerel may be taken by casting. • For anglers on a strict budget there are many private camp sites, as well as those operated by the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. This November and December the Outer Banks will probably have more surf fishermen on hand than ever before, In November of last year an unusually heavy run of giant bluefish hit north of Nags Head. Striped bass were in the surf also, but no one expected to catch them. For many years, it had been known that stripers cruise along the outer banks in winter but, with tare exceptions, they were never caught on rod and reel. Then on Nov. 20, 1970, some 30 stripers ranging from 20 to 30 pounds were caught in three hours on metal jigs off Avon, and on Dec. 7 nearly 100 of these fish up to 45 pounds were beached, Successful fishing for stripers from the beach continued until early January. No one knows, of course, whether it wilt happen again this year but many surf fishermen all along the Atlantic Coast are watching and waiting. • The newly published Salt Water Sport Fishing and Boating In North Caroline is an excellent guide for those who have never fished in the state before, It may be obtained by writing the Alexandria Drafting Company, 417 East Clifford Avenue, Alexandria, Va. 22305.

588-> 20 Held in Albuquerque As Guard Curbs Rioters
ALBUQUERQUE N. M., June 14—National Guard units patrolled the streets of this city tonight to curb marauding bands of hippies Negroes and Mexican‐Americans who had created serious disorders through the day. More than 200 persons mostly youths, were arrested during a continuation of violence that began last night There were no comprehensive figures immediately available on the day's injured, but at least a dozen persons were hurt Fire Chief Ray Kuhn estimated property damage from arson rock throwing and looting at $2‐million. The guardsmen used tear gas to clear the streets Most of the arrests were for violation of a 7 P.M. to 6 A.M. curfew that prohibited gatherings of more than three persons. There was sporadic sniper fire during the day. Held in Gymnasium The people arrested were held in the University of New Mexico gymnasium. Prisoners at the city‐county jail had rioted early setting fire to part of the facility. The most serious incident occurred at a public school administration complex that had been damaged by fire in last night's rioting. About 50 youths threw gasoline bombs over hastifly massed National Guardsmen at an unburned building. The youths were dispersed with tear gas and about 25 were arrested by the police. As the group was broken up about six shots came from the crowd. No one appeared to be hit. The guardsmen and the police were also pelted with rocks. Gov. Bruce King had ordered 1,300 guardsmen moved into the city this morning. The guardmen who were under the command of Maj. Gen. James Jolly, the state adjutant general, had been in summer camp at Fort Bliss in El Paso Tex., about 300 miles away. The guardsmen had been kept on alert but had not been actively used in riot control until the school confrontation. Elsewhere in the city, particularly along Route 66 there were incidents of rock‐throwing and car‐smashing State and city policemen stopped cars and arrested the unruly Many were also arrested for violating the 7‐P.M‐to‐6‐A.M‐curfew imposed by city officials. Armed Shopowners In some stores along Route 66, which is heavily traveled by tourists shopowners stayed into the night armed with shotguns to prevent looting. The violence erupted last night when a rock concert in Roosevelt Park was canceled and five youths were arrested for drinking in public. The arrests led to rock‐throwing and bottle‐throwing and the overturning of two police cars. Soon there were large unruly groups in the streets one marched downtown to City Hall and attempted to set fire to the building. There were a number of fires including a $1million blaze at the American Furniture Company. Before the night ended 150 youths had been arrested. Most were subsequently released in their own recognizance. In all 33 people were hurt including four policemen. Thirteen remained in city hospitals today five of them in critical condition. It was incorrectly reported by United Press International early today that an unidentified man had been shot to death by a security guard when he tried to break into a liquor store during the roiting last night. This afternoon, the Black Berets, a black‐Chicano coalition that has often complained about police brutality received permission to hold a rally in Roosevelt Park. The crowd heard David Norvell the State Attorney General, condemn the previous night's violence but promise an investigation of the police brutality charges. After the rally, about 300 hippies, joined by about 100 Chicanos and a few dozen blacks went on a window‐smashing spree along Route 66. At one point they burned an American flag that they had torn from a house. The unruly crowd eluded a convoy of 31 state police vehicles by darting across the campus of the University of New Mexico. Hundreds of students watched but did not participate. After the detour through the campus about 50 of the group continued on to the school administration building and the confrontation with the National Guard. The tear gas used to disperse them spread a pall over 40 residential blocks. Throughout the day, there were large crowds of students and homeowners watching the rioting. On a number of occasions, rioters threw rocks at the police and then melted into the crowds.

591-> Frazier Enters Hospital With High Blood Pressure
Joe Frazier was admitted to St. Luke's Hospital in Philadelphia yesterday for what his physician described as “high blood pressure” related to the world heavy weight champion's “commit ments” following his strenu ous victory over Muhammad Ali last week at Madison Square Garden. Frazier is expected to re main in the hospital several days “for blood studies,” ac cording to Dr. James Giuffre, the hospital's chief of staff. “I saw Joe yesterday when he came to visit our drugabuse clinic, and he's very in terested in helping those pa tients,” Giuffre said by tele phone. “When he returned to day to show fight films, he said he felt tired. I checked his blood pressure and it was 160 over 90. It should be 120 over 90.” Giuffre denied reports that Frazier had suffered a de tached retina of the left eye during the 15‐round fight March 8. “He has an inflammation of the eye,” the doctor said. “But he had no complaints about his vision. I believe the high blood pressure is a result of all his commitments, not from the fight itself. The blood studies will be made to make certain that there's nothing organically wrong with him.” The champion's only public appearance since the fight was a brief stay that night at a hotel victory party. For a boxer, a detached retina, even if surgically re paired, would end his career. Boxing's most recent victim of such an injury was Leotis Martin, a Philadelphia heavy weight, who has not com peted since incurring it in a 1969 fight with the late Sonny Liston, whom he knocked out. Frazier was unavailable for comment, as he has been for a week. But contradic tions clouded his medical status, contradictions that have led to recurring reports of an imminent retirement. According to his wife, Flor ence, speaking from their home in Whitemarsh, Pa., he stayed at St. Luke's for sev eral days, beginning last Thursday, for treatment of the flu, but spent the nights in a Philadelphia motel rather than expose their five chil dren to the illness. A spokesman for Clover lay, Inc., the Philadelphia group that has sponsored Frazier's career, said the champion checked into the hospital Thursday and re mained through Sunday. Based upon this fact, an other report had Frazier re ceiving intravenous feeding on at least one occasion. According to a hospital spokesman, Frazier had ac companied his manager, Yan cey Durham, there while Dur ham underwent a routine physical examination. Dur ham is a board member of the hospital, which is not far from Frazier's gym, and a long‐time friend of Giuffre. Durham was in London yesterday as a television commentator for the Joe Bug ner‐Henry Cooper heavy weight bout. He had cited the flu as the reason Frazier did not appear with Ali last Sat urday in New York for a videotaped review of their fight. Durham also had men tioned that he advised Frazier not to appear to avoid pos sible embarrassment by Ali. Frazier canceled his sched uled appearance tonight on the “Tonight” television show. “Joe wants to take it easy,” said his public rela tions aide, Joe Goldstein. “He's had about $600,000 in offers for show business, movies, books and appear ances. But he just wants to relax for a couple of weeks. The champion has been in vited to visit President Nixon, address Congress and the South Carolina legislature. He hopes to make a European tour as a singer with his rock band, The Knockouts, beginning in May.

592-> Nixon Confers With Envoys and Top Aides on Curbing Drug Flow
WASHINGTON, June 14—President Nixon summoned six United States ambassadors and Administration officials to the White House today to discuss ways of curbing the flow of narcotics into the United States. Ronald L. Ziegler the White House press secretary told newsmen that much of the discussion had concerned the international drug traffic and that some consideration had been given to the possibility of providing more funds to foreign countries to halt or at least diminish the drug supply at its various sources overseas. Mr. Ziegler also disclosed that Mr. Nixon would unveil “major initiative” later this week, either Wednesday or Thursday, to help deal with the drug problem, which has lately become a matter of intense controversy on Capitol Hill. The proposals which the President outlined to his guests this morning are expected to call for the creation of a new government agency or bureau to help fight narcotics with an initial grant of over $100‐million in Federal funds. New Directives Expected There has also been speculation here that Mr. Nixon's announcement would include new directives to the armed forces to deal with the mounting number of servicemen who have become addicted to drugs during their tours of duty in Vietnam The Senate last week approved an amendment to the draft extension bill that would require the armed forces to identify drug users and to offer them treatment and rehabilitation and there have been hints that Mr. Nixon would propose similar measures. The Senate also included a provision that would permit the United States to use its foreign aid program to help countries producing poppies and other narcotic drug sources to subsidize alternate crops. Mr. Ziegler declined to say whether the forthcoming announcement would include new initiatives to restrict the production of narcotics in nations overseas but the identity of the participants in this morning's meeting suggested that Mr. Nixon might be preparing for a series of joint announcements or bilateral programs with nations where narcotics are produced or where a middleman role is played in the international drug traffic. The envoys on hand were Ellsworth Bunker Ambassador to South Vietnam; Arthur K. Watson, France; Robert H. McBride, Mexico; William J. Handley, Turkey; Leonard Unger Thailand and Kingdon Gould Jr., Luxembourg, which will be the site of a forthcoming international conference on drugs. Government participants in the meeting which lasted nearly two hours included Secretary of State William P. Rogers Attorney General John N. Mitchell Secretary of the Treasury John B. Connally, Jr., and Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Elliot L. Richardson. Also present were Richard Helms, Director of Central Intelligence John Ingersoll Director of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, and various members of the White House staff. The program that Mr. Nixon will unveil this week has been the subject of intense private deliberation at the White House for several months. As the issue has gathered political momentum on Capitol Hill, however, these deliberations have taken on a new sense of urgency, and Mr. Nixon, through various statements and White House meetings, has gone to some lengths to make his own concern for the problem—which Mr. Ziegler today described as “profound”—a matter of public record. “He considers it a major problem,” Mr. Ziegler said, “which we are moving against.” Informed White House sources have said that Mr. Nixon will name Dr. Jerome H. Jaffe, director of the drug abuse program in Illinois, to head the new Federal agency.

594-> What Mothers Will Wear for Bridal
WASHINGTON, June 7 — The White House released to day sketches of the dresses Mrs. Richard M. Nixon and Mrs. Howard Ellis Cox will wear Saturday at the Rose Garden wedding of Tricia Nixon and Edward Finch Cox. The mother of the bride has chosen a dress designed by Priscilla of Boston. It is made of white crepe overlaid with white organdy, totally covered with white blossoms of venise lace and cut‐out em broidered organdy flowers in delicate tones of rose, moss green, mimosa yellow and delphinium blue. The over‐all effect is pastel. Priscilla of Boston, who is Mrs. James Kidder in private life, designed the gowns for Luci Baines Johnson and her attendants in that 1966 wed ding, and for Julie Nixon, her mother and her attendants in 1968, and is doing the dresses for Tricia Nixon and her wed ding party. Mrs. Cox, the mother of the prospective bridegroom, will wear a single‐breasted coat dress of textured Staron silk with sprigs of blue flowers in various shades printed on a white background. It has a V‐neck and large cape collar covering the upper arms and was designed by Betty Kirk for B. L. Griffith of New York City. In the press statement re leased by the White House to day, Mrs. Nixon's dress was described as having “a slen der molded torso with long tapered sleeves and a flared circular skirt. The V'd neck line and afternoon length hem are softened with petalling.” Constance Stuart, Mrs. Nixon's staff director, was asked what, for heaven's sake, was “afternoon length” and answered that it was “just below the knee, not midi” and not long, in keep ing with an afternoon cere mony that will begin at 4 P.M. “Is there a morning length?” someone inquired sweetly of Mrs. Stuart at the press briefing in the White House movie theater. The First Lady's spokesman answered through gritted teeth into the microphone: “Mrs. Nixon will wear her dress where she always wears her dresses, just below the knee.” The President's wife will be shod in azalea‐pink, T strap sandals designed by Beth Levine for Herbert Levine, and will wear short white kid gloves. Mrs. Cox, whose dress has a back‐belted detail that nips the waist slightly above a flared skirt, will wear blue silk pumps and elbow‐length white kid gloves.

595-> Installment Customers Tell Hearing of Bilkings
A Bedford‐Stuyvesant wom an said she was forced to continue payments on a $900 usedicar that broke down three weeks after she bought it. A South Bronx woman said she was dunned for payments on a vocational training course her daughter had signed up for but never actu ally taken. A Spanish‐speaking Bronx man said he had to make pay ments on a $600 English home‐study course even after he was not provided with the materials he had been prom ised. A Staten Island girl said she was hounded by three credit agencies after giving up membership in a health spa that didn't have the swimming pool it had adver tised. They were among the wit nesses who told a Federal Trade Commission hearing here yesterday that custom ers were being bilked of thou sands of dollars because of a loophole in the laws on in stallment plan buying. The loophole involves the “holder in due course” doc trine, under which a retailer, after signing a customer to an installment plan, sells that contract to a bank or fi nance company. The bank is not responsible for the re tailer and can force the cus tomer to fulfill the payment plan even if the product turns out to be defective or if the retailer refuses to honor the warranty. Yesterday's session, the first of three days of hearings at the Federal Building on Foley Square; was held on a proposed change in the Fed eral law that would make the bank or finance company more responsible for the original deal made by the re tailer and allow a customer to stop payment on a bad deal. There were no witnesses from the banking or retail industries yesterday to de fend the doctrine. According to officials of consumer agencies who ap peared yesterday, the stories told by witnesses who felt they were cheated were typi cal of what happens among shady concerns in city slums and suburbs alike. “The problem is most acute with blacks and Puerto Ric ans,” said Reginald Williams, director of the Newark Con sumer Affairs Project. But Mrs. Eve Widdows, director of the Yonkers con sumer protection office, de clared: “Don't assume too much of consumers, even at the highest educational level. People just don't read con tracts.” The Bedford ‐ Stuyvesant woman, Mrs. Leona Wash ington, explained that even after it was discovered that the malfunctioning used car she bought was actually a stolen car, the finance com pany made her continue pay ments on it. The South Bronx woman, Mrs. Sarah, Negron, said that a high‐pressure salesman from the Lafayette School had her sign a blank con tract for her daughter's med ical receptionist training course. He told her, she said, that it was simply to reserve a place in the class. The Staten Island girl, Patricia Ahearn, said that Figure‐tone Spas told her when she signed her contract that they used a credit agency simply to do their bookkeeping. When she tried to get out of the first con tract, it was sold to a second and then a third credit agency. Among those speaking in support of the proposed rule changes yesterday was Betty Furness, chairman of the New York State Consumer Board.

596-> the traveler's world
LET us try this morning to seed and settle the clouds of confusion that have been whipped up over the proposed reduced air fares be tween the United States and Europe effective Feb. 1. It is time to post road signs through the air‐fare debate be cause at 10 o'clock Tuesday morning, Senator Howard W. Cannon, Democrat of Nevada and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Aviation, will gavel open three days of hearings on his bill to give the Civil Aeronautics Board authority to ap prove/disapprove and thus set air fares on international routes to and from the United States. These hearings are an indirect effect of the failure of the airlines through their International Air Transport Asso ciation to agree on new tariffs after meeting from June 29 through the mid dle of August, in one long wrangle in Montreal. Senator Cannon put his bill in late in July when it became appar ent that I.A.T.A. would not reach agree ment. The association recently repeat ed the process in Miami, debating Caribbean, Latin‐American and Pacific fares with little change evidenced in the status quo save some increases in the Pacific. Giving the C.A.B. authority over in ternational fares, similar to its power to set domestic fares, is not a new idea with Senator Cannon and his com mittee. The matter comes up repeated ly, most serious consideration having been in the mid‐sixties when foreign airlines were trying to raise fares and American carriers to lower them. Some airline executives and some observers, including this one, shudder at the thought of the C.A.B. as presently con stituted, having any control over for eign fares. Now for the chaotic and confusing air‐fare picture—just who is confused? Not the traveler, because no matter what the final outcome is in this shake out of the aviation industry, the travel er must benefit. The trend to reduced fares is so firmly established that even if the extreme conservative wing of the industry should recover some of its former power, air fares after Feb. will be lower than they were this year. So who is confused? Those airline executives who have not yet been able to decide how they will meet or match the breakthrough from I.A.T.A.‐approved rates to the low, low fares first offered by Lufthansa, the West German air line. Many carriers have already made their decisions and are no longer con fused; most have announced they will be competitive and will match any re duced fare offered; many have pub lished group and excursion fares of varying degrees of benefit and compli cation to the tourist, effective Feb. Even the diehards, in the secrecy of their head offices, are preparing match ing tariffs to be announced when all their appeals to governments and politi cal pressures have failed. And now to our clarification: Head line writers and airline executives would have you believe this is a rate war to the finish. This is not a rate or price war in the sense of two across‐the street gasoline stations or discount houses slugging it out with steadily de clining prices until one goes broke. In the flurry of big advertisements follow ing I.A.T.A.'s failure at reconciliation, not a single airline promised or threat ened to undercut Lufthansa or anyone else. Each said only that it would be competitive no matter what other lines did, matching whatever fares the com petition (meaning Lufthansa) offered. Since opposing carriers claim they will lose money at the Lufthansa sched ule, and since airlines customarily sell their services at the same price, to the penny, it is a safe bet that the Luft hansa tariffs will be the lowest com mon denominator of all North Atlantic fares come Feb. 1. Betting folk might want to lay out some even money that all the fuss and feathers will vanish into the polluted atmosphere on or about Nov. 15, maybe a week or two earlier. There are some last‐ditch conver sations being pushed to persuade Luft hansa to back down, but time and eco nomics are against further delays. For example, Canada refused to ac cept Lufthansa's filing of new fares on the technicality that it had not held prior discussions with Air Canada as required by treaty. So Lufthansa is go ing to talk with Air Canada, but what can Air Canada do? New York and Boston are an hour from Montreal and Toronto; if Canada rejects Lufthansa's fares and its airlines charge higher, old‐fashioned I.A.T.A. fares, how long will it take Canadian tourists to fly to Boston or New York to avail themselves of the $210 winter season, $270 summer season, round‐trip excursions to Germany? An hour and less than $60 Canadian money. Geogra phy and the customer's ingenuity limit government's and an airline's intransi gence once competition replaces price fixing by association. Travel agents are pressuring the air lines to decide new fares so they can print brochures with tour prices and start selling trips for next spring and summer. The airlines cannot wait much longer if they want their share of the 1972 traffic. Economic pressure is about to overcome pride, prejudice and faith in the I.A.T.A. fare structure. The American Society of Travel Agents fought a hard but losing battle, inter posing against the reduced fares and in behalf of I.A.T.A. This could be con fusing in that it took an anti‐customer attitude, except that A.S.T.A. is closely related to the aviation industry estab lishment and, more important, its agent members live on commissions, about per cent on airplane tickets, 10 per cent if the plane ticket is included in a package involving hotel and ground services. Now let's take a moment to review what happened in Montreal, where the 120‐odd airlines sought new fares to stimulate traffic and fill empty seats. By mid‐August, everyone but Lufthansa had wearily accepted a complicated set of I.A.T.A. fares including reduced stu dent fares and a discount for travelers who would commit themselves months in advance and pay in full in advance. The variations and group rates left I.A.T.A. with between 50 and 60 North Atlantic fares. Lufthansa rejected them all and after due warning announced its own sched ule of four fares for the winter season, four for the summer peak, leaving first class unchanged. Summer round‐trip economy was cut from $636 to $540; winter economy from $536 to $420; the summer $372 and $442 excursions were replaced by one 14–45‐day excur sion at $270 ($210 in the winter); this also replaced group inclusive tours; af finity groups were eliminated, and youth fares stabilized at $240 summer peak against $228 last summer, $195 winter time against $210. All these fares are New York/Boston to all German cities, including Berlin. Opposing airlines put up a pretty good propaganda fight against this re duction and simplification. Pan Ameri can World Airways and Trans World Airlines went jointly to the C.A.B. in what the airlines expected would be confidential session wherein they could appeal to the C.A.B. to help fight Luft hansa. They hoped C.A.B. would ask the Department of State to intercede with the Foreign Minister of West Ger many and call Lufthansa off. The C.A.B. quite properly said no, this was public business, and insisted on an open meeting. Pan American said Lufthansa's schedule might increase traf traffic 26.5 per cent but said it expected to lose $32‐million at those rates. T.W.A. estimated its losses at $28‐million. Secor D. Browne, chairman of the C.A.B., said he had no intention of raising air‐fare negotiations to the level of diplomatic negotiations. C.A.B.'s po sition on its authority in fare fixing should be outlined early in the Cannon hearings when Browne testifies as one of the key witnesses. Meanwhile, back at the mimeograph machine, American and foreign supple mental or nonscheduled airlines have accused all the I.A.T.A. lines of delib erately trying to put them out of busi ness. Official protestations to the con trary, they are probably right. The Lufthansa fares and the resultant fares to North Atlantic gateway cities now being bruited about—$190 round‐trip ex cursion New York‐London/Paris; maybe $200 to Brussels/Amsterdam; $210 or $220 to Rome—run pretty close to what the supplementals have been charging for charter trips. Some reports claimed Lufthansa ex ecutives had announced they would in cur great losses with their new fares. A Lufthansa official told me this was not true, said his company had said it would expect to lose $8‐million with the proposed I.A.T.A. fares, might break even or turn a small profit with its new fares. Supplementals say that as soon as they are driven out of the market, air fares will start rising again. This has happened before, noticeably when the United States Government drove sup plementals off the transcontinental run several years ago and made the then $88 scheduled airline round‐trip disap pear forever. Scheduled airlines in private moments take wry amusement in the predica ment of the Nixon Administration, the Pentagon and Congress, which helped build up giant supplemental jet airlines for the Vietnam war airlift. Now, those highly placed politicians are obligated, morally or otherwise, to protect the big businesses created at their patriotic requests. Domestic airlines are gingerly sup porting the I.A.T.A. fare‐subscribing air lines because if you can fly New York London/Paris for $190, what justice is there in a New York‐Los Angeles/San Francisco economy round trip at $326? From the East Coast it has been cheaper to ski in Europe than in the American Rockies, and at some seasons, Europe is a less expensive holiday than the Caribbean. For their part, domestic air lines have merely been busy adding gimmick discounts (four‐day specials you bring your wife along) and new group fare reductions to compete with the Feb. 1 Atlantic rates. Need the potential traveler now pan ic among all this well‐organized chaos? No, just sit tight until the dust settles any day now, for competitive stability is just around the corner. Reliable trav el agents and airlines promise to adjust tickets and tours sold now down to whatever fares prevail Feb. 1 and at time of departure. Just don't pay too much attention to the rhetoric and purplish prose. Remem ber that much testimony before the Cannon committee will have a nonob jective bias. Just take it all with a grain of salt and accept the few good breaks that come along like the $228 KLM sum mer senior citizen fare ($190 in win ter), which equalizes travelers aged 12 through 21 and those 65 and over on the way to Amsterdam.

597-> Gen. Joseph O. Mauborgne Dies; Chief Signal Officer of the Army
ATLANTA, June 7 — Maj. Gen. Joseph O. Mauborgne, U.S.A., retired, died Saturday in a nursing home near here after a long illness. He was 90 years old. General Mauborgne was chief signal officer of the Army from 1937 to 1941 when he retired. Born in Brooklyn, he enlisted in 1903 and made the Army his career. After he retired he lived in Little Silver, N. J., for 30 years, moving to Atlanta last year. Surviving are his widow, the former Katherine Poore; a son, Col. Benjamin J. Mauborgne, U.S.A., retired, and one grand child. As a lieutenant in the Signal Corps stationed at Fort Riley, Kan. in 1912, General Mau borgne installed a radio trans mitter in a plane, rigged a rep ceiving antenna on the ground and achieved the first recorded air‐to‐ground transmission. The pilot, Lieut. H. H. Arnold, be came commanding general of the Army Air Forces in World War II. In 1937 he was promoted to Chief Signal Officer with the rank of major general. In mod ernizing Army communications as World War II approached, he was duly publicized for re tiring the relatively leisurely Morse Code in favor of swifter telephonic and radio links. Less noted, but of greater historical significance, was his role in cryptography, which had interested him since 1914 when he was credited with be ing the first to break the Brit ish field code known as Play fair. In World War I he had also promoted the first automa tic cipher machine. On taking over as Chief Sig nal Officer he gave strong im petus to the work already started under the code name MAGIC to break the communi cations codes of the Japanese armed forces. He got more man power and facilities and inten sified training, as well as add ing the important incentive of his own competence in the field to draw out the best ef forts of his subordinates. Although he was relieved of his duties even before the end of his term and retired at the end of September, 1941, because of a quarrel with the Air Corps over procurement of communi cations equipment, his role in establishing the team that broke the Japanese codes before Pearl Harbor was not forgotten by insiders. In 1945 after the victory in the Pacific, the investigation into the responsibility for un preparedness at Pearl Harbor despite the intelligence inter cepts heard testimony from Major General Sherman Miles, the 1941 chief of Army intelli gence. He said it was the Signal Corps that actually broke the codes and that General Matt borgne was entitled to great credit for it.

598-> Headstart: The Torment of ABC's
On January 1 I became director of the Addie Mae Collins Headstart on Fifth Avenue and 127th Street. On Mardh 29 I resigned. During those three months I dis covered flaws in the goals that govern the development and growth of chil dren in Headstart classrooms. I would like to recall here certain events in those three months with the hope that recalling them might ignite some self criticism within the dark, tormented powers of the Headstart bureaucracy that has control over the lives of children in Harlem. • • • Mrs. L. is a young woman from the Midwest who wanders around her classroom with a wistful confusion. Children, to her, are obstacles to over come, things to be studied and, as she told me, “prepared for the future.” I walked into her classroom once and found her sitting on a bench in front of 15 silent, unsmiling children, drill ing them over and over in a dreadful little number‐learning song about blackbirds. The third time around I asked her why she was repeating it so often. She said: “I planned one hour of work for the children and they finished the work in half an hour. What can I do?” I said: “Do nothing. Call, up your husband, take a walk. Just leave the children alone.” She left. The children watched as if they were mice watch ing the departure of a cat. Soon they, were laughing; screaming, running, playing, rolling on the floor. They were being simply children. A parent arrived and said to me, in rage: “Oh, you're one of those who be lieve in open classrooms. I think this is terrible. Where's the teacher? Get her in here and make her stop that noise.” Parents in Harlem have an obses sion about “teaching.” They insist that their children “learn” and learning is in their minds alphabets, numbers, let ters and the practical application of those skills now. Parents want to see and hear their children proving to them that Headstart teaches. But no one ever asked me during those three months what precisely goes on in a child's mind as he learns letters and numbers. Headstart stifles the imagination of children by imposing, like an iron mask—what ought to be glorious, free form clays of childhood‐the torment of having to learn reading, writing and arithmetic. An open classroom means nothing to me unless it means that a child learns in that classroom that learning is not dependent at every level on the presence of a teacher. An open classroom always praises the genius of a child's imagination. * * * I passed Mrs. R.'s classroom and saw‐the children lined up in front of her on little chairs, looking at the letter M printed on a large piece of cardboard. The assistant teacher in a blue smock sat behind them. The chil dren said nothing, asked nothing. I told Mrs. R. to stop. “Put on a record and let them dance,” I said. The poor girl looked at me, wept and locked herself in the bathroom. Lilly, an assistant teacher in another class, had drawn an enormous cat with a skirt, a flowered bonnet and booties. She was busily coloring it. I took the cat away from her and laid it on the floor and told the children to color it. They did, but fearfully, for in their classroom the “work” was done by the teachers and then “presented” to the children They looked at me, then at Lilly and slowly they began to crawl over the cat—it was drawn on a piece of wrapping paper about five feet long. They embellished that cat with imagination: little flashes of colorthey called houses, flowers and flames. Lilly was furious. “The parents run this classroom,” eight teachers shouted at me the day I resigned. “They tell us what to do and we do it.” Headstart is simply another way for the schools to make sure that children come into them “prepared” and that means that they come docile, drilled in alphabets and silence. I re signed and the teachers and the par ents had won a victory. Nothing had been dared and nothing would be. Mrs. L., Mrs. R., Lilly and the par ents have no time to look at the chil dren. To them, Headstart children are messes to be set right, dullards to be fed knowledge, undisciplined animals to be tamed. It is time now to chal lenge Headstart assumptions, methods, reasons for being to be sure it is not simply just another place to torment children and cripple their powers of growth and joy.

599-> CONCORDE, IN BRAZIL ENDS ATLANTIC TRIP
RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept. 6—The British‐French supersonic airliner Concorde landed here today completing its first transAtlantic trip. It flew from Cayenne, French Guiana, at 1,350 miles an hour, twice the speed of sound. The jetliner left France last week and stopped at the Cape Verde Islands and Cayenne. Officials said that it had not been equipped with reserve fuel tanks, which would have made possible a nonstop flight. The plane will be demonstrated to officials of four South American airlines—Varig of Brazil, Aerolineas Argentinas, Avianca of Colombia and Viasa of Venezuela. It is to be flown to Sao Paulo, Latin America's principal industrial center, for a French industrial fair that opens Thursday, and then is to fly to Argentina.

600-> GEORGE FRANKEL, OILMAN, 78, DIES
GREENWICH, Conn., April 7 George Frankel, a successful Texas independent oil man who withdrew 20 years ago to concentrate on philanthropy and public affairs, died today in Greenwich Hospital. He was 78 years old and lived on John Street. Mr. Frankel, who was born in New York and had some early education there, turned in the 1920's with his brother Frank to independent oil production in Texas. One of the major philanthropies was the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, of which lie was secretary of the board of overseers at his death. An original overseer and founder, he created with his wife the radiation‐therapy center in the college hospital and the Institute of Neopathology and Prenatal Pathology in the Rose Kennedy Center for Research in Mental Retardation and Human Development. Another was the National Cystic Ribrosis Foundation, which he helped guide from a local to a national activity. He was a director of the Southbury (Conn.) Training School for Retarded Children and for many year's a governor of New Rochelle Hospital. With his late wife, the former Elizabeth Flaherty, Mr. Frankel established the George and Elizabeth F. Frankel Foundation in 1945. He leaves three daughters, Mrs. Norman A. Bock of Houston and Mrs. Robert F. Telcin and Mrs. Norman J. Merksamer, both of Scarsdale, N. Y.; a son, G. David Frankel of Harrison, N. Y.; three brothers, Bernard, Frank and Jacob, and nine grandchildren. A funeral service will be at the Riverside Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue and 76th Street in New York, on Friday at 10 A.M.

603-> YANKEES CONQUER RED SOX, 5‐3, 3‐0, SINOBODA EXCELS
Although Bobby Murcer, the team's leading hitter, was hospitalized with a kidney ailment, the Yankees experienced one of the few completely pleasurable days of a disappointing season yesterday by sweeping a double‐header from the Boston Red Sox, 5.3 and 3‐0, at Yankee Stadium. A crowd of 21,490, which sent New York over the one‐million attendance mark, for the 26th straight year, roared with approval as the Yankees fought back, from an early 3‐1 deficit to win the opener on Ron Swoboda's two‐run pinch single in the eighth inning and his amazing catch that preserved the triumph in the top of the ninth. After scoring a run in the seventh, Jake Gibbs's leadoff homer in the eighth tied the score at 3‐3 and Felipe Alou and Roy White followed with singles off Ray Culp, the Boston starter who lost his 14th decision. An error by Reggie Smith‐in center field on White's single permitted the runners to move to second and third. Bill Lee, a left‐hander, replaced Culp and Ralph Houk, the Yankee manager, sent Swoboda to bat for Ron Blomberg. With the Boston infield drawn in for a play at the plate, Swoboda looped a single into left field and Carl Yastrzemski—who had thrown out two previous Yankees at the plate —had no play as Alou and White hustled home. Yastrzemski drew a base on balls off Roger Hambright, the young Yankee relief pitcher, to open the Boston ninth. Smith then slammed a liner that was heading for one of the first rows of the lower right‐field stands. But Swoboda leaped high into, the air, grabbed the ball and dropped down, hard on the four‐foot fence. He avoided falling into the stands by spinning on the railing and falling back onto the field with the ball in his glove. “I thought it was a homer for sure,” said Houk afterward. Swoboda saved the game,” Hambright nailed down his second triumph by retiring Billy Conigliaro on a fly and Mike Fiore on a strikeout. Danny Cater led the 14‐hit attack in the opener with a double and three singles, He drove in the first New York run in the fourth and scored ihe second on Jerry Kenney's single in the seventh. John Kennedy's fifth homer was the only extra‐base hit off Steve Kline, the Yankee starter. Yastrzemski, whose fine fielding is often overshadowed by his batting feats, used his powerful arm to throw out Yankees attempting to score from second base on singles to left. Cater, in the second, and Clarke, in the seventh, found the ball waiting for them at the plate. The second game was scoreless for 7½ innings as Stan Bahnsen dueled with John Curtis, a left‐hander making his first major league start. But the Boston defense let down Curtis and the Yankees tallied three times in the eighth to compete the sweep, their sixth of the year. With one out, Ron Hansen beat out a hit to shortstop and Frank Baker, running for Hansen, reached second when Carlton Fisk, the Boston catcher, threw late to second on Bahnsen's sacrifice bunt. Clarke then broke the deadlock with a triple up the rightcenter alley. He scored a moment later on Roy White's sacrifice fly to center. White tied the American League record of 16 sacrifice flies that was set by Sam Crawford and Chick Gandil in 1914. The National League record of 19 is held by Gil. Hodges, who did it in 1954 with Brooklyn. Manager Eddie Kasko of Boston started four rookies from their Louisville farm team and Rico Petrocelli In the second game. Kasko and Petrocelli earlier discussed statements attributed to Petrocelli in Boston papers recently, criticizing Kasko's managing. Kasko said the two had come to an understandin. Petrocelli did not play in the first game. Murcer, who is hitting 322 with 23 home runs and 85 runs batted in, was taken to Lenox Hill Hospital at 5 A.M. yesterday after experiencing kidney pains. The ailment was tentatively diagnosed as renal colic, which involves granules or stones in the kidney. He will undergo tests today to determine exactly the extent and nature of the ailment. “We're going to miss Bobby,” said Houk. “We can't afford to have him out for long. Even if we did manage to take two today without him.”

604-> Japanese Tug‐of‐Bottle: Chivas vs. Johnny Black
Seagram & Sons of the United States goes according to the two companies' plans. TOKYO, May 23—“Shibas” may oust “Jonikuro” from its position as the king of imported Scotch whiskies, if the tie‐up announced last week between Kirin beer of Japan and Generations of Japanese snobs have extolled the virtues of “Jonikuro” — Johnny Walker Black Label. Even among peo ple who could not distinguish between Scotch and bourbon, Johnny Walker Black Label was the ultimate gift, as good as the crisp 10,000‐yen note ($28) it still costs despite “liberaliza tion” of whisky earlier this year. Much to Seagram's chagrin, “Shibas” — Chivas Regal — has been scarcely known outside a small circle of industrial lead ers, and its price in Japan has been 2,000 yen ($5.55) less than that of Johnny Walker Black Label. Now, however, Seagram's, the world's largest distiller with sales last year of $1.6‐billion, has announced a sales agree ment with Kirin, Japan's larg est brewery, whose share of the domestic beer market dur ing the last quarter was 62.9 per cent. (Total sales in 1970 were $899‐million.) The agreement gives Kirin exclusive distribution rights for all Seagram products in Japan, ranging from Scotch to bourbon to Canadian whiskies, gin, rum, vodka, wine and cognac. Eventually, Seagrams is said to be aiming to manufacture whiskies in Japan in a joint venture with Kirin. However, Kirin's president, Asajiro Taka hashi, took a cautious and non committal attitude toward this prospect at a news conference. In Japan's highly competitive beer industry, major brew eries are lined up with the zaibatsu, the former financial family trusts such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Sumitomo. Kirin is associated with powerful Mit subishi. And Mitsubishi employ es, it is said, are strictly en joined neither to offer or accept any brand other than Kirin ex cept in the privacy of their homes. It was Yoichiro Makita, pres ident of the giant Mitsubishi heavy industries who discov ered Chivas Regal on a trip abroad many years ago and who still offers it to his friends. Other Japanese companies are lining up with foreign li quor manufacturers. Suntory, Japan's biggest whisky maker, which imports its malt from Scotland, has a tie‐up with John Haig & Co. of Britain. The Sapporo brewery has em barked on a joint venture with the trading company of Mitsui & Co. to import and sell Hen nessy cognac White Horse and J&B whisky. The Japanese, whose only drink used to be are increasingly turning to foreign wines and spirits as they savor their new‐found affluence. The market for these wines and spirits is expected to grow spectacularly during the coming years.

605-> Some ‘Solid Refreshment’ For Motorists In Vermont
BURLINGTON, Vt.—On the theory that man should feed his soul as well as his stomach at road side rest areas, Vermont has placed massive pieces of concrete or marble sculpture in every major rest area along Interstate 89 and Interstate 91. Foliage pilgrims thus have extra reason to pause these roadside sites this fall. The two superhighways have become super art galleries from the Massachusetts to Canadian borders as a result of International Sculpture Symposiums held in the state this past summer and in the summer 1968, both under the direction of Vermont sculptor Paul Aschenhach and sponsored by the National En dowment for the Arts. The summer ’71 symposium produced 450 tons of reinforced concrete sculpture 11 works; the 1968 event produced eight works, all native marble. This summer's session lasted eight weeks. The group of American and international artists worked in a cooperative venture with employes of the S. T. Griswold Company outside the company's concrete manufacturing plant in Williston. Passers‐by, caught up in the obvious enthusiasm of the workers, often pitched in to help. They were welcomed. Initial response to the sculptures from a motor ing public more familiar with litter than art at road side rest stops can best be described as “mixed.” “Hey, Dad, what's that?” Dad usually admits he doesn't quite know. But he is sure that it shouldn't be touched. He's wrong. The massive sculptures are meant to be patted, rubbed, climbed on and explored from every angle. Children feel this freedom instinctively. The artists hope that adults may recapture it.

606-> WITH RULES EASED, G.I.'S STAY AT BASE
CANTHO, South Vietnam, July 19—The G.I.'s are not vis iting the Toots Short Bar and Scientific Massage Parlor the way they used to, and the cyclo drivers and the urchins who of fer heroin for sale on the streets of this dirty delta city cannot remember when the price has been so low. In Toots Short's and the Edge City or the Beatles Bar, the dark‐eyed hostesses are bunched at the open door and beckon to American passers‐by, but only a few soldiers sit along the bar behind them. Instead, the men from the Cantho Army air field are stay ing home. They can take a swim in the new pool or catch a movie matinee with their girl friends at the base movie house. They can even take the girls back to the barracks for a little midafternoon privacy— “and anything they want to do, as long as the girls are off post by curfew,” as a G.I. put it. The change came about at the end of last month, when the United States command in the Mekong Delta ordered a sudden crackdown on heroin use, seal ing all military bases and sub jecting everything entering and leaving — including helicopter gunships headed for combat—to rigorous search. During the two‐week crack‐ down, which affected 16,000 men throughout the delta, over 300 heroin users turned them selves in for treatment, many of them in the throes of forced withdrawal. During the period of restric tion to base, the command launched a program to build recreational facilities for the 2,000 men of the Cantho air base as well as liberalizing, by unwritten consent, the rules governing the presence of women. Tennis courts are being built and a football field is planned. After the exertions of sport the soldier can visit the base's own Magic Fingers Massage Parlor, which is franchised by the post exchange. When the crackdown was ended, just 15 per cent of the men in each unit were granted passes at any time to visit Cantho's Bus Stop, the wide honky‐tonk thoroughfare that serves as an interprovincial bus depot and has attracted the same bars, prostitutes and dis reputable hotels that are found around the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan. The United States command expected a rush to fill the quotas for passes when the re strictions were lifted July 3, but, as a spokesman for the base put it, “they just don't seem to be interested in that stuff down there any more.” The men confirming this, say that after two weeks on base they did not feel like going back to the clip joints, the wa tered liquor and grasping, hard‐ eyed bar girls and the indif ferent sex partners. “I thought I'd go when they'd let me,” Specialist 4 Mike Scheeler said as he recalled the crackdown, “but then the time came and I figured it wasn't worth it. The girls down there —they are really weird—they hassle you, and the kids hassle you for piasters and then the M.P.'s hassle you for drugs when you came back through the gates. “You come back from down there feeling empty,” he added, “and besides, I got used to staying on the base.” Many of the men also got used to staying off heroin. “Scag is out, man,” said a G.I. who had stopped using it. “It used to be $3 a vial, and during the crackdown they were selling it on post for $40. Guys figured it just wasn't worth it. And once most guys came down, they took a look at themselves and said, ‘Wow, man, I'm down!’ You know, and they stayed down.”

607-> STOCKS IN LONDON RETAIN FIRMNESS
The over‐all tone of prices on the London Stock Exchange remained firm yesterday even though leading issues failed to hold Tuesday's large after hours gains. The Financial Times index of 30 industrial stocks closed nearly 9 points lower at 344.2, and trading volume was the highest recorded so far this year. Selective buying, mainly for banking, utility and pharma ceutical issues, helped sustain the Milan market, but an easier trend developed that caused a mixed close. The Tokyo market closed slightly higher after initial liquidation attracted some buying for some lower priced issues. The exchange's closing aver age was 2,403.30, up 1.97, with trading volume estimated at 220 million shares. Prices on the Toronto ex change were up sharply in late trading. The Montreal market moved higher in moderately ac tive trading.

608-> Britain May Also Act
WASHINGTON, April 1— United States military planes will begin evacuating depend ents of American officials and private United States citizens from East Pakistan tomorrow, the State Department an nounced today. It was understood that Brit ain would also begin airlifting British subjects from the area, which has been torn by civil strife for a week. As the United States made its decision to move, Senator Edward M. Kennedy charged that the Nixon Administration was in effect suppressing re ports from East Pakistan of “indiscriminate” killing, con tinuing fighting and a mount ing threat of famine. Official sources said that American C‐130 transport planes would fly in from Utaphao air base, Thailand, and would take the Americans from Dacca in East Pakistan to Bangkok, Thailand. Smaller air planes may lift some out from the Chittagong airport. It had been hoped that chartered civil ian aircraft could be used, offi cials said, to reduce the air of emergency in deference to the Pakistani Government, which has announced that calm is rapidly returning to East Pakistan. Officials said that current plans called for only one air plane to fly in each day to soften any hint of emergency. “This is not an emergency evacuation,” the State Depart ment spokesman insisted. “This is a temporary reduction in number of Americans in East Pakistan.” He conceded, nonetheless, that although the evacuation of private American citizens would be optional, dependents of United States officials would have to leave. Civilian airlines refused to risk landing at Dacca, where Pakistani troops are said to guard both the airport and the control tower. Experienced Ben gali air controllers have fled, sources here say. United States military planes, which have had their own ladders and starting equipment therefore had to be used. Charles W. Bray, 3d, the State Department spokesman, said that the United States intended to leave a substantial number of the 80 American officials in East Pakistan at the consulate general. Otherwise, he intimated, virtually all the 705 Americans in the area would be flown out. While reluctant to go into details—again in deference to White House orders not to in flame Pakistani opinion — Mr. Bray indicated that disruption of mail, telephone and other community services, plus the closing of schools, made it im possible for the American com munity to lead a normal life. Senator Kennedy's statement did not identify the source of the reports reaching his Senate refugee subcommittee. The re ports charge systematic execu tion of dissident Bengali politi cal leaders and students by the Pakistani armed forces. Staff aides said, however, that duplicates of cablegrams from Archer K. Blood, the United States consul general at Dacca, were circulating widely throughout the State and De fense Departments, the Agency for International Development, the Central Intelligence Agency and other branches of the Fed eral bureaucracy. They indicated that officials concerned over conditions in East Pakistan and offended by the White House orders for tight secrecy had furnished the gist of the reports to Senators and Representatives. Senator Fred R. Harris, Democrat of Oklahoma, called on the Nixon Administration to cut off all military and economic aid to Pakistan until it was clear whether there had been a mass slaughter of East Pakistanis. Officials said that economic aid to Pakistan was running at $100‐million yearly. Military aid that began in 1954 was cut off in 1965 after the Indian Pakistani war. Its total at that time, they said, was approxi mately $750‐million. Academic leaders at Harvard, who declined to be identified, said that several of their num ber with experience in Paki stan had telephoned Henry A. Kissinger, President Nixon's adviser on national security, to urge United States pressure on Pakistan to restrain her troops, restore civilian rule and permit the delivery of food, medical supplies and other relief goods. They declined to describe Mr. Kissinger's response.

611-> Bridge: Roth‐Rappaport Team Wins Another Open Pair Title Here
One of the country's top ranked mixed partnerships added another victory Satur day to a long string of suc cesses in New York tourna ments. Alvin Roth of New York and Barbara Rappaport of East Orange, N. J. won the two‐session Open J., Cham pionship in the Washington's Birthday tournament of the Greater New York Bridge Association. The tournament ends today, with the Mixed Pair Championship scheduled at 1 and 7 P.M. Winners of other major events were: Men's Pairs—Ralph Chafetz and Dan Bingel of New York. Women's Pairs—Elizabeth Gross of Bayside, Queens, and Boots Conn of Rockaway Park, Queens. Mixed Teams—Henry Bethe, Ed Pinner, Amalya Kearse and Nancy Lincoln, all of New York. Novice Pairs—Elissa Gordon of New York and S. M. Mahajan of Hoboken, N. J. The diagramed deal from the Men's Pairs was reward ing for some bold spirits. At most tables North‐South reached five clubs, usually making just 11 tricks. A few South players reached an am bitious six clubs, in one case by the abrupt auction shown in the diagram. After North had opened one spade, East had no clear‐cut action. A take‐out double is unwise with a markedly two‐ suited hand, and an overcall in one of the suits risked los ing the other. Some players were able to use specialized cue‐bids aimed at indicating a two‐suiter. The Michaels cue‐bid, for example, popular in tournament play, shows the unbid major and an un disclosed minor when used over a major suit. When East chose to over call two hearts, in the hope of bidding diamonds on the next round, South made an imaginative leap to the club slam. He felt confident that he would be able to ruff hearts in the dummy. Spectacular jumps to slam are usually based on hands with a void suit: The avoid ance of Blackwood suggests that information about aces would not be helpful. West might therefore have hit on a trump lead, which would have given South no chance to make 12 tricks. Oddly enough, a spade lead would also have been devas tating, cutting South's com munications. Even if the declarer had finessed the queen, he would have had no way to cash the spade ace after ruffing two hearts in the dummy. In practice West made the routine lead of a heart, and South was in control. He could crossruff in the red suits, draw trumps, and eventually take the spade finesse, mak ing in all nine trump tricks and three tricks in the major suits. Even after the heart lead, however, a good declarer might have been defeated by subtle discarding from East. That player could have given a plausible imitation of a man trying to keep a guarded spade king. After South has crossruffed and cashed all but one of his trumps the position could be: East has carefully dis carded his ace and king of diamonds, preserving his queen as a hidden asset. On the lead of the last trump, East throws away one of his hearts. South is sure to think that East's last three cards arc the heart king and the guarded spade king, so he will lead a heart with some confidence expecting an end play. He will be distinctly unhappy when East produces the diamond queen at the 12th trick.

612-> STORY RIGHTS SOLD IN CRIMMINS CASE
The prosecution in the trial of Mrs. Alice Crimmins disclosed yesterday that she had signed a contract with her former lawyer giving him the motion‐picture, book and magazine rights to the story of her case. Harold C. Harrison, who represented Mrs. Crimmins three years ago when she was on trial for the murder of her daughter, appeared as a defense witness yesterday in an attempt to discredit certain allegations by Joseph Rorech, the key prosecution witness. Last week, Mr. Rorech testified that the 32‐year‐old defondant said that she had killed her daughter, and had “agreed” to the death of her son. The prosecution, however, attempted to discredit Mr.Harrison as well, by indicating that he had a strong financial interest in the outcome of Mrs. Crimmins's current trial for murder and manslaughter in the death of her children. Under questioning, Mr. Harrison conceded that he had asked Mrs. Crimmins to sign the contract while she was in jail after being convicted of manslaughter in 1968. She had no money to pay for an appeal, he said. That verdict, however, was later overturned after Herbert A. Lyon, the current defense lawyer, took the case. “Do you know how much that contract is worth?” Thomas Demakos, the assistant district attorney asked Mr. Harrison. “I don't know.” he replied. “How much that contract is worth certainly depends on the outcome of this trial, doesn't it? Mr. Demakos said. “I don't know,” Mr. Harrison answered again. The main focus of Mr. Harrison's testimony, however, concerned “Vinnie Colabella,” who, Mr. Rorech testified, Mrs. Crimmins said was with her the night the children were slain. Mr. Harrison's account—that he heard from clients of his in a Queens jail that another prisoner had been asked to testify against Mrs. Crimmins in return for “consideration”—corroborated Mr. Rorech's version. The lawyer emphasized, however, that Mrs. Crimmins insisted she had never heard of Vinnie Colabella and, therefore, he had “never tried to contact him.” According to prosecution sources; Mr. Colabella is serving a 20‐year prison sentence for bank robbery in the Federal penitentiary in Danbury, Cann. Throughout his testimony, Mr. Harrison pictured Joseph Rorech—who initially was also his client—as a man who was convinced Mrs. Crimmins was innocent. “Many, many times,” he said, Mr. Rorech “told me they were Proiecuting the wrong person and, that she wasn't even capable of doing it.” The defense will continue to present its case in State Supreme Court in Queens at 10 A.M. today.

613-> Manila Reviews Links to U.S. In Light of New China Policy
MANILA, July 24 — The an nouncement of President Nix on's forthcoming visit to Peking has raised doubts among Philip pine leaders about continued American support, and they have called for a complete re view of Philippine relations with the United States. The Foreign Policy Council, comnosed of leaders of the ex ecutive and legislative brancnes of government, is preparing a reassessment of military and economic treaties with the United States. The person who appears most pessimistic over the relations between the two countries is President Ferdinand E. Marcos, who said to newsmen Monday night: “If this can happen to Nationalist China, there is no assurance that this won't hap pen to us.” In a speech Tuesday before the Sugar Club, consisting of leaders of the Philippines' im portant sugar industry, Mr. Marco's said: “I am certain that this alteration and change in the policy of the United States will now mean that every Asian nation and leader must now re view the basis for all the agree ments between the United States and their respective countries.” Mr. Marcos said that “with these new policies of the Amer ican Government and of Red China, anything is possible in Asia, and we must prepare for anything.” He told the sugar industry men they should prepare for loss of their preferential market in the United States in the im mediate future. He urged them to explore world market quotas and reduce their projected out put by diversifying production on their crop areas. The future of economic re lations between the two coun tries is increasingly uncertain as the expiration of the Laurel‐ Langley Agreement, the main accord governing commercial exchanges, approaches. The agreement runs out in 1974. President Marcos said that other economic treaties also were up for review. In the military field, Mr. Mar cos said he wanted to clarify what he called a misapprehen sion among “experts in the United States that in the event of a revolution, we would call upon the U.S. under the mutual defense treaty for assistance, particularly foot troops.” Today in northern Luzon, Mr. Marcos said the Philippines would sound out other Asian nations on the possibility of holding a meeting in Manila to discuss the implications of the United States' new policy toward Communist China.

614-> CHEATING ALLEGED ON ARMY EXAMS
OKLAHOMA CITY, Feb. 14 (AP)—Two former Army lieu tenants say that superiors allowed officers to cheat on qualifying exams for posts that put them in a position to supervise the firing of defen sive nuclear missiles, according to The Daily Oklahoman. The newspaper said in to day's editions that the two recently discharged missile of ficers asserted that the use of unauthorized aids and even copies of the tests helped gain qualification for battery con trol officers. An article by Ron Fulkerson said that battery control of ficers were in a position to supervise the firing of the nuclear‐capable missiles of the Nike‐Hercules defense system in case of attacks. The assertions in the article were made by Lieut. Earl M. Bricker, now of Norman, and Lieut. Casey J. Sauers of Pasa dena, Calif. Both men are currently United States Army Reserve officers, the paper said. The lieutenants charged in the article that they brought the alleged cheating to the at tention of superior officers at the Nike‐Hercules battalion of Miami‐Homestead Defense, with headquarters at Home stead Air Force Base, Fla. The battalion is a part of the North American Air Defense Com mand. Lieutenants Bricker and Sauers told The Daily Oklaho man that, despite presentation of sworn, official affidavits and confidential recordings to Homestead officials, no thor ough military investigation had been made. The officers said they first notified officials of the alleged cheating on Jan. 10, 1969. At Homestead, Col. Sylvan Salter, an overseer of the mis sile sites, said that an officer had been admonished in con nection with the case and that all officers who had taken the test were re‐examined. He said that it was his understanding that the officer in question had passed on verbal test questions and answers. After this discovery, Colonel Salter said, the officer “was admonished” and the methods of giving the examinations were changed. He declined to identify the officer, but said that he was a lieutenant still serving at Homestead. The Daily Oklahoma said mil itary records had shown that an investigation of the situation was ended in July, 1970, but that the “board failed to call almost every officer implicated, saying that they had been reas signed to other duty sites.” The paper cited no reason for the alleged cheating.

615-> Congress Braces for a Battle Over Campaign Spending Curbs
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14— Congress is bracing for what is likely to be the first major political battle of the new ses sion, the issue of regulating campaign spending. The outcome is almost cer tain to affect the 1972 Presi dential election, either by es tablishing stringent new ground rules for the candidates or by enabling one of them to blame the other for the absence of any limitation on the skyrocket ing costs of campaigning for political office. Unlike most of the major questions before the 92d Con gress, which are likely to sim mer along with little action for a year or more, campaign fi nancing legislation will prob ably be considered within the next six or eight months, relatively short time by Capi tol Hill standards. This is true because any new law affecting election spending for 1972 must be on the books by the end of this year to apply to the Presiden tial primary campaigns, which traditionally get under way in New Hampshire in January. Four months ago, President Nixon vetoed a bill that would have limited television and radio spending in political campaigns, in part on the ground that it should have re stricted other types of spend ing as well. Democratic leaders were highly critical of the Presi dent's veto, contending that he had acted to perpetuate the traditional Republican advan tage in fund raising. They were unable, however, to override the veto despite Democratic majorities in Congress. In any event, the bill was too late to have affected the 1970 cam paign. The major question in, the renewal of the controversy this year is the attitude of the White House. At the time of the veto, the Administration had no plans to draft any al ternative legislation, although Mr. Nixon acknowledged in his disapproval message that the problem was serious and the effort to meet it laudable. Senator Hugh Scott of Penn sylvania, the minority floor leader, is drafting a bill than will be submitted to the White House before it is made public. That could either become the official Republican proposal or wind up as the Scott bill. Representative John B. An derson of Illinois, chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, introduced a tough bill late last year for which he tried to obtain White House endorsement and failed. It would have imposed dollar spending limits on national and Congressional candidates, about $7‐million for those running for President. Although it can arouse strong partisan responses, campaign spending is by no means an issue that the Democrats uni formly promote and the Repub licans similarly oppose. If all the Democratic Senators had voted to override the Nixon veto last November, the move would have succeeded. In addition, one of the prin cipal campaign bills before the new Congress is cosponsored by Senators Mike Gravel, Dem ocrat of Alaska, and James B. Pearson, Republican of Kansas. The bill includes three more Republicans among its 11 other sponsors. The other major measure dealing with campaign spend ing is sponsored by Senator John O. Pastore Democrat of Rhode Island, whose Senate Subcommittee on Communica tions will open hearings on the problem in about two weeks. The Pastore bill includes the measure that President Nixon vetoed and has two new fea tures: tax incentives of a $20 credit or a $100 deduction to encourage political contribu tions, and an extension of the limits on candidate spending to cover printed matter, as well as radio and television. The Gravel‐Pearson bill ap proaches the television prob lem by guaranteeing all candi dates free time, in addition to limiting the amount any one of them can spend for commercial telecasts. It would provide six half‐hours to each major party candidate for President and two to his running mate, and would authorize a study of similar treatment for Senate and House candidates. Senator Gravel is also spon soring a bill that goes consid erably further by providing for public underwriting of cam paigns, with national funds from which Presidential and Congressional candidates would receive 20 cents for every vote cast for the office they seek in the last election. To qualify, the candidates would have to open their financial records to a Federal commission. Lumping these various po litical provisions into a single bill raises a technical prob lem for Congress. The Pastore bill, for example, must be cleared by three Senate com mittees — Commerce, Rules and Finance — because it includes tax changes and disclosure re quirements as well as new lim its on communications media. Some members of Congress want to go beyond these pro posals. They would enact rela tively low dollar ceilings for all Senate and House races, prohibit the use of television “spots” as misleading and fi nance mailings and television time for all candidates. In political terms, the Dem ocrats are anxious to put some limitation on the amount Mr. Nixon can spend on his re election campaign by present ing him with a bill he will have difficulty vetoing. The Administration is expected to seek a considerably less re strictive bill that would also he more acceptable to mem bers of Congress reluctant to accept curbs on their own cam paign spending.

617-> House Rejects Nixon Bill On School Desegregation
WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 — The House of Representatives rejected today the Nixon ad ministration bill that seeks spe cial Federal financial help for communities that are desegre gating their schools. Under a procedure that pro hibited amendments and re quired a two‐thirds majority for Passage, nearly two‐thirds of those voting went against the bill. The vote was 222 to 135. The measure will come up again Wednasday, or Thursday, When it Can be amended and passed by a simple majority. Although the bill will stand a better chance of adoption then, some White House lobbyists who had been working for the bill were discoraged by to day's overwhelming vote. They had hoped that they could at least muster a majority in fa vor of the bill today. “It's going to be hard to get up enthusiasm after a vote like this,” one of these officials said. Elliot L. Richardson, Secretary of Health, Education and Wel fare, was more optimistic, how ever. He said that he was “con fident” that the House would be able to amend the bill later in the week in a way that would make it acceptable to most Rep resentatives. Representative Roman C. Pu cinski, Democrat of Illinois, chief sponsor of the measure, agreed. The key amendment to be of fered would prohibit the use of the funds in the bill to pay for busing children to schools out of their neighborhoods. Supporters of the legislation argued today that the bill did not require any community to bus schoolchildren as a condi tion for receiving part of the $1.5‐billion that the measure would authorize. But one of the leading op ponents, Representative John M. Ashbrook, Republican of Ohio, said, “Of course, the bill doesn't require busing, but it encourages busing. You decide if you want to be on record as encouraging busing.” The bill, originally proposed by President Nixon early last year, was passed by the Senate this spring and approved by the House Education and La bor Committee last month. It had not been brought to the House floor for a vote because the Rules Committee, headed by William M. Colmer, a con servative Mississippi Democrat, had refused to clear it. The measure was brought up today by Speaker Carl Albert under a procedure called “sus pension of the rules.” Under this procedure, debate is limit ed to 40 minutes, no amend ments are permitted and a two‐thirds majority is neces sary for passage. Usually, only noncontrover sial legislation is considered this way, and many House members objected to a “gag rule” on such an important bill. “I abhor the procedure that is being used to bring the bill to the floor,” said Representa tive John N. Erlenborn, an Il linois Republican. “I will vote against the bill today. I believe the funds should be available, but I think the whole issue of busing ought to be heard in a regular manner.” Later in the week, the deseg regation aid measure will be offered as an amendment to the Higher Education Bill, which is scheduled for a vote Wednesday. Sponsors of the measure have received assur ances from the parliamentarian, Lewis Deschler, that the amend ment is “germane.” Nearly every Southern Rep resentative voted against the bill today, but many of them are expected to support it if the amendment to prohibit the use of the money for busing is adopted. The White House is behind the antibusing amendment, and few House members doubt that it will pass.

618-> Iceland's New Leftist Cabinet Pursues Independent Policies
REYKJAVIK, Iceland, July 24 (Reuters)—Iceland's new leftist Government has devised an independent‐minded pro gram that has already had an impact abroad. The day after the coalition Cabinet was formed July 13, it declared that it would widen fishing limits to 50 miles from the present 12 next year and would phase out an American run air base at Keflavik over a four‐year period. The base is manned by 8,700 Americans for the North Atlan tic Treaty Organization. The Government said it would re main in NATO. The extension of the fishing limits has broad national sup port in an island nation heavily dependent on fishing resources, but the opposition is expected to put up a stiff fight over the move to close the base. Other goals of the Govern ment's ambitious program in clude tax reform, reorganiza tion of banking, insurance and manufacturing, 20 per cent wage increases, a shorter work week, higher pensions, more housing and more shipbuilding. Critics were quick to stress that there was no indication where the money would come from. They also predicted fric tion in the Government. The coalition, made up of Premier Olafur Johannesson's Progressive Farmers party, the Communists and the Liberal and Leftists Union, a Communist splinter group, was formed a month after elections swept out a coalition of the conserva tive Independence and Social Democratic parties. It had gov erned this North Atlantic na tion of 200,000 people for 12 years. A voter swing to the far left put the new Government in power. The Communists gained three seats for a total of 10, and the Liberal and Leftists Union gained two for a total of five. The coalition has 32 of the 60 seats in the Althing (Parliament). The Government has said that its most important mis sion is the extension of the fishing limits, set for Sept. 1, 1972. Likely to be popular domestically, it reflects wide‐ spread worry over the deple tion of the fish population by foreign fleets using intensive modern techniques. How leftist the coalition's policy will turn out to be is problematic. The main group, the Pro gressive Farmers, is considered moderate and is greatly con cerned with safeguarding trade, its bulwark being the Union of Icelandic Cooperatives, the country's biggest trading or ganization. However, the party is divided into two wings, and observers believe the party leaders agreed to join the coal ition to guard against the loss of younger, more leftist mem bers.

620-> Income Tax Stirs Outcry Throughout Connecticut
HARTFORD, July 24 — The Connecticut state income tax, which slipped through the Gen eral Assembly in the early hours of July 1, has provoked the big gest political storm in the state's history. When Connecticut residents went to sleep on the night of June 30, they knew that their legislators were grappling with a complex package of taxes, including an increase in the sales tax. When they woke up the next morning — after a surprising series of maneuvers, turnabouts and broken alliances in the gold‐domed Capitol building in Hartford — they could not be lieve the news. The outcry has not stopped since. A week after it was passed, the bill lapsed into law when Gov. Thomas J. Meskill, a con servative Republican who had been at loggerheads with the Democratic‐controlled General Assembly over a fiscal pro gram, refused to veto it. In what he termed a “silent pro test,” he said that he did not like the bill but had no other “viable alternative.” Two weeks later, the Gov ernor and the Democratic lead ers emerged from a brief meet ing to say that they would reconvene the General Assem bly on Aug. 5 to consider re pealing the income tax. Legislators are openly stunned by the protest, even though public‐opinion polls had shown an income tax to be an unpala table solution to the state's snarled fiscal affairs. First came the phone calls, then the newspaper editorials, then the talk shows, the peti tions and demonstrations. A New Haven Representative who favored the bill was forced to install a telephone device to relieve him of ob scene and threatening calls. An Ansonia Representative who opposed it found for the first time that the newspapers were printing a photograph of him with his new hairpiece. When Governor Meskill, who Democratic leaders charged had secretly lobbied for the tax, stepped up to home plate at Yankee Stadium during “Connecticut night,” he was roundly booed. “It's the violence of the re action that's upsetting,” one Representative confided. “I can't go home because of my phone. I'm afraid to go to the postoffice to pick up my mail. I can't even go to work any more.” While some of the income tax supporters insist on hoping for a modification of the tax, they are aware that their lead ers are currently drawing up a new package that eliminates it. The new package, which centers on an increase in the sales tax from 5 per cent to per cent and on a 10 per cent tax on capital gains and divid ends, is similar to a compro mise agreed upon by the Gov ernor and the Democratic leaders after weeks of haggling. It was this plan that was scuttled in the early hours of July 1 as a measure known as House Bill 9510 underwent a curious eight‐hour journey that transformed it into what The New Haven Register termed “the dagger in the night.” Although Gov. Chester Bowles had unsuccessfully proposed an income tax in 1949, the idea grew to become an anathema to the subsequent Democratic administrations of Abraham A. Ribicoff and John N. Dempsey. John M. Bailey, then at the peak of his power as the party's state chairman, contributed to the lore that the state's Yankee character — Connecticut had even refused to ratify the United States Constitutional amendment for a Federal in come tax—surely would not accept a similar levy close to home. During these same years, however, state government ex panded at an unprecedented rate and there was no commen surate tax increase to carry the costs of welfare and high er education. The state's defi cit reached $250‐million this year. A group of liberal educators, tied to labor, universities and urban areas, began a drive for an income tax as “more equit able” than the sales tax, which had been introduced as a tem porary measure for veterans' bonuses following World War II. The drive resulted in an abortive legislative revolt in the 1969 session by “young Turks,” who were silenced with the argument that an income tax would cause the state to lose its competitive edge in bidding for wealthy corporations from neighboring states. In his recent campaign Gover nor Meskill played down the in come tax as “a last resort.” But shortly after he took office, a bipartisan state revenue task force recommended it as the only viable alternative. Mr. Meskill then began a series of meetings with a hand ful of top legislators at the executive mansion. The group agreed to an income tax in May and was to announce it during a joint, bipartisan news con ference. “The Governor said we were all going to jump in holding hands,” recalled Carl Ajello, the Democratic majority leader in the House of Representa tions. But the plan failed when J. Edward Caldwell, Senate maj ority leader, withdrew his sup port. Mr. Caldwell, the town chairman of Bridgeport, who is saddled with a Democratic mayor who has increased local taxes, wanted assurances that the entire Bridgeport delegation would favor the Income tax. The Republican slated to run for mayor, Nicholas Panuzio, refused. Democratic leaders now charge that the Governor was guiding those early negotia tions toward the tax, to fulfill his announced goal of cutting the deficit at a time when it could be laid to the spending of the Democratic administra tion that preceded him. He backed off somewhat for the reported reason that his Re publican supporters, especially in Fairfield County, were grow ing upset. The Governor said this was not so. An intensive month of tug of‐war followed. The Demo crats pushed through two fis cal programs with a capital‐ gains tax. One was vetoed by the Governor on adjournment day, necessitating a special session, and one died under the threat of a veto. Three days before the be ginning of the new fiscal year on July 1—under threats by the Governor that he would have to order paycuts for state employes if there was no budg et by that date—the compro mise was reached that was to become House Bill 9510. In addition to the sales‐tax increase and the capital‐gains tax, it contained a plethora of minor taxes and exemption eliminations that angered special‐interest groups, from commuters to bankers to ad vertisers. Their lobbyists began to buttonhole legislators re lentlessly. The provision that provoked the strongest reaction was one calling for a 10 per cent luxury tax. Retailers across the state complained that, combined with the 6 per cent sales tax, it would drive consumers over the border to Massachusetts and even New York. Still, as the Democrats caucused on the morning of June 30, the compromise seemed secure. There was a nascent drive for an income tax in the Senate, where nine Re publicans had earlier drafted a statement supporting such a tax, but no one believed it could command a majority. Then, as the debate in the or nate House of Representatives chamber continued into the aft ernoon, the compromise fell apart. John Papandrea, a Dem ocratic leader from Meriden, home of the Silver International Company, announced that he could not support a luxury tax. A bargain was struck has tily in the corridors between Mr. Ajello, the Democratic ma jority leader, and Brian Gaff ney, the Republican state chair man. It was to substitute a tax on meals under a dollar to fill up the $8‐million hole. But the powerful Speaker of the House, William Ratchford, would not go along. When the luxury tax lost, and the meal tax did not win, Mr. Gaffney shouted an grily: “All agreements are off!” After a dinner recess, a patched‐up bill—now with an unincorporated business tax— was sent to the upper chamber. But by now the Republican in come‐tax proponents had per suaded nine Democrats to agree to a hastily drafted 90‐page bill. Since a death had reduced the Senate to only 35 members, the 18 votes represented a ma jority—of one. When the vote became as sured, three other Senators switched. Among them was the gray‐haired, dignified Senator from Greenwich, Florence Fin ney, whose wealthy constitu ents had complained about the capital‐gains tax in the other package. House members, cramming into the sweltering Senate chamber, were stunned by the 23‐to‐12 vote. Anti‐income tax forces attempted to force an adjournment until later in the day. It was defeated, and after midnight the bill was carried by messenger to the chamber where it had originated. By now, Mr. Gaffney, who is so closely allied with Governor Meskill that his vote is taken as an indication of the Gover nor's thinking, was actively campaigning for it. So also was Mr. Ratchford, who spoke from the floor as Speaker for the third time in state history. At 4 A.M. the vote was tal lied on the electronic board. The legislators gasped: 83 lights gleamed “yes” and 80 “no.” There was pandemonium. Mr. Ratchford said “the break‐ through has been made,” and lingered long enough to receive assurances from Mr. Gaffney that Mr. Meskill would not veto the bill. Soon, the gasp of the legis lators turned into an angry roar from the taxpayers, who began reading projected with‐ holding tax tables in the news papers. To cap their anger, they learned that most legislators had not read the bill and that it contained a blatant conflict as to its effective date—July 1, 1971, or Jan. 1, 1972. The reaction to the income tax has been unorganized, most people agree, and sprang spon taneously from middle‐income wage earners who bear the heaviest burden under the rate scale. While the law closes some loopholes favoring the wealthy, such as oil depletion allowances, the rates peak out at 6 per cent, plus $470, for incomes of $12,000 and more. “People in Connecticut prefer hidden taxes,” said Carl Alfano, president pro tem of the Senate who opposed the bill. “They feel they're paying voluntarily that way.”

621-> U.S. Woman Is Sentenced By Iran to 3‐Year Term
TEHERAN, Nov. 16 (UPI)— Miss Sharon La Bere, of Oakland, Calif., who admitted participating in anti‐Iranian demonstrations in the United States, was sentenced to three years in prison Sunday on a charge of having acted against the nation's security. Miss La Bere, who is 29 years old, denied the charge and appealed. She is being held in a women's prison pending the appeal. The military tribunal that handed down the sentence against Miss La Bere exonerated her on espionage charges. The Government said she was sent to Iran in September with funds from Iranian students in the United States to be used to get in touch with guerrillas. Miss La Bere said she took part in anti‐Iranian demonstrations in the United States because she sympathized with the political views of her Iranian fiance, All Akbar Vahedian.

622-> Helsinki and Moscow Back on Good Terms After Trouble Caused by Split Among Finnish Communists
HELSINKI, Finland, July 17 —Finland appears to be sail ing on calm waters again in her relations with her power ful neighbor, the Soviet Union, after half a year of difficulty. The trouble was brought on by quarreling Finnish Commu nists. Having split on ideological lines, the Communists created problems not only for them selves but for their partners on the far left in Parliament and for the constellation of parties that held power with them in Premier Ahti Karjalainen's Gov ernment. They also created problems for the Soviet Union. The Russians would like to see the Communists in Fin land at peace among them selves and participating in the Government. Last December, when the Communists were on the verge of being thrown out of Mr. Karjalainen's coalition, the So viet First Deputy Foreign Min ister, Vasily V. Kuznetsov, made a hurried secret visit to Helsinki in an unsuccessful attempt to mediate between the factions and keep the Pre mier from expelling the Com munists from the Government. The independent newspaper Helsingin Sanomat made pub lic some of the speculation about Mr. Kuznetsov's visit and reported that the Com munists would have to fall into line with the coalition's voting discipline because they had been “instructed from abroad” to remain in the Government. By the time the visit was acknowledged, the situation in Finnish politics and on the labor front was much worse. The country was deep in a six‐week spell of strikes in the construction and metal working industries, brought on by the minority of Communists who had refused to accept a Government decree removing some price controls. The Communist party chair man, Aarne Saarinen, was unable to control the rigid, doctrinaire, Stalinist minority. The Soviet Ambassador, Aleksei S. Belyakov, had been active in helping the Commu nists paper over their differ ences. After the Stalinists walked out of the party con gress in 1969, the Ambassador persuaded the more flexible Mr. Saarinen to let them back in again at the pre‐election congress in 1970. But the Stalinists forced the strikes in February and March, determined not to support price rises or any other eco nomic measures that would be unpopular with the workers. Ambassador Belyakov inter vened again, on the strike scenes and elsewhere. President Urho Kekkonen, who conducts foreign affairs with a firm personal grip in keeping with the Constitution, made a hurried trip to Moscow in February. He believes in keeping Com munists in the Government if possible, to help cement the good relations with the Soviet Union that he regards as vital to Finland's independence. But he is said to have made little ef fort to contain his anger over Mr. Belyakov's behavior and the political embarrassment it was causing him. The Ambas sador was withdrawn without announcement on Feb. 20. Premier Karjalainen resigned on March 17 and promptly formed a new coalition with out the 36 members of the People's Democratic League. The Russians waited for three months before replacing their envoy. Since the arrival of the new man, Viktor F. Maltshev, who was the Ambas sador in Stockholm, the diplo matic tension has cased considerably. However, the Finnish Com munists have not resolved their differences.

623-> From Ghetto to College
About 200 business end professional people in the New York area have been spending their leisure time getting inner‐city youngsters into college. They are part of an or ganization called Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, which finds motivated ghet to youth, usually with poor high school records, and tries to get them into college. The chairman of the or ganization is Michael Oshe owitz, 32 years old, of Ar thur Schmidt & Associates, a public relations firm. Mr. Osheowitz, whom one of his colleagues describes as hav ing “Kennedy looks,” found ed the organization six years ago, but the idea was con ceived in 1959 when he was attending Middlebury College in Vermont. Two of his classmates and co‐founders of the Sponsors organization were scholarship students horn and raised in New York ghettos. • The organization has an impressive record of suc cesses, with more than 400 students in college. Their dropout rate is 8 per cent, compared with a national average of 40 per cent. The program has graduated 30 students, most of whom are in graduate school or in mili tary service. The Sponsors organization is not a school, such as Harlem Prep, but a loose network of business and pro fessional people. While most of the activity is concentrat ed in New York, there are branches in Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles. Nationally a total of 250 people spon sor ghetto youngsters. The colleges that the youngsters have attended in clude Dartmouth, Columbia, Brown, Cornell, University of Pennsylvania, Vassar, Wesleyan, Middlebury and Bowdoin. Black colleges, mainly in the South — such as Howard, Florida A. & M. and Spelman, a women's school in Atlanta — are heavily represented. • The relationship between sponsor and student begins when the youth, generally a senior in high school, is starting to consider college. The sponsor and student col laborate on college applica tions and, once the student is enrolled, the pair usually stay in communication until the student is graduated. The sponsors contrib ute only their time and en ergy; all funds for scholar ships come from outside sources. The sponsors try to get college scholarships for their students, and the or ganization's own fund‐rais ing contributes an average grant of $400 a student. The organization's overhead is less than $200 a year. The youngsters who are now attending college, such as Louisa Procter, a fresh man at Bernard Baruch Col lege, feel that they could not have made it without the Sponsors organization. Miss Procter's sponsor is Karen Fenster, a former research er at Standard Oil (New Jer sey). Another researcher there, Fern Gold, is sponsor ing Pat Malone, a senior at Central Commercial High School in Manhattan. Miss Malone, who hopes to attend Boston University this fall., feels certain that the organi zation will get her into a college that otherwise would have been unattainable. Not all attempts to gain admittance are successful, and irr such a case the spon sor and student keep trying. Larry Mason, 19, a fresh man at York College in Bayside, Queens, wanted to attend a state university last fall. But, according to his sponsor, Richard Kameros, an Esso International division manager, “Larry's record in high school was pretty grim.” The student, who went to George Washington High School, is applying for a transfer this fall. He and his sponsor have been working together for one year, and the youth says that, even if he doesn't get into the col lege lie wants, the Sponsors organization has given him a better idea of what he would like to do. Sponsors include employes of such Wall Street firms as Faulkner, Dawkins & Sul livan; Bear, Stearns & Co., and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. Stand ard Oil (New Jersey) has the largest representation, with 12 employes, two employes' wives and four former em ployes. Another well repre sented company is Lybrand Ross Bros. & Montgomery, the accounting firm. Some firms have supple mented their employes' ef forts by giving the students jobs and financial support. Goldman, Sachs & Co. paid for a recent magazine adver tisement for the organiza tion. Lybrand, Jersey Stand ard and J. Walter Thompson each have supplied summer jobs to nearly a dozen stu dents. In finding a job for his student in his firm or a re lated one, the sponsor may be hoping to interest the youth in his own field. There are five general areas from which sponsors come: the business community, ad vertising, accounting, Wall Street and, in Los Angeles, the film and television in dustry. However, while some grad uates have gone on to busi ness school, most of the or ganization's students show a preference for such areas as meslicine or teaching, ac cording to Mr. Osheowitz. “There was never a trend toward business in the black community,” Mr. Osheowitz said. “We do get a large number interested in busi ness and black capitalism, but some think it's a cop out. Many kids feel that working on Wall Street is selling out to the white world. Civil rights has com pletely bypassed Wall Street much more than the other professions.”

624-> The World
“I swallowed my tears and voted for President Park,” 70‐year‐old Yun Kwan Ho said last week after casting his ballot in South Korea's seventh Presidential election. “We Kor ean people earnestly desire a peaceful transition of power, but I know that if we elected Mr. Kim Dae Jung [the opposition candidate], the Government would never allow him to come to power.” That is one view, and an ex treme one, of why austere, straight‐backed President Chung Hee Park, whose every face muscle resembles a tightly knot ted cord, defeated the flamboy ant and youthful Mr. Kim by more than 900,000 votes. But it contains a kernel of truth. Voter after voter interviewed before, during and after the election confessed that he would mark, or had marked, his ballot for Mr. Park without enthusiasm. All of them had misgivings, in greater or lesser degree, about allowing one man to stay in office so long. But many were afraid that Mr. Kim's election would mean instability and a possible army coup. The 45‐year‐old Mr. Kim hails from Makpo, a picturesque port in South Korea's traditionally neglected southwestern corner. A handsome man who speaks with deep voice and wide, com pelling gestures, Mr. Kim drew enthusiastic crowds during a six‐month campaign in which he sometimes covered 300 miles a day. Mr. Kim hammered at the twin themes of “Time for a Change” and “Root Out Corrup tion,” saying that President Park, if re‐elected, would “bury” democracy by installing a “gen eralissmo system.” On the positive side, Mr. Kim promised to install a dual price system for rice; under this plan, the Government would buy rice from farmers at a high fixed figure and sell it to consumers at a subsidized cheaper price. Internationally, he advocated that four powers — the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and Japan—guarantee the security of both North and South Korea. President Park is a former soldier who overturned the country's elected Government in a bloodless coup in 1960. After ruling for two years as chair man of a military junta, he turned civilian and was elected President under a new consti tution allowing him to serve two four‐year terms. This constitu tion was amended by referen dum in 1969 to permit Mr. Park to serve three consecutive terms. He has publicly pledged that his forthcoming term is his final one. The President's sincerity and personal honesty are generally acknowledged; however, unlike Mr. Kim, he lectures his audi ences like a stern schoolmaster, seldom if ever unbending. Voter Yun's fear of an upheaval or a military takeover if Mr. Kim won is understandable, for President Park's power rests solidly upon his control over the 600,000‐ man armed forces; over the bu reaucracy, including the South Korean Central Intelligence Agency, and over the machin ery of the ruling Democratic Republican party, which has branches down to the village level. Voter after voter said that Mr. Kim's arguments appealed to them. “He scratched our itchy places,” as one man put it. The idea of a four‐power guarantee for Korea's security went over the heads of most ordinary citizens. But Mr. Kim's promises to abolish the two‐mil lion‐man Home Guard and the much‐disliked Korean C.I.A. were warmly received by young er voters, especially those tired of stale military confrontations with North Korea and resentful of the C.I.A.'s combining intel ligence‐gathering with press censorship, domestic political manipulations and political ar rests. Mr. Kim's defeat means that the more‐imaginative attitude he advocated toward the North Korean regime of Marshal Kim II Sung will not become South Korean foreign policy for at least another four years. But even the stern Mr. Park recog nizes the multipolarity of the Communist world and the tend ency of each Communist power to seek its own accommodation with the Western world. While emphasizing the con tinuing bellicosity of the Kim 11 Sung regime, President Park has said that, if South Korea stands firm, North Korea even tually may moderate its stand. In an unusual playful inter change with newsmen, the Pres ident suggested that some time after 1975 the two Koreas could cooperate to develop the famous Diamond Mountains, just north of the 38th Parallel, as a tourist attraction.

625-> THE WEEK IN FINANCE
LMOST all the background news last week was decidedly constructive, but the stock market failed to take heart from it and instead endured a mild period of consolidation. Little of Wall Street's rampant optimism was doused, however. The financial community continues to display a thoroughly confident mood based on the general pickup in the economy, the relative cheapness and availability of credit and the improving trend of corporate earnings. The stock market seesawed during the last week and ended only slightly depressed after some rather active trading. It touched a 23‐month high in the Dow‐Jones average before easing downward toward the weekend. In closing at the 941 level, the Dow indicator showed a net loss of just 6 points for the week but a strong gain of more than 37 points for the month of April. • • • In addition to the bright glow of corporate profit reports, last week produced such normally bullish devel opments as the fifth consecutive monthly rise in the leading economic indicators; a 6 per cent advance in construction contracts for the latest month; a slight improvement in the nation's trade surplus, and new gains in retail sales. There was also some further optimistic commentary on the state of the economy from top Administration officials as well as warnings about the danger of excessive wage and price increases. Most significant, perhaps, was the speech of Treasury Secretary John B. Connally Jr. in which he told business men that the proposed $3‐billion liberalization of deprecia tion regulations would go into effect, as scheduled, this year and that restoration of the investment tax credit, if requested, would be made retroactive to April 1, based on assurances from leading members of tax‐writing com mittees in Congress. • • • The obvious objective was to prod businessmen into greater capital‐spending projects this year to aid the economy and help reduce joblessness. However, the business world remains quite conserva tive in its capital‐spending plans for 1971, although prospects for later years are better. The annual McGraw Hill survey on business plans for new plants and equip ment last week projected a 4 per cent increase in such outlays this year to $82.8‐billion. That represented a small improvement since last fall, when a survey indicated only a 2 per cent gain. However, higher outlays for the next three years were projected—up to almost $91‐ billion in 1974. Although the tempo of business in April seemed to slow down slightly from the fast pace set in the first quarter, the economy is still pointed on an upward course, even without much stimulation from capital and defense spending, and inflation is definitely waning. The major problems continuing to nag the Administra tion are the stubbornly high level of unemployment and the need for greater consumer spending. Getting the unemployment rate down from the 6 per cent area to a more acceptable level will be, as one high Administra tion put it, a “real tough nut to crack.” • • • If the weekly trend of The New York Times business index proves to be a reliable indicator, economic sta tistics for April upcoming in the next two weeks should show’ less favorable overtones. The Times's combined index declined from 376.3 in the week ended March 27 to 355.8 in the week ended April 24. The major factor was a large drop in electric power production. What has not been generally realized is the likelihood that the economy's course this year might turn out to be quite erratic, even if it does soar upward toward the Administration's gross national product target of $1,065‐ billion, which may, of course, turn out of be excessively ambitious. The first quarter was strong on auto catch‐up activity and the start of steel hedge‐buying. The second quarter may also be quite buoyant with steel stockpiling still under way. However, the third quarter should be slow because of either a steel strike or high‐level inventories of the metal that have to be worked off. But then the fourth quarter should wind up the year on a strong upbeat. While retail business remains encouraging and housing activity still shows a vigorous expansion as the two principal stimulants for the economy, auto sales have recently tapered off a bit, and the public has indicated some apprehension over income and job prospects, which has had an impact on spending plans. The latest report from the Department of Commerce disclosed that retail sales across the nation had main tained a fast pace in the week ended April 24. The latest gain was a highly satisfactory 7 per cent, making volume for the last two months significantly better than a year ago. Without question, the most favorable news of the week from the stock market's standpoint involved the sur prisingly strong showing of first‐quarter corporate earnings. • • • With General Motors, as expected, leading the way, many corporations bounced back from the profit squeeze of 1970 and posted good gains in the latest quarter. General Motors, of course, benefited from the catch‐up demand for cars carried over from its strike period late last year, and the steel companies experienced a business surge from customer hedge‐buying against the possibility of a steel strike this summer. In many other cases, however, the better profits reflected the general economic recovery that has been under way since late in 1970 and as a result of the cost cutting programs that were adopted during 1969 and 1970 to combat the recession and the intensifying pres sures of cost‐push inflation. The General Motors report was the most spectacular the week. The giant automotive manufacturer disclosed that earnings had soared 75 per cent over the year‐ago period to $610‐million as sales jumped 39 per cent $7.8‐billion. Unit and dollar sales set quarterly records, while the net profit was the third highest in the com pany's history. Other impressive earnings included the gains of 14.7 per cent realized by United States Steel, the 17 per cent gain of Bethlehem, the 37 per cent increase of Ford, the 15 per cent rise of Texaco and the 12.4 per cent gain chalked up by International Telephone & Telegraph. On the adverse side, however, were the declines in profits registered by companies such as Eastman Kodak (18 per cent), Republic Steel (29 per cent), and Cities Service (10.9 per cent). There were also some sizable deficits incurred by United Air Lines and Pan American. A tabulation of 1,100 companies showed an increase 10.35 per cent in net profits for the first quarter over the similar period in 1970. Their aggregate earnings totaled $6.4‐billion, compared with $5.8‐billion last year. About half of the rise was accounted for by the big gain achieved by General Motors. On the adverse side, however, were the declines in profits registered by companies such as Eastman Kodak (18 per cent), Republic Steel (29 per cent), and Cities Service (10.9 per cent). There were also some sizable deficits incurred by United Air Lines and Pan American.

Their aggregate earnings totaled $6.4‐billion, compared with $5.8‐billion last year. About half of the rise was accounted for by the big gain achieved by General Motors. Interest rates continued to move upward last week and bond prices declined—to the consternation of Wall Street's bond experts. • • • Prices of corporate bonds were sliding, with yields climbing, and so were those on municipals. The Bond Buyer index—a key measure of yields on tax‐exempt state and city bonds—jumped 21/100ths of a percentage point last week to 5.69 per cent. As a result, local govern ment borrowing costs, after rising for six consecutive weeks, are now at their highest level since early January. The rise in other rates came although the Treasury did not include a long‐term bond in its plans to refinance $8.44‐billion of notes that come due on May 15. Aware of the weakness in the capital and money markets for the last month that has caused interest rates to climb sharply, the Treasury wanted to make sure that it did not drive rates even higher. Bond analysts are at a loss to explain the pronounced drive toward higher interest rates this spring. In view of the expected diminution of bond sales this year and the more favorable behavior of the consumer price index, interest rates should not be rising so sharply. However, investors have felt they can demand higher yields since the near‐term calendar of bond sales heavy and the economic indicators point to a stronger recovery later this year. Moreover most leading com mercial banks were able to lift their prime rate by quarter‐point to 5½ per cent a week ago even though their loan demand remains soggy. For the last five and one‐half years investors have been rewarded if they have waited for higher yields. Now they are holding back once again in the belief that demand for long‐term funds will remain strong. This investor psychology must have disappointed the Treasury's debt managers, who gave up a chance to put the national debt into more manageable form. The stock market again last week was a thoroughly mixed affair, with all the averages showing modest losses, in the fourth heaviest weekly trading in the history the New York Stock Exchange. • • • There were 882 issues that lost ground, 788 that advanced and 160 that closed with no net change for the week. The Dow‐Jones industrial stock average declined 6.04 points to 941.75; The New York Times combined average was down 3.91 to 550.11: the Standard & Poor's 500‐stock index eased 0.10 to 103.95, and the Stock Exchange composite slipped 0.05 to 57.27. Turnover on the Big Board increased to 102.7 million shares from 92 million the week before. Volume also picked up on the American Exchange to 31.4 million shares from 25.7 million the week before, while the exchange's price index eased 0.04 to 26.17.

626-> Seriously, Why Not Statehood for the City?
If a Broadway opening got the kind of reviews that have greeted the re cently opened campaign for New York City statehood, the show would close on Saturday night. Consider just the following critical excerpts: “An idea whose time has passed.”— Donna Shalala in a report for the Citizens Union. “A lousy idea whose time seems to have come.”—Richard Reeves in The Saturday Review. “An idea whose time never was.”— New York Times. “Utterly unrealistic … absurdity.” —Governor Rockefeller. “Fraudulent … irresponsible … hoax … rigidifying existing gov ernmental fragmentation.”—New York State division of the budget. It's hard to escape the conclusion that the professional critics are so busy trying to write a line to outdo their colleagues' rhetoric that they have no time to listen to the facts. There are three important ones: (1) The city contributes hundreds of millions more in state revenues each year than it gets back in cash aid and state services. In a word, the city is shortchanged by Albany. (2) The city cannot impose a new tax, write a tougher rent control law, reorganize its police platoons or sign a contract with its own employes with out the State Legislature's seal of ap proval. In brief, the city needs more home rule. (3) Statehood is the only course that gives the people of New York City the power to do something themselves about these facts—instead of putting their faith in the doubtful benevolence of Albany and the Federal establish ment in Washington. It now appears that statehood will not likely be an issue on the ballot on election day. But whatever the out come of this year's campaign, these facts will not go away of their own accord. Virtually all of the state's tax rev enues are spent in one of two ways: through the local assistance fund, which provides direct payments for things like education (to school dis tricts) and welfare (to counties); or through the state purposes fund, which goes to institutions ranging from the State University to mental hospitals and prisons. Estimates of the city's contribution to state revenues range up to 50 per cent. The state division of the budget concedes that the city generates at least 45 per cent of the state's taxes. Yet the city gets back less than 43 per cent of the money in the local assist ance fund, and a mere 33 per cent of the state purposes fund. The antistatehood camp argues that the share of state taxes paid by the city has been getting smaller, while the city's portion of the state‐aid pie has been growing. In other words, our subsidy to the state isn't as flagrant as it used to be. But it's still there, and there's no assurance whatever that it will continue to shrink—especially when the State Legislature can cut state aid as it did this year. Critics of the statehood option have another technique for dodging these implications. They contend—correctly, on the whole—that it would be expen sive for a new state to take over services now provided by Albany. Con troller Abraham Beame, for example, has said that the city‐state “would have to buy up all the state's property here, and it would have to add perhaps as many as 35,000 more people to its payroll.” But these costs must be weighed against the disproportionate amount the city pays now for state services. The cost of acquiring state property would be financed by borrowing in any case, and would be spread over many years. If the state set the price too high, the city‐state could build its own facilities and leave Albany with a lot of empty offices on its hands. As for those hypothetical 35,000 new city em ployes, it might be interesting to know how many state employes' salaries the city's taxes are paying for now. The contention that the city would be, worse off financially as a new state is just not supported by anything other than the shakiest of projections. Yet even that wobbly base is lacking for an antistatehood position. No one doubts that statehood would give the city a tremendous boost in the one place where a boost is needed even more than in the pocketbook: namely, the ego. There's a striking similarity among the views of statehood critics on just what we need to get us out of the mess our city is in. A Citizens Union staff report recommends “a completely re designed governmental system for the entire metropolitan area that combines centralization and decentralization.” A Times editorial writer calls for “much closer integration with the rest of the metropolitan region.” Mr. Beame wants to restructure “all levels of govern ment—Federal, state, region, county, city, community district, town and village.” Fine sentiments, these—no doubt about it. But the question is: How do we get there from here? Certainly the counties, towns, villages and what not have their problems. And most of them are unalterably convinced that by add ing our city's problems to their own, they would simply be asking for very bad trouble. So far, I've heard no proposal other than city‐statehood that permits the city to take the Initiative. As a state, we can decide for ourselves whether to abolish the subway fare or raise it to a dollar. We'll be able to tailor our taxes to our needs, not Albany's. And if the drawbridges are left open or the gar bage isn't picked up, we'll know who to blame.

628-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: Your Jan. 24 editorial argues that, given goodwill between the powers, some of them (unspecified) ought to be able to keep peace between Israel and neighboring states by interposing inter national peace forces. It is equally true that given goodwill the Arabs and Israel ought to be able to maintain peaceful relations between themselves, which certainly would be preferable. But the fact is that goodwill be tween whatever powers you have in mind, exactly like goodwill between Israel and the Arabs, depends in this case on a clear understanding of the limits beyond which each dare not push its own self‐interest for fear of the others. Only when these limits are clearly defined and understood can the present conflict end and true, disinter ested goodwill have a chance to thrive. It is a very debatable point whether hostility between Jews and Arabs or third‐power rivalries have more to do with the current Middle East crisis. But there can be no question that third‐power involvement, directly or through manipulating the United Na tions, has in the past prevented and not advanced understanding between Israel and the Arabs of the limits essential to their coexistence. Whatever your own intent, your proposal in effect strengthens the illu sion that Israel may yet be safely liquidated. What is possibly more significant in terms of American interests is that it also fortifies the effort to impose on the Middle East a solution parallel to the disastrous international control commission for Laos. Surely we have had enough of that. Americans should have learned in Southeast Asia that—at any rate in the area free of the recognized domination of one of the superpowers in our Two ‐ World world — local situations must be resolved by local forces. The only peace we can count on in the free world is peace locally sustained and accepted. If international forces have a role to play in the Middle East, it cannot be to keep Arabs and Jews from facing each others' existence directly and accepting the necessary conclusions. It can only be to separate third powers and facilitate their withdrawal and the general reduction of the threat to world peace which an overactive for eign presence represents.

631-> Ex‐Student at Kent Makes Guilty Plea On Rioting Charge
RAVENNA, Ohio, Dec. 1 (UPI) —Larry Shub, a former Kent State University student, pleaded guilty today to firstdegree riot charges growing out of the 1970 campus disorders at the school, where four students were killed by Ohio National Guardsmen. Mr. Shub, 20 years old, of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, was the third of 25 persons indicted by a Portage County grand jury to be tried on charges stemming from the disturbances, which began May 2, 1970, and culminated two days later when the students were shot to death. Jerry Rupe, 23 of Ravenna, the first person to he tried, was convicted yesterday of interfering with a fireman after the campus Reserve Officers Training Corps building was set on fire May 2. Charges against Peter C. Bliek, 23, of Rochester, N. Y., were dropped because of a lack of evidence. After Mr. Shub pleaded guilty, the prosecution said it would ask dismissal of two other charges against him second degree riot and attempting to .burn a campus building. The defense asked Judge Edwin Jones to place Mr. Shub on probation. Judge Jones referred the matter to the Portage County Adult Probation Department. Charges of first degree riot can be considered either a misdemeanor or a felony, a decision that will be made by Judge Jones. Under a misdemeanor, Mr. Shub could be fined up to $1,000 and sentenced to one year in jail, or both. If a felony, Mr. Shub could receive not less than one year and not more than three years in prison.

635-> Presidential Seal to Get Workout on Nixon Trips
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1—The White House is already worrying about an eight‐ounce object made of plaster of paris that may never be seen on Chinese soil but will fly there ahead of President Nixon when he visits China in February. Meantime, it will get a dizzying workout during the months to come as Mr. Nixon goes to meetings with President Pompidou of France in the Azores; Prime Minister Heath of Britain in Bermuda; Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany at Key Biscayne, Fla.; Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau of Canada in Washington and Premier Eisaku Sato of Japan at San Clemente, Calif. The object is the Presidential seal, symbol of authority and office, and it goes everywhere with the President, “just like his socks and underwear,” said one White House watcher. The 10‐inch‐wide seal leapfrogs the Presidential jet in a giant C‐141 cargo plane half the length of a football field. The same plane carries the President's 150‐pound speech podium to which the seal will be fixed on arrival, his dark blue flag with its almost identical coat of arms, the Presidential automobile and the Secret Service backup car that follows him in motorcades. This portable equipment surrounds the President wherever he travels in this country and is always flown abroad. But it is often not displayed, especially if the host country wants to supply its own power symbols. Actually, there are six identical plaster of Paris seals kept at the White House by Signal Corpsmen. The reason is that the President, particularly in a campaign year, makes several or more speeches a day in widely separated spots to which the seals can be hauled direct from Washington. Lyndon B. Johnson's schedule was so hectic and so often not announced until the last minute that the seal detail frequently switched briefly from plaster to lighter, unbreakable papiermâché. But even then, the seal frequently failed to catch up with him. President Nixon, by contrast, “gives us a pretty good shake,” says Maj. Anthony Koppie, the man who keeps the seals. “He hasn't gotten ahead of us yet.” Some people have tried to snatch the seal on the road —“it would make a nice souvenir,” Major Koppie acknowledged—but failed. The design may be reproduced only if the President orders it. But so many unauthorized likenesses have been made, printed and otherwise reproduced that Congress passed a law this year forbidding any such use. It goes into effect next Jan. 5, carrying a fine of up to $250 or a six‐month jail sentence or both for each offense. In the Nixon Administration the seal can be seen as shoulder patches on White House police uniforms, blazer pockets of White House chauffeurs and the Presidential plane's crew, and tie clasps and cuff links for the President's personal use or for his staff. Various Presidents have also had it embedded in the White House in five places. Theodore Roosevelt put it into the floor of the great entrance hall, from which it was later moved to a spot over the door of the diplomatic reception room. Franklin D. Roosevelt had it set into the ceiling of the President's oval office and in the cornerstone of the East Wing. And Harry’ S. Truman had it embossed over the door of the Blue Room and of the Presidential bedroom during the large‐scale White House renovation completed in 1952. The eagle on two of these seals—in the 1903 version installed by Theodore Roosevelt and in the 1942 cornerstone — faces the wrong way: toward the arrows of war clutched in its left talon rather than toward the olive branch of peace in its right. So did a third eagle in the Presidential office ceiling until some time in President Johnson's Administration, when it was turned around. Wrong ‐ way seals were used by every President from Rutherford B. Hayes to Mr. Truman. President Hayes was the first known to have used a Presidential seal, having ordered it engraved on White House invitations in 1880. White House experts suspect the left ‐ facing eagle was picked either by mistake (according to heraldic custom, the eagle always faces its own right, the direction of honor), or to make it look different from the similar but not identical Great Seal of the United States. Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the design changed to conform with the rules and have the eagle face toward the symbol of peace on his flag, stationery and personal documents. The order was carried out by President Truman in October, 1945, after Mr. Roosevelt's death. The practice of carting a three ‐ dimensional, painted seal around wherever the President goes dates back at least to Mr. Truman: photographs of his 1948 whistle‐stop campaign in White House files show the seal on his train's back platform. Curiously, there is no Presidential seal that stamps official Presidential documents. This is done with the Great Seal of the United States, which is in the State Department's custody. The design of this seal was established by law on June 20, 1782. The Great Seal is locked behind glass in the department's exhibition hall. Periodically, Bernice C. Renn, keeper of the seal and chief of Presidential commissions, operates the precision press to stamp from 3,000 to 5,000 documents a year. She affixes the seal to commissions signed by the President installing Cabinet officers, ambassadors, officials of all independent government agencies and Presidential appointees to the Executive Office. Through individual warrants also signed by the President, the Great Seal is put on other documents such as Presidential national proclamations and instruments of ratifications of treaties. The front and reverse designs of the Great Seal appear on the backs of all one‐dollar bills. Only the eagle front is used to stamp Presidential documents; the die for the reverse, with its pyramid and all‐seeing eye, has never been cut, Mrs. Renn says.

637-> French Toehold
DETROIT—A large French international oil company, aided by 200 specially hired women established a beach head in Michigan a month ago in what could ultimately be an invasion of the United States petroleum market. This month 145 Detroitarea gasoline stations replaced their Standard Oil (Indiana) emblems with the decals and standards of Total Petroleum (North America) Ltd. of Canada. Total is 40 per cent owned by the Cornpagnie Frangaise des Petroles (C.F.P.), a private French company that has 23 refineries arolind the world and does business in 54 countries. Earlier the French company acquired a Michigan petroleum refinery and distributor, Leonard Refineries, of Alma. The 145 stations are owned by the Citrin Oil Company of Detroit, but for years they have been leased to independent service‐station operators, who sold Standard Oil products. As motorists drove into the Citrin stations on the morning of the changeover, April 1, a company of Kelly girls offered them five gallons of Total gasoline free if they would agree to sign for a Total credit card. Overnight, Standard Oil of Indiana, the nation's 18th largest oil company, lost more than 22 per cent of its outlets in metropolitan Detroit. Standard Oil sells an estimated 300 million gallons of gasoline a year in the Detroit area. A Standard Oil spokesman conceded that the 145 Citrin stations were a “substantial” number. He pointed out, however, that with 500 or more remaining stations, Standard Oil would “still be the largest distributor” in the Detroit metropolitan area. Total had not intended to enter the United States market so soon, said Citrin's president, Martin E. Citrin, a short, compact man in his forties. But “in the spring of 1970,” he said, Standard Oil management “indicated that they were going to discontinue supplying us with their products. “In examining. the options available, we found an exciting opportunity with a dynamic company for our dealers and our entire organization.” A Standard Oil of Indiana spokesman declined to offer an explanation for the break with Citrin. According to Mr. Citrin, however, it stemmed from so‐called dual distributorships. “There are very few dual distributorships left in the nation,” explained Mr. Citrin. “Maybe not more than a dozen.” Citrin was a dual distributorship in the Standard distribution system in the Detroit area, said an industry source, and “in today's mass marketing, Citrin just became an unnecessary middle man.” The Citrin‐Standard alliance goes back almost 50 years. When Standard first came to Detroit, according to the source, it found it convenient to use Citrin as its local distributor, or “jobber.” In the years that followed, Standard was distributing its products in the Detroit area in two ways: ¶Indirectly to Citrin‐owned, independently operated stations through Citrin as the “jobber.” ¶Directly to all other service stations selling Standard Oil products. Standard Oil's wholesale price to Citrin was below its wholesale price to the other stations selling its products. Other Investments The French foray into the American petroleum market, by way of its acquisition of Leonard Refineries of Alma, Mich, is only one of a growing number of direct investments by foreign concerns in United States subsidiaries. As recently as 1965, foreign direct investment In the United States was running at a rate of $100‐million a year compared with direct investment abroad by United States concerns of $2.2‐billion a year. Last year, however, foreign direct investment in the United States had grown to $880million a year, while United States direct investment abroad was running at $3.97‐billion. A Department of Commerce publication, Commerce Today, said recently that about 700 United States Companies now are owned by almost 500 foreign concerns. These companies represented an investment of about $12‐billion, compared with United States direct investment overseas about $70‐billion. Faced with the decision of Standard Oil to discontinue supplying the stations, Mr. Citrin said that he had the choice of going out of business or finding a new supplier. After nine months of indecision, the 50‐year‐old, family‐owned Citrin Company decided to become a part of Leonard Refineries, Inc., a subsidiary of Total. Leonard had few stations in the Detroit metropolitan area, where Citrin was strong. Citrin was acquired by Leonard in December last year. Total and its chief stockholder, C.F.P., arrived on the United States scene through some twists and turns. C.F.P. set up an American subsidiary, Total America, which bought 25 per cent of Leonard in 1966. This later grew to 38 per cent. In March, 1970, a Calgarybased production company, French Petroleum, reached agreement to acquire Leonard through an exchange of stock. C.F.P. owned 45 per cent of French Petroleum. When the Leonard‐French Petroleum merger was completed last October, French Petroleum changed its name to Total Petroleum (North America), Ltd., and Leonard became its wholly owned subsidiary. Leonard officials say that C.F.P. now owns about 40 per cent of Total. Trade sources, including some close to Leonard, say that Leonard's new owners plan eventually to market coast to coast in the United States. Leonard's president, S. D. Saboff, says such talk is “inaccurate,” adding that Total hopes to expand its marketing through Leonard —but not on a national scale, Even so, early this year Leonard made it known that it was “interested” in some 1,000 stations of Standard Oil of Ohio.

638-> The Devils’ Finds An Advocate
cable piece of art“—The Los Angeles Times. “…Morbid miasma … wanton violence …shameful carnality. …Its X rating is thoroughly deserved“—The Saturday Review. “…Might have been writteh and filmed by Nero and the Marquis de Sade”—Newsweek. Could any movie live up to this kind of advance publicity? People who come to see “The Devils” fresh from reading the reviews are in for a disap pointment. It really does not contain all the lurid, unspeakable thrills that the critics have described so breath lessly. Perhaps the devils of repression and fanaticism and hypocrisy that Ken Russell means to attack in his striking, abrasive film about a 17th‐century witch hunt are closer to the surface of con temporary life than most of us want to admit. “The Devils”, is an incredibly ambi tious film, conceived not simply as historical document but as a visionary work, a prophetic warning of the tenac ity of ignorance and superstition. The ideas in Russell's film may seem overly schematic, but his terrifying, fantastical nightmare images have astonishing psy chological power. In a characteristic sequence, Russell intercuts the devotion als of the repressed, neurotic Mother Superior, Sister Jeanne (a fine baroque performance by Vanessa Redgrave), with a blasphemous erotic fantasy in which she imagines herself licking the wounds of Christ; this counterpointing suddenly bares the masochistic sexuality implicit in the myth of the Crucifixion. Although he is a Catholic, Russell re fuses to be intimidated by official pieties. His audacity is what makes his work original; he breaks the rules of good taste, obliterates the tired na turalistic conventions that most film makers cling to. All of Russell's work, his BBC documentaries and his feature films, reveal a terror of physical and mental disintegration. In his films, death has shocking, visceral immediacy; his career can be seen as a continuing struggle to find an imaginative vision that will be powerful enough to ward off the terrible stench of decomposing flesh. In his television biographies of artists, and in his superb film “The Music Lovers,” the tranquility provided by art is only temporarily restorative. The artist flees death, but Russell believes in the necessity of confronting it. Even more mercilessly than his other works, “The Devils” dwells on physical and sexual realities — maggots circling the eye sockets of a rotting corpse, the sweat on the bodies of two lovers, the blistering of a man's face as he is burned to death—not because it is searching for sensational thrills but because it means to underscore the harshness of life, a vision of agony which any creative or spiritual quest must acknowledge. In the play “The Trial of the Ca tonsville Nine,” Daniel Berrigan ex plains what led to his radicalization: “I had understood the power of death in the modern world.” Grandier (Oliver Reed), the protagonist of “The Devils,” is a very different kind of radical priest, but he, too, insists on testing the ab stract teachings of the Church against a concrete awareness of death in his world. He understands the brutality of life around him, and he also under stands himself; he freely admits his love of women and power. Grandier's sen suality is a mockery of death, a rage against it. The film opens on a disorienting close‐up of painted waves in a two‐ dimensional sea, then after a moment the camera draws back to reveal that this is a stage set on which Louis XIII and sonic courtiers (all in drag) are set to perform their aims offbeat ver sion of the birth of Venus. The sequence calls our attention to theatri calperformance as one of the norms of 17th‐century life; this royal masque has a parallel in the later scenes of the public exorcisms, staged like a circus sideshow with the “possessed” nuns per forming obscene tricks for the masses. Against the artifice, the sham of world where performance and reality have become indistinguishable, Gran dices honesty and directness are high lighted. He might be a Lawrentian hero‐ — a man who embraces the truths of the body, and uses his apprehension of physical pain and pleasure as the basis of an unconventional but sincere religious faith. However, the sugges tion of Grandier's sainthood in the final scenes does seem slightly strained in a skeptical age, assertions of self‐trans cendence usually remain only assertions. It is as a secular hero that Grandier touches a modern imagination. Grandier is a political libertarian as well, as a libertine, and Richelieu wants him destroyed because he has succeeded in making Loudun an independent city State in a tyrannical, autocratic France. To represent Loudun, Russell has built it, magnificent set, almost futuristic; this imposing fortress of gleaming white brick is clearly no literal re‐creation of a. 17th‐century town but an embodi ment of creative possibilities — hallucinatory citadel of enlightenment and progress in the midst of ignorance and reaction. There are two basic approaches to historical material, both equally valid and legitimate: The artist may be in terested in the past for its own sake, which means he will depend on pains takingly researched reconstructions in order to educate us as to what actually happened (for example, Rossellini's “Rise of Louis XIV”); or he may want to use a historical situation as a point of departure for an abstracted symbolic picture of universal evils, a fresco that holds a special relevance for the present (for example, Fellini's “Satyricon”). The visual conception of Loudun and the characterization of Grandier sug gest that Ken Russell has chosen the second approach in “The Devils.” De liberate anachonisms (Louis's campy farewell to a dying Protestant, “Bye bye blackbird,” or the horribly miscon deived role of the quasi‐hippie exorcist Played by Michael Gothard) can only be justified as part of Russell's attempt ‘to’ jolt us out of the complacency that historical films often inspire, and force its to see “The Devils” as an allegory for time. But if the film is meant to be symbolic and visionary, then why is it necessary to dwell so lingeringly on the details of torture (the exorcism with giant syringe, the application of wasps and hornets to the nipples of a dying plague victim) peculiar to the distant past? Given Russell's interest in highly personal, metaphorical interpretations of history, we could accept inaccuracies more easily than the film's curious, slavish fidelity to gory details of 17th‐ century life. Dealing with the atrocities of the past is a very tricky esthetic problem, and it has defeated most film makers, whether their subject has been Attila the Hun, the Inquisition or the Nazi concentration camps. For unless we are confident that the artist is using these atrocities for an absolutely clear and compelling imaginative purpose, we begin to feel uncomfortable. A mere catalogue of ancient horrors is not illuminating. At times “The Devils” does seem unnecessarily cruel to the audi ence. There are other miscalculations in the film. Some inexplicably clumsy scenes may be attributable to studio in terference; Warner Brothers, terrified of the film, has trimmed several of the most graphic sequences, and that is why some of the transitions seem so awk ward and abrupt. But even granting that, Russell's staging is not always fluid. Working from a theatrical source (John Whiting's play) may have inhib ited him; some of the spectacular scenes are rather static tableaux, and the huge crowds in the public exorcism scenes seem to be out of his control. At the same time, the film gives Rus sell opportunities to reveal his range. Some of the very best scenes in “The Devils” are the simplest—the quiet scenes between Grandier and his secret wife Madeleine (Gemma Jones). They are filmed austerely, and Russell has worked through his actors to make them exceptionally powerful. Gemma Jones is lovely and touching, while Reed, in his best performance by far, creates a character of tremendous stature and dignity, one of the few convincingly heroic figures in recent movies. Ken Russell's detractors insist that his only forte is hysteria, but they should look at the scene in which Grandier and Madeleine debate the issue of priestly celibacy, which is witty and charming high comedy. Best of all is the very last scene, after Grandier has been burned and the town destroyed. While his ashes are being cleared away, Madeleine emerges from one of the buildings where she has been held captive. Heightening the sense of desolation, Russell drains the color from the image, and the last shot is in black and white: Still slightly dazed, Madeleine makes her way silently over the rubble of the demolished town walls, and out into the surrounding countryside, walking hesitantly but determinedly past the skeletons that line the road, It is one of the most del icate moments in all Russell's work, moving and indelible—a barely formed dream of liberation, a last tentative vision of the possibility of individual freedom even under the most oppres sive and monstrous conditions. Coming after all the scenes of frenzy and gro tesquerie, it is a strangely serene, pur gative conclusion. One may wish the film as a whole had had more emotional tension; “The Devils” is admittedly uneven, seriously flawed, but it is filled with the energy passion and imagination that make Ken Russell one of the most exciting and important filmmakers working today.

To the Financial Editor The proposed use of $250million of public funds in aid of the shareholders of the Lockheed Corporation, if accomplished, will surely be a benchmark in grand‐scale welfare aid for those who have undertaken otherwise unprofitable risks of the market place. No one objects to public support of an effort essential to the national interest when that aid goes directly to the purpose rather than to the corporate financial structure —as in the Rolls‐Royce and Penn Central situations.

Announcer: “Perhaps we did shade the truth a little and tell you that our mouse trap was smoother working, quieter and more effective than any other mousetrap in its price range, and we are indeed sorry if we misled any of you. The trouble is we had this copywriter at our agen cy who couldn't think of any thing new to say about mousetraps, and so he lied. Anyway, we all know that all mousetraps do pretty much the same, but please do come and look at ours.” Announcer: “You know and we know that all aspi rins are the same and are the acetate of salicylic acid. We are sorry if we made you believe otherwise, but go to your drugstore and see if you don't think that we have the prettiest package.” Are these the sounds of advertising in the nineteen seventies? Quite possibly. The threat of ever‐tighter Government regulation of ad vertising is becoming greater with every passing day. Spurred by consumer groups, Federal Government agencies are proposing regulations and creating case law at an un precedented rate. The penalties for “false and deceptive” advertising have long passed the “slap on the wrist” stage and are now of serious consequence to adver tisers and their agencies. In recent cases, the Fed eral Trade Commission has shown its muscle by seeking to obtain orders against ad vertisers under which future advertising would have to contain an admission of prior wrongdoing. For instance, in a proposed complaint against the Coca Cola Company and its adver tising agency, the Marschalk Company, Inc., in connection with the advertising of Hi C fruit drink, the commission alleged that the Coca‐Cola Company had made false claims as to the nutritional value of the fruit drink and that the name of the product deceptively implied that the drink was high in vitamin C content. • The proposed order would prohibit Coca‐Cola for one year from making nutrient value claims for any product, other than a natural fruit product, unless such claims are accompanied by clear and conspicuous disclosure that the F.T.C. has alleged that previous advertising claiming high vitamin content was false and deceptive. Such af firmative disclosure would be required to constitute no less than 25 per cent of the total space used for print adver tising and no less than 25 per cent of the total time devoted to broadcast adver tisement. Even more drastically, in a complaint charging the Standard Oil Company of Cal ifornia, and its agency, Bat ten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn, with falsely advertis ing that an additive in Chev ron gasoline will reduce air pollution, the commission is seeking to force Chevron to “repent” publicly for one year in all advertising, irrespective of any future antipollution claims. Other complaints and pro posed orders of this type have been filed or are in the process of being filed. In a complaint against E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. in connection with a Zerex anti freeze television demonstra tion, the commission even threatened to cause the prod uct to be removed from the market. The commission's definition of “false advertising” be comes more elastic all the time. Practices that have long been recognized as legally acceptable have come under attack. Perhaps the most important new interpretation by the commission is contained in a recent proposed com plaint against the Continen tal Baking Company, Inc., with respect to the advertis ing of Wonder bread and other products. The commission alleges that by advertising certain nutritive qualities of Wonder bread, its manufacturer is wrongfully representing that other bread products are not as nutritive. The commission thus raises a large question with respect to the future use of pre‐emptive product claims. The essence of the Federal Trade Commission's allegation is that when you advertise particular aspects of your product, you are im plying that these aspects are unique to your product. If this “implied uniqueness” the ory is upheld, advertising of all but a few categories of products will have to under a revolutionary change. • The demands for “full dis closure” in advertising re main unabated. Responsible advertisers, of course, do not oppose the proposition that the consumer should he made aware of pertinent facts to assist him in buying a prod uct. The problem is the va riety of concepts of what is pertinent. In a petition recently filed with the F.T.C., the commis sion is asked to issue a regu lation under which no one should be permitted to ad vertise a product that is chemically identical to oth ers, without clearly disclos ing this identity. The petitioners, Students Against Misleading Enter prises, argue that the con cept of consumer sovereign ty, which has enabled the buyer to make intelligent choices in the market place, is being destroyed by decep tive and misleading adver tising. The petitioners suggest the the commission require ad vertising and labeling of all identical products contain the disclosure that all products in that field are chemically identical. Supposedly, the initial target of this proposed regulation would be aspirin and liquid chlorine bleach. Representative Fred B. Rooney, Democrat of Penn sylvania, has supported this petition with the statement that “When a consumer buys a high‐priced brand‐name as pirin or bleach, he is simply helping underwrite the Madi son Avenue promotions that originally misled him to be lieve that the brand‐name product was superior.” So far, the commission has not acted on this petition, although, of course, its theory of “implied uniqueness,” as propounded in the Wonder bread case, would probably achieve the same result in connection with the adver tising of chemically identical products. • Some of the “consumer ad vocates,” within or outside the Government, would re quire the advertiser to state every possible disadvantage of the product and even re cite competitive factors, such as expected longevity of the product and price differen tials. No one knows how far the advertiser may have to go in deprecating his product. Will automobile X advertis ing be held to be false and deceptive because it doesn't include a disclosure that auto mobile. Y generally yields higher trade‐in value? Will all food advertising have to include calorie count and vitamin content? Not only may the adver tiser never know just how far he would have to go in making disclosures, but he also may get plenty of sec ond‐guessing help. If some of the proposed laws relating to public disclosure of substan tiation for advertising are passed, competitors, consum er advocates and anyone else would have the right to go on fishing expeditions through these materials to determine whether his particular defini tion of “full disclosure” had been met. The possibilities of harassment by competitors and others endless. Never before has the ad vertising industry been sub ject to attack from so many different sources. More “con sumer” legislation, more cases in the F.T.C., more state laws restricting or taxing the industry, and even municipal authorities are becoming in volved. • At a public hearing on a proposed New York City reg ulation under which the city's commissioner of consumer af fairs would gain the right to require the submission of sub stantiation for advertising claims of advertisers who do business in the City of New York, Ralph Nader was the lead‐off witness. He is reported to have rec ommended that the municipal government obtain the power to suspend officials of adver tisers and agencies and to have claimed that Madison Avenue was hurting our mar ket system “more than 10 Kremlins.” No one seems to have asked for substantiation of that claim.

641-> Home Furnishings Industry Goes Big Time
New corporate giants, well financed, aggressive and largely formed by acquisitions, are thrusting their way up through the traditionally conservative surface of the American home furnishings industry. Spurred by a vast housing demand for at least two million new residential units year, a race is under way by about 10 companies to capture the major share in the bright potential indicated for home goods. The prize is a lush one. At retail, the market for furniture, carpeting, appliances, television and related goods has. an estimated value of mote than $20‐billion. Since at least half of this represents the ‘wholesale price, the contestants in the manufacturing market are vying for about $11‐billion to $12‐billion a year in sales. But these figures do not include the likely addition of 10 to 20 per cent in industry volume from the increased rate of housing starts. In March new starts jumped 11.3 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,918,000 from the February level. In March, 1970, there were only 1,392,000 new housing starts. As the race for position intensifies, the home furnishings industry has witnessed these recent developments: ¶Well known specialized concerns, such as the R.C.A. Corporation, Sperry & Hutchinson, Armstrong Cork, Magnavox and Burlington Industries in the last few years have acquired leading furniture and carpet companies and have started major home goods manufacturing complexes. ¶Other, more diversified home furnishings manufacturers such as Mohasco Industries and Simmons Company have added either by internal development or acquisition of new divisions In home furnishings in order to offer a broad line of home products to the public. ¶An over‐all or “umbrella” brand name has been set up by several of these home furnishings giants to project a big new national brand before the public. Burlington, for example, has changed the name of its home furnishings divisions to Burlington House and will market a broad array of furniture, carpets, drapes, etc., under that brand name with an annual promotion budget of more than $7million. Considerable sums are being spent to build these diversified corporate groups. R.C.A., for example, paid about $110‐million in stock to acquire Coronet Industries, Inc., the large tufted carpet manufacturer, last February. U.S. Plywood Champion Papers, Inc., was not reluctant to pay 26 times earnings for Drexel Industries, while Armstrong Cork also found it necessary to pay a similar price‐earnings multiple to acquire Thomasville Furniture Industries. Such multiples are considerably higher than those usually paid for consumer goods companies. Most of these moves to gear up for big potential have been made, ironically enough, during a decline in the industry. As Vanden Broeck & Co., division of Prescott, Merrill, Turben & Co., put it recently in a study of the home products industry, “While most aspects of the economy have shown gradual improvement in the recent past, consumer durables, and in particular furniture and carpets, have continued to lag behind this recovery trend. Shipments of carpet and furniture declined in the last quarter of 1970 and no material pick‐up in shipments is anticipated until the early summer of 1971. However, manufacturer shipments of major appliances rebounded in the early part of 1971 and this trend should extend throughout the year.” One approach many producers took during 1970, year when furniture shipments had their worst decline in almost a decade, was to become involved in promotional pricing, which tended to crimp their profits. However, the brokerage study pointed out, as the consumer begins to increase durable goods expenditures, a firmer price structure will develop, enabling most producers to “significantly improve margins in the latter part of the year.” Already, however, the furniture industry is claiming that the downward trend is being reversed. According to John M. Snow, executive vice president of the National As sociation of Furniture Manufacturers, Chicago, the first two months of 1971 showed that shipments rose 4 per cent over 1970, new orders increased 6 per cent and order backlogs rose 2 per cent. Mr. Snow added, “The most hopeful sigh to us— in this edging up process—is that new order gains exceeded those for shipments and order backlogs showed substantial gain since the end of January.” At retail, sales have also shown a rise of 2 per cent in the first two months of the year over the year before, the National Home Furnishing Association reported on the basis of a sample survey of member stores. ALthough these sales lists at both the wholesale and retail level benefit by comparison with badly depressed months in 1970, industry sources last week were hopeful that the trend had reversed and that consumer sentiment had become more confident. A result, they believe, should be a sharp stepup in big‐ticket purchases. At the same time, however, a debate has arisen among some of the industry's leading producers on whether the take‐over trend is the most effective way of reaching for the big potential that all agree exists or whether smaller or mediumsize specialty manufacturers are not better equipped to satisfy individual consumer needs. Nathan S. Ancell, president of the Baumritter Corporation, believes that his company's approach, the correlation of furniture carpets, wall paper and lamps, is the best way of satisfying the consumer's yen for “a total way of life.” “People want to buy environment, they want pretty home inside and out,” he observed. Baumritter now has 160 “showcase” stores and retail accounts and hopes to build these to 450 units by 1975. These stores would sell mostly Baumritter's Ethan Allen American traditional furniture arranged in room settings, with most of them open on Sunday to allow the public to browse. Other producers, however, are taking a different tack. Sperry & Hutchinson, the trading stamp company that has developed a $175‐million carpet and furniture business by acquisition, hopes to be one of the big diversified home product suppliers by adding more companies and by “spending a lot of money” on marketing programs to provide consumer and dealer service. Albert F. Kaiser, S.&H.'s vice president for interior furnishings, said the company did not plan to go into the retail franchise field. The big trading stamp company decided to venture into the home furnishings field, mak ing its first acquisition in March, 1967, by buying Bigelow Sanford because it felt that it already had a large consumer distribution. “Thirty million families come into our stamp‐redemption centers every year,” Mr. Kaiser said. S.&H. after making its first acquisition has made four others in the furniture field and plans to “coordinate services” or “package home furnishings” with the use of a corporate brand name to obtain consumer awareness. “But that doesn't mean we'll drop American Drew, Lea Gluck, the divisional names,” he added. “We'll preserve them but also have an overall name too. Sort of on the General Motors style.” Mohasco, which bought several leading furniture companies to add to its Alexander Smith, Mohawk and Firth carpets had sales of $306‐million last year, down from $312‐million the year before, and lower net earnings. However, sales in the 1971 first quarter rose 18 per cent and earnings jumped 36 per cent. Herbert L. Shuttleworth 2d, president, expressed satisfaction at the recent annual meeting over the improved results “in the face of the continued softness in both the residential and commercial sectors of the interior furnishings industry.” Like Burlington, Mohasco plans to beef up its promotion budget this year, quadrupling it to $4‐million. Citing improved performance by a number of Mohasco's acquisitions, Mr. Shuttleworth said he was optimistic over the year's prospects, particularly because of the improved consumer confidence and the need for interior furnishings as a result of higher rate of housing starts. As giants such as R.C.A., Magnavox, U.S. Plywood and others flex their marketing muscles and spend considerable sums to buy themselves a stronger position in the industry, what about the traditional leaders? The Kroehler Manufacturing Company, the country's largest producer of upholstered goods, recently reported higher sales and net income for the March quarter following a phasing‐out process for case goods, or wood furniture. Bassett Furniture Industries, the largest producer of case goods, had a rough year in 1970, dropping 4.8 per cent in sales and suffering a 14 per cent decline in operating income. Management said that wood furniture is more directly affected by the rise or fall in housing starts than is upholstered furniture. Who will obtain the lion's or the lamb's share of the lush market? As a first step to realize predictions of a doubling of the market by 1980, the home furnishings industry is cooperating to sponsor a coordinated or “total look” home fashions program for next year. It is scheduled to get a big push in new products and marketing this fall, and hopes to entice major consumer purchasers in 1972. The program is called “Debut ‘72.”

643-> An Appraisal
The motorist speeding by Co‐op City on the Hutchinson River Parkway in the Bronx sees only its looming apart ment towers. The visitor finds a world of its own, set among 22,400 trees. The vast middle‐income housing coop erative built by the United Housing Foundation, a non‐ profit trade union federation, opened three years ago to critical notices about its lack of design distinction. Today, it has one of the most successful landscaping jobs that ever turned a lemon into lemonade. No other housing project in New York can make this statement. There is nothing comparable in scale or stand ard of design. The city's pub lic housing site plans and grounds have been stamped out of the same bleak, un imaginative mold for years, and middle‐income housing has faced such rapidly rising costs that landscaping is a luxury. The green world at Co‐op City is no mean achievement because its base is flat, hy draulic fill—300 acres of salt sand. It started as a desolate limbo. There is only one original tree still on the site. Now, $5.4‐million later there are 177 landscaped acres (the rest is building) by the New York firm of Zion and Breen Associates. These are the landscape architects who gave you Mr. Paley's small, exquisitely so phisticated park on 52d Street. At the base of Co‐op City's towers they have created a gently rolling terrain. Wet sand was pumped in for low hills that hide the traffic be yond the development's car free superblocks. The fill is covered with topsoil and sod, and the grass is embellished with masses of willows, Lombardy poplars, London plane trees and Jap anese black pines that had to be gotten from California when local supplies ran out. There are sand gardens with pine islands surrounded by borders of wooden blocks that are cheaper and prettier than concrete. “We had all that sand and it saved money,” says Robert Zion. Groups of poplars screen garages, and willows fill awk ward spots between buildings. A 31‐acre open park adjoins the educational park and schools being built by the United Housing Foundation, which will be turned back to the city on completion. A two‐story shopping cen ter surrounds a paved court with three ivy and willow islands. A fourth island is a hillock covered with artificial grass of the kind used in stadiums, meant here for children to play on while parents shop. It is worn bald with constant, passionate use. The same imitation grass appears in other hard‐use play areas. It sounds dread ful, but looks fine because there is so much of the real thing around it. There are no formal play grounds. Well‐selected equip ment including tepees climbing devices and simple wooden forms, are scattered through the sand gardens and across the lawns, often as an effective kind of sculpture. Handsome natural rock out croppings are also utilized. Paving is of London block, a prefabricated stone that can be easily replaced in sec tions, and flat cobbles. It borders the apartment houses, where trees will grow to form canopies over head. Group of townhouses are given a more unified, urban setting with “wall to wall” London block inset with ivy beds and willows. A contrac tor had to be set up with special machinery to make the block, which is com monly used in England and Scandinavia. Nothing like it is com monly, or uncommonly, used here. Attractive, patterned paving shown in architects' housing drawings is always the first casualty of costs. Asphalt walks and parking lots shatter planners' dreams and designs. The only blacktop at Co‐op City was put in at the very start, and was rejected im mediately by the landscape architects and the client. As the job went on and rapport increased with the designers, U.H.F. became increasingly open‐handed. At one point, small trees were removed and larger ones substituted at the client's request. The $5½‐mil lion has been spent on land fill, planting, drainage, pave ment, lights and street furniture. All are of exem plary standard. There is some argument about whether U.H.F. hired Zion and Breen as landscape architects and site planners under their own steam or un der pressure by the city's planners. But the result is a successful demonstration of how to humanize housing that many people thought was beyond help. The huge buildings were raised to permit passage and views through at the ground. Everything has been done to soften the project's gigantism at eye level, where it counts. Curiously, Co‐op City resi dents have had to unlearn their inhibitions about using the land. Many were gradu ates of other U.H.F. projects, conditioned by standardized chain‐link fence and keep‐ off‐the‐grass formulas. Early “grievances” includ ed the fact that there were benches on the grass. The designers' emphasis on va riety to relieve the scale and sameness of the structures led to squabbles about “equal ity” of treatment. Today, Co‐op City is neither the purgatory nor the heaven that its critics and champions predicted. It is a functioning community. Only New York—a city of 8 mil lion snobs, skeptics and des perate survivors—could have swallowed a new town of this size within its limits without a ripple. Anywhere else in the world, there would be a steady stream of visitors to see how a community of 45,000‐going‐on‐60,000 takes shape. Co‐op City has none of the chic new‐town esthetics or life‐style cachet of a Res ton, Va. It will never be in the fashionable planning spot light like the new town on Welfare Island being built by the New York State Ur ban Development Corpora tion. Zion and Breen are also the landscape architects for Welfare Island, where they are already running into the asphalt‐paving syndrome. But it has 15,372 well‐ planned apartments that are no mean achievement in New York's stumbling hous ing numbers game. And there is now a young er, more sophisticated man agement at U.H.F. that is going far beyond the founda tion's sterile patterns of the past. In the next project, it may be possible to raise your eyes from the ground.

644-> ‘That Queen Of Secrecy’
KEATS called it “that Queen of Secrecy, the violet.” Others say it is shy and retiring. Yet in InKl wood Hill Park, the New York Botanical Garden, Fort Tryon Park and many other parks in the city, this delicate herb flowers so exuberantly that no passer‐by not completely immersed in workaday worries can miss seeing its rich, violet‐blue blooms. There are more than 50 species of violets in this area. The common, or meadow violet, with the familiar heartshaped leaves (Viola papilionacea) seen most often by urban folk. This is the violet we love to pick and gather in bouquets. Its five dainty petals are irregular and the two lateral petals are beautifully bearded at the flower's white center, probably to prevent rain from diluting the nectar that is secreted in a spur at the base of the lower petal. Behind this bearded barrier, the stigma protrudes and opens two lips like the tip of an elephant's trunk. When bee arrives, he follows the nectar guides, brushing pollen grains gathered from other violets onto the lower lip. Five stamens, with anthers opening inward, clasp the style well below the stigma. Disturbed, they free fresh pollen to dust the visiting insect. As he backs out, the lower lip of the stigma discreetly closes, thus preventing selfpollination. The violet's secret, and an intriguing secret it is, is that it doesn't rely wholly on cross‐pollination to perpetuate the species. After the showy flowers have ceased to bloom, in June and July, the plant produces self‐pollinating cleistogamus flowers. Having only rudimentary petals, two stamens and a pistil, they are found, usually covered by leaves, on or near the ground. They do not open and are fertilized when the pollen tubes grow through the anther walls into the stigma. After fertilization, the capsule remains in the debris where it ripens. Then an amazing thing happens. Gradually, if there is a heavy burden of dead leaves, or, with a quick motion, if the burden is light, the stem straightens, lifting the capsule—now beautifully tinged with purple—above the rubble. Out of its hiding place, the capsule splits into three canoe‐shaped segments, each packed with seeds in orderly arrangement. When they reach horizontal position, the segments proceed to. exert a squeezing pressure on their cargoes of seeds, propelling them outward at time.

645-> Burger Bids Prison Heads Give Inmates Some Voice
WILLIAMSBURG, Va., Dec. 7 — Chief Justice Warren E. Burger called upon the nation's prison administrators tonight to start “communicating” regularly with their prisoners and to let the prisoners “regulate some limited part of their lives, however small.” “We cannot turn the management of a prison over to the inmates,” he said in speech here tonight, “but soclety, as represented by the “keepers,” can listen to what the inmates have to say.” And to the extent that it is “feasible and consistent with orderly administration,” he said, prisoners should be allowed to exercise some measure of “deliberation and choice.” “If we tie a person in a chair for a long time, we can hardly be surprised if he can't walk when we let him loose,” Justice Burger said. “Within limiting regulations necessary for basic order, inmates should be allowed to think and walk and talk as we will demand that they do when they are released.” The Chief Justice's address to the 350 penal experts invited by the Justice Department to a national conference here also called for the separation of “incorrigibles”—particularly “riotprone inmates” — from other prisoners. Holding that the recent riots at Attica and San Quentin had forced the nation to “re‐examine” the attitudes and techniques of its prison system, Justice Burger said that it was “particularly important today” to give “very high priority” to improving the classification of prisoners. Those who would disrupt and destroy a penal institution must be separated to protect lose who are trying to learn and to prepare themselves fer the future,” he said. “Every inmate has a right to be insulated from those who are bent on lawless acts.” He said that the prison problem was of “terrifying magnitude” and, that he hoped the delegates would address themselves to “just a few of the most urgent but soluble problems.” “We must be content with modest progress and small victories,” he said. Among other “urgent needs” that he cited were speedy disposition of cases in the courts, careful training of personnel and adequate compensation and “decent living conditions” in the prisons. On the subject of better living conditions, he said that the prison riots had demonstrated that mite was needed than “good plant and equipment” On the need for a better trained correctional staff, he applauded Attorney General John N. Mitchell's announcement yesterday of plans for a national corrections academy. The Attorney General, who convened the conference at the direction of President Nixon, appears to be giving priority to this plan. Today, he asked that the conference delegates try in their workshops to develop ideas, such as curriculum, for the academy. The Chief Justice asked for athletic and other recreational facilities for prisoners and also for educational programs. “We should develop sentencing techniques to impose a sentence so that an inmate can literally ‘learn his way’ out of prison as we now try to let him earn his way out with “good behavior,” he said. But in addition, he said, ‘We should make certain that every inmate works and works hard.’ “With countless thousands of law‐abiding citizens moonlighting on second jobs to make both ends meet, there is no reason why every healthy prison inmate should not be required to work to earn at least part of his keep,” he said.

647-> DRUG USE LINKED TO HEART ATTACK
SEATTLE. Oct. 9—A 23‐year‐old woman is recuperating here from a heart attack that her doctors said they strongly suspected had resulted from an overdose of “speed,” or amphetamines, which she had injected into her veins. The woman's case is a dramaic example of the serious consequences that can result from drug abuse. Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, and infections of the heart are said to be common, serious medical complications of drug abuse that can require long, expensive hospitalization. Dr. David C. Dale, the chief medical resident physician at the University of Washington Hospital, said in an interview that the woman's heart attack had cost Federal and state taxpayers $1,000 for her care in the coronary care unit. The woman is fortunate because she survived her medical complication of drug abuse. However, many addicts die from medical complications of their habit before they even reach a hospital for treatment. In other cases, doctors are unaware that their patients have taken narcotics. Accordingly, the physicians said that it was not known how many other drug abusers had suffered heart attacks — called myocardial infarctions—from the drugs that they had improperly taken. The doctors said that they suspect that the large amounts of amphetamine the woman took caused her heart to beat rapidly, to work extremely hard, and the coronary arteries to constrict — thus depriving the organ of its nourishment and thereby destroying a vital area of muscle. Though the cause differed, the result was similar to the damage older men and women suffer from heart attacks resulting from arteriosclerosis, or hardened arteries. When Dr. Stephen R. Shaul, a medical resident at the hospital, saw the woman in the emergency room at 2 o'clock one recent morning, he said that at first he had been skeptical that her severe chest pains were due to a heart attack. But when Dr. Shaul saw the tell‐tale squiggles on her electrocardiogram, or heart tracing, indicating a heart attack, he said the diagnosis was clear to him and to the hospital cardiologists. Later, when laboratory technicians reported the results of her blood tests, they further helped to confirm the diagnosis. The woman told her doctors that she had dissolved eight methadrine (amphetamine) tablets in water and then injected the solution Into her needlescarred veins late the previous afternoon. The dose was the largest that she had taken, she said, in expectation of her “biggest kick.” The woman told her doctors that it was the third time she had shot “speed” that day and that she had, in the past, used other drugs including heroin and LSD. Immediately thereafter, Dr. Dale said that she had a headache, chills and sweating, followed by a severe crushing pain in her chest and her arms. Her physicians said that they had discounted the possibility that the woman's heart attack was due to an infection of a valve or the inside wall of her heart because no bacteria grew from several cultures of her blood. Infection of the heart, called bacterial endocarditis, is considered an important complication of drug abuse. Sometimes treatment necessitates open heart surgery, costing several thousand dollars, often at public expense. While the woman addict was being treated in the coronary care unit, she told Dr. Dale and her nurses that she “was afraid to let her mother know she was ill because my mother will bawl me out.” Once her pain disappeared on the second day of her stay, she became bored and upset with the restraints that, due to the seriousness of her heart damage, the doctors had imposed on her physical activities. Five days after the woman entered, Dr. Dale said, “She signed out of the hospital against medical advice. She returned to the heart clinic for follow‐up care last week. Depending on her future medical course, the doctors said they might do more extensive tests to determine if another cause existed for her heart attack. Meanwhile, until evidence is found to the contrary, the doctors said her heart attack was due to “speed.”

648-> NO YACHTS START RACE TO NASSAU
MIAMI, March 1—One hun dred yachts sailed for daylight today as, the 176‐mile race from Miami to Nassau began under the darkness of a squall off Miami Beach. With flukey winds from the east a strong current out of the north and, the first big rain drops splashing against their sails, the small Class E boats, which started first struggled to get going this feature event of the Southern Ocean Racing Conference. By the time the Class A yachts, led by the 73‐foot Wind ward Passage, crossed the starting line an hour later, the sun was shining brightly, and the wind, had picked up to 15 knots from the southeast. Seas were about three to four feet high. Running Tide Jakob Isbrandt sen's 60‐foot sloop, which is the over‐all leader for the S.O.R.C. title, had a good start. So did Nepenthe, T. Vincent Learson's 50‐footer, and Dora, the 55‐ foot cutter owned by Lynn A. Williams of Chicago. Windward Passage, owned by Mark John son, trailed Running Tide by 74 points in the standing. Yankee Girl, David D. Steere's 57‐foot sloop from Cape Cod, Mass., which began the race in second place over all, 2½ points behind, found herself in diffi culty in the early going and changed headsails after about 10 minutes. Other early class leaders in cluded Bandit, owned by Al bert G. Van Metre of Annapo lis, Md., in Class B, and Fire brand II, 43‐foot sloop owned by Dennis Miller in Class C. Tanglefoot in Class D and Hammerhead in Class E led the smaller yachts across the starting line, with Caliente, the over‐all Class D leader, in Tanglefoot's wake. The course sends the fleet across the Gulf Stream to Great Isaac Light, about 67 miles northeast of Miami, then eastward to Great Stirrup Cay and southward to the finish line at Nassau. The race counts 35 per cent toward the S.O.R.C. title.

654-> LISBON ACTS TO CURB STUDENTS' PROTEST
LISBON, Jan. 17—Portuguese university authorities an nounced today that Lisbon's Advanced Technical Institute would be closed tomorrow. Lisbon University students had scheduled a meeting at the institute tomorrow to protest the Defense Minister's recent threat to end draft deferments for students. Defense Minister Horácio José do Sá Viana Rebelo warned that if the climate of “subversion” continued at the university, students would be conscripted at the age of 21. The Minister acknowledged that there was growing opposition in many of Portugal's higher schools to the military effort against guerrillas in Portu guese Africa. He said that this “perversion” was having a bad effect among officer recruits and was leading to desertions. The police were called to Lisbon University twice last week to break up a student meeting and agitation in the medical school. Several stu dents were reported injured in a clash with the police and sev eral were said to have been arrested. As a result, students of the law, letters and medical schools have gone on strike, although strikes are illegal in this country.

655-> Turks'Leader Says Closer Greek Ties Depend on Cyprus
ATHENS, July 24—Premier Nihat Erim of Turkey told the Greeks in an interview today that there could be no real friendship and cooperation be tween Greece and Turkey until the Cyprus problem was solved. He appealed to the friends of the two neighboring nations to help them overcome this obstacle. Dr. Erim, who was inter viewed in Ankara by Chris Bitsidis, general manager of the state ‐ controlled Athens News Agency, spoke of the broad scope for Greek‐Turkish coop eration not excluding even “some form of confederation.” The Turkish Premier said: “As soon as the [Cyprus] problem is settled, we could initiate a new phase in Greek‐ Turkish relations, conclude a very special agreement between our two countries, and inaugu rate a special relationship such as the one among the Anglo Saxon countries.” The interview, made public here today, coincided with a smouldering crisis in Cyprus after a Turkish‐Cypriote shep herd was shot by a Greek‐ Cypriote guard near one of the fortified pockets in which the Turkish minority, outnumbered 5 to 1, has lived barricaded since 1963.

656-> Carnage on Highways
Letters to the Editor Carnage on Highways To the Editor: As sickened as I am by the carnage on our highways, I cannot believe that the speeder or in most cases even the drunk driver is a criminal. Yet for all procedural purposes he is so treated. The object of traffic laws is to compel the driver to devote his full attention to driving, but criminal sanctions do not appear to have the desired effect. Fines in this affluent age have no meaning. Jail sentences for traffic in fractions are rarely imposed. Instead of attempting to enforce the traffic laws criminally, they ought to be enforced administratively. Opera tors and owners of cars are licensees of the state, and I recommend that they demonstrate their suitability to hold such licenses. I would propose that a traffic violator be required to explain to the licensing authority his alleged lack of attention to the vehi cle and traffic laws. He could do so near his own home rather than at the place of the offense as now required. A report to the li censing authority covering the al leged inattention will have been sub mitted by the apprehending officer, Who ought to be an employe of the licensing authority rather than policeman (enforcement of most traffic laws degrades policemen, and get ting policemen out of traffic law enforcement would be one of the beneficial by‐products of the plan pro posed here). If the violator would pre fer a direct confrontation with the officer he would then have to go to the officer's duty station, and the hearing could be held there. But it would be up to the alleged violator to demonstrate that he was paying the strict attention that driving requires today. It would not be in cumbent upon the licensing authority to prove its licensee guilty beyond reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty. Punishment would not consist of incarceration and only rarely of fines. The main lever would be action against the license. Certain motor vehicle offenses, of course, could and should remain subject to criminal law enforcement: criminally negligent homicide; reckless driving and driving while intoxicated in higher degrees. I am certain that administrative en forcement of traffic laws is feasible. I am certain that if we are to reduce significantly the number of traffic deaths and injuries, effective action to compel the operators of motor vehi cles to devote complete attention to such operation is essential. A start has been made toward the reduction of traffic deaths and in juries by incorporating safety features into vehicles. We can no longer afford to play “cops and robbers” on our highways. The licensee must contin ually demonstrate his right to the privilege of operating and owning motor vehicle.

658-> Art Mailbag
To THE EDITOR: N his review of the exhibit, “Eight Afro‐American Artists,” at the Rath Museum in Geneva, Switzerland, David Shirey presents clear evidence that he is sorely remiss in his knowl edge of American art history (i.e., his reference to Jasper Francis Cropsey as a black artist!) and black people. As director of that exhibition, I feel obliged to comment on some of his way ward statements and questionable evaluations to prevent: 1) the public from getting the wrong impression as to the basic intent of the show; 2) the possibility of the participating artists suffering irreparable harm, and 3) the establishment of groundwork for dis sension amongst artists in the black community. The basic Intent of the Geneva ex hibit, as I clearly stated in my Introduction in the catalogue, was “to provide international exposure for a select group of black American artists in the hope that an imaginative cross‐section of ar tistic expression by blacks would serve to promote better understanding of, and appreciation for, the Afro‐American achievement and potential.” This so journ to Europe might not have been at all necessary if quality black artists had not been so thwarted in their efforts to enter the mainstream of American art. The fact that blacks’ prowess in the visual arts is unknown to Europeans— and to the majority of Americans, for that matter—can he directly attributed to several causes, the most glaring be ing 1) their ceremonious exclusion from exhibitions and collections at home and those sent abroad, and ‐2) the assidu ously negative criticisms by instant experts like Shirey who consciously labor to keep the Afro‐American artist “in his place”—thus creating “black art,” a non‐existent art form! It is inconceivable to me that an American, ostensibly in tune with the times, would find the term “Afro‐Amer ican” puzzling. The use of a prefix to identify ethnic groups is an accepted practice in this country's language and literature. The terms “Afro‐American,” “Black,” “Negro”—or Italian‐American, if you will—might all be thought of as socio‐political designations, and are not determinants of specific kinds of artistic expressions. My arbitrary selection of the term “Afro‐American,” used in the exhibition title, was merely to specify the ethnicity of this particular group of American artists. It was not used to delineate a “school” of art, or a pecul iar esthetic, or the socio‐political goals or ambitions of these exhibiting artists except as these concerns surfaced them selves in the free expressions of the in dividual artists. Obviously, Shirey didn't read the Preface in the catalogue carefully (if at all!), for if he had, he would have found no discrepancy in the relationship that I cited between one's African heritage and the effects of acculturation. No amount of acculturation can completely eliminate the primal nature of one's heritage. Traces of the “African spirit” and the “black experience” abound in this contemporary exhibition. If there was a single unifying factor in this diverse show, it was the artists’ persistent preference for vibrant color and their consummate use of same. Wilbur Haynie, one of the four West Coast artists whom Shirey did not anoint with his approval, credits his adroit use of dynamic design and orig inal color relationships in his hard edge paintings to his African heritage. Ruth Tunstall, the 26‐year‐old painter‐print maker of Dallas, freely admits the in fluence of both Matisse and Vasarely. However, she masterfully tempers these influences In her own naturalness of expression as a black individual, and what results is an art that is at once inspired and innovative. Alvin Smith, the young New York painter‐constructionist whom Shirey found to be “eclectic,” although con ceding that his work “has been done with more than a modicum of elegance and technical refinement,” is a con temporary abstractionist who uses chroma with such skill and intensity that one could justifiably associate this affinity with his African heritage. Frederick Everslcy, the plastic sculptor, continues the African preference for ge ometry, enhancing it further by his use of ‘California color” that is uniquely American. Marvin Harden's elegant and techni cally superior pencil drawings of an amalgamated‐style, revealed in the titles of these works a formidable sense of humor that is reminiscent of the kind one encounters on the streets of any black ghetto, or that one associates with African village story‐tellers who used such wit to make clear the morals of their tales. By placing his minuscule cows and horses in an unlikely abstract context, and by using outrageously lengthy and equally titillating titles, he offers in these recent drawings a direct contrast to his other works in the show from an earlier stage of development. It's really amazing that Shirey did not discern the obvious progression, for if this had been the case, he certainly would not have questioned the inclusion of the total number of ten drawings by this artist. Moreover, while Shirey could only see that the late Bob Thompson “manifested a strong affection for Matisse and Gauguin in color and technique,” the re viewer's “expertise” did not grant him the extended perception to see that Thompson's inspiration and motivations were also conditioned by his “black ex perience.” For instance, the late paint er's work, “The Hairdresser,” gives firm evidence that he had first‐hand knowl edge of the activity within the many beauty parlors that are characteristic institutions in Harlems all over America. Sue Irons's soft sculptural forms, filled with colored water and impressively suspended’ with heavy docking rope, would—upon cursory viewing—appear to be a gimmick. I am, however, singu larly impressed with her totally un conscious preoccupation with symbols that are so characteristic of African art. For all its brilliance of color, Alvin Smith's “Orangeburg: In Memorium” packs a wallop to the memory in recall ing the murder of four black students by white policemen. His huge canvas depicting the horrendous “Mylai” mas sacre is no less shattering in its impact. Shirey has further insinuated that some kind of unethical censorship was exercised in the show. I also explained in the catalogue Introduction that there was absolutely no primary concern to either include or to exclude protest art from the Rath Museum show. The prob lem was, in fact, that so much art of that expression falls so far short of be ing art that it would serve no good pur pose in presenting it to American audi ences, let alone European! The recent Whitney Museum exhibit, “Contempo rary Black Artists in America,” which Shirey himself uses as an example, is an excellent case in point. What the Whitney presented to the public was example after example of “art” that, in truth, could only be called emotional doggerel. If this is the type of exhibit that Shirey and the visitors who voiced “dis appointment” expected, it could only have been for the sheer expiation of their deep guilt feelings about blacks. I didn't then, nor do I now, see the va lidity of exporting an endless display of negativism about black life. It would in deed have been presumptuous of me to think that I could best the American media in that area! The exhibition succeeded mightily in demonstrating—with a minimum of artists—the qualitative diversity that exists among black artists. It further calls attention to the fact that a black director can function in the realm of fine art, and that a black may still know what best represents blacks! Finally, the American public will have the opportunity to come to its own con clusions with regard to this controver sial exhibition upon viewing it at the Brooklyn Museum in June, 1972.

659-> Mucic
AT a recent television show in Paris, a 12‐ year‐old girl rose from the audience and asxed pianist Alexis Weissen berg, “How does it feel to be important?” “I don't know,” he answered, somewhat taken aback. “Well, aren't you im portant?” she insisted. “I can only tell you,” he replied, “while I am working I have to feel important, otherwise I would not be able to go on.” “I think it is true,” he said, as he related the incident in a Manhattan hotel room dur ing a quick stopover. “To be convincing, you must be con vinced of what you are do ing, and by that point alone you are important. It's part of the energy you have to fabricate for a performance. But if afterwards, when you leave the stage, you still feel important, then maybe you should be slapped.” This blend of detachment, cool self‐appraisal and humor is characteristic of Alexis V.'eissenberg. He has known quick success and quicker failure. Meteoric rise and oblivion. Tense and mercuri al he burst on the scene at the age of 18 in a blaze of critical acclaim, had a flick ering career as Sigi Weissen berg, and vanished from the concert circuit 10 years later. Now, at 42, Weissenberg is riding the crest of a spectacu lar comeback. A man of his Only, he looks more like a Hell's Angel than a pianist in his mod, tight hip‐huggers, wide leather belt, black open necked cotton shirt, and blue black leather jacket. With 90 concerts sched uled Oh iiiree continents next season, 15 record albums in U.S. catalogues (several more in:Europe), three musical tel olkidn films (one, “Petrouch ka,” a prize‐winning NET fa vorite), and a weekly radio interview program on WNCN beginning in October—all ac complished within less than four years—Weissenberg is in the lop rank of his profes sion. Today he is due to fly in from a Salzburg festival appearance. Next Friday he plays a “Weekend prelude” recital at Tanglewood where, the night after, he performs the Ravel Piano Concerto in G with the Boston Symphony under the baton of Michael Tilson Thomas. Four days later, he joins Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Phil harmonic in St. Moritz, Swit zerland. “I like the fast tempo of this career,” he admits. “But as a way of life it is com pletely unconvincing and crazy. I don't believe in the impersonal routine of check ing in and out of hotel rooms, packing suitcases, and giving the key back. But if you need music—and it's not even a matter of love, music is in you, you are not in it—then performing, with that extra energy a concert can give you, is completely necessary. And I think that joy justi fies everything else.” Weissenberg travels all over Europe with his own Hamburg Steinway concert grand, Phenomenon II. “It is much better known to cus toms officials than I am,” he says proudly. “Most people hesitate to ask me why I call him Phenomenon II. May be they think I consider my self Phenomenon I? But there is no Phenomenon I.” Like all pianists, he has a very personal relationship with the instrument. “I have great respect for hint, and I treat him like a pharaoh.” Him? “Oh yes. A piano is defi nitely not a she. I think a piano has the potential of a bull, and to dominate it is one of the most exciting things for a pianist. It's espe cially exhilarating when there is a David‐Goliath feel ing about it. Have you ever noticed when Horowitz sits at the piano that there is something magical happen ing? You can see it, not only hear it: He grows, and the piano reduces. He is oversize suddenly. And that, of course, is the art of a great pianist.” Does Weissenberg, wiry and slight at 5 feet, 6 inches and 135 pounds, ever feel larger than life? “Yes. 1!:+ order to project, I think it is neces sary to be oversize, in a way.” Born in Sofia, Bulgaria, Alexis Sigismund Weissen berg started piano lessons at the age of 3. “All anecdotes are the same,” he says rather impatiently. “We all seem to be geniuses and are taught by our mothers.” But Sigi (“a kiddie name” he has tried to live down ever since) soon re vealed a phenomenal facility, became the bane of his classmates, the pet pupil of Bulgaria's foremost com poser, Pantcho Vladigeroff, and gave public recitals in his early teens. In 1945, dur ing the Soviet occupation, he and his mother left Bulgaria, were stopped at the Turkish border, imprisoned, escaped six months later, and fled to Israel. There he played his first concert with an orches tra. Before the year was out, he had completed a concert tour of South Africa. He was 16 when his mother (his parents were divorced) decided that “if I had to de velop an individuality as an artist, I would certainly first have to develop as a human being.” An unlikely Jewish Mother, she sent her son to the United States alone. “She always said that as soon as society decides that a child has a definite talent, the mother should be killed in stantly, even if the child is only 6 years old,” Weissen berg remembers appreci atively. He studied at Juilliard with Olga Samaroff and worked intermittently with Wanda Landowska. He won the Phil adelphia Youth Orchestra competition, and, in 1948, the Leventritt award, Which had as its prize an appearance with the New York Philhar monic under George Szell. “In those days everybody knew he was a fire‐eater,” Harold Schonberg once wrote. But over the years, instead of flourishing, his career be gan to fade, critics had sec ond thoughts and, in 1957, his concertizing came to an abrupt halt. “There is really no solution,” Weissenberg ex plains. “It's a problem that afflicts most young perform ers. If a young artist has the potentialities, it is essential for him to perform early be fore an audience to develop his personality. On the other hand, his inner gifts and the talent almost always need de velopment privately. Many things are experimental and uncerioin in you, and you are playing a lot of pieces badly. At such an early age one is not mature enough to be pro tected against the reactions that are often too violent from the critics and audience. Then, suddenly, you find the major orchestras don't re engage you, you have neither dates in large cities nor re cordings, and you have slid into playing too many com munity concerts (performing the same recital again and again in places like Oshkosh and Podunk). And how many times a year can one honestly and decently play ‘Liebes traum’ without going nuts? “There is also the danger in being considered great and fabulous at too early an age, because you rarely live up to it later. And for how long can you be a promising bril liant young pianist? There comes a time when you have to be something more defi nite.” He decided to take a sabbatical and left for Paris to “read more, live more, and rethink everything I had done it was a desperate step.” Managing on a small fami ly allowance, he studied lit erature and philosophy, mar ried the daughter of a Spanish diplomat, and made his home in Madrid for a while. Weis senberg recalls this period as his “second formative years,” when at nights he sharpened his intellect in parleys with writers, politicians and phil osophers, and days probed into the works of Bach, Mozart, Schumann, Chopin, Brahms, Bartok, Prokofiev and Stravinsky. But What was intended as a temporary pause, a time for development and re‐eval nation, threatened to turn into enforced retirement. And it was not until 1967 that Weissenberg re‐emerged on the concert scene, largely through the efforts of a de termined Euroon concert manager, who introduced him to Herbert von Karajan. Von Karajan was impressed enough to invite him to open the Berlin Philharmonic's 1966–67 season. In February, 1967, he gave his first con cert in the United States in 10 years. It was a triumphal return. Not only were the critics lavish in their praise, but soon requests for Weis senberg appearances came from major orchestras, sum mer festivals, television—and two recording companies of fered contracts. Like most artists whose jet‐age existence binds them to a timetable, Weissenberg regiments his life fiercely. Speaking as rapidly and ar ticulately as he plays the pi ano, he confides that he prac tices very little—only about two and a half hours a day. “But this is not a question of merit,” he says emphatic ally. “1 think it is a matter of concentration. Besides, study the score first without an instrument. And only when I have thoroughly assimilated it, the technical work at the piano begins.” But isn't it also a matter of facility? “Yes, but facility is the least guaranteed quality in an artist. Facility helps the original organization of the fingers, and it is what gives the performance spontaneity. But more important is that an interpreter has chewed up the work, has resolved with in himself how he would like to perform it. There comes a moment when the applica tion of your hands is not felt any longer, and the piece grows out of you and begins its own life within you. Then you can project it at will— I wouldn't say by pushing button—but your entire mind and temperament switch in stantly to that version which has taken shape in your body.” A firm believer in logic and control, Weissenberg has been accused of coldness in his interpretations. “Yes, and some critics even go so far as to say this is an IBM ma chine. But what does this mean? Too much directed by your head? Love, passion— doesn't it all go through your head? In music everything must be controlled, otherwise it falls into little pieces. But within the range of what have decided to do in a piece, I am absolutely free. I may be more reserved one even ing, and more spontaneous another.” What puzzles Weissenberg is that “the same public that expects something complete ly contemporary from an art exhibit or a novel is sur prised that at a concert it does not get the same inter pretation it has encountered for 50 years. Today, you ex press your feelings directly and without circumvention. Everything has become clear er and more naked. So many actors now act in the nude. If music is not to remain in a museum, an interpreter must speak in a language that today's people under stand. You can still have feel ing, only the manner in which you express this has changed. Take Chopin, for example. He is violent and tender, not hys terical and sweet.” et: Weissenberg sees no con tradiction in melding the present with the past. “Blue jeans in a 17th‐century home” is how he describes his life style. Divorced from his wife, he lives informally in a sec ond‐floor apartment of a con verted townhouse in Paris, op posite the Louvre, with a big black poodle named Tcherno (Bulgarian for black) and a Spanish couple who look aft er his needs. He enjoys the company of a few close friends, but does not like parties and abhors after‐concert receptions. “The compliments are wrong, be cause you know yourself whether the performance was a success or not. And if it was bad, you are miserable and even the applause does not help, But when you are unhappy, you don't want to be alone. (I sit up the whole night and remember the en tire concert, everything. I go through every note, every thing I didn't like.) What you need is a few loving people around you who will not talk about the concert.” Weissenberg usually vaca tions with his daughters, Cris tina, 14, and Maria, 9, on the Spanish or French sea coasts, where his mother sometimes joins them. Occa sionally lie relaxes in Zer matt, Switzerland, his favor ite mountain resort, but gets depressed when he stays there more than 10 days. “I could never imagine living in a quiet place. I need the quickness of the city, the ner vousness. It recharges me.” But for a physical and men tal rest? “The sea does it for me. The sea is very ner vous and violent.” The thought of the turbu lent sea suddenly reminds him of his own intense, high voltage existence. He glances at his watch, picks up his luggage, and in the descend ing elevator delivers his part ing shot: “I have been very lucky and I really have no right to complain. But I do wish people would stop talking about how I played 20 years ago. It, sounds exactly like a prostitute who married a very rich man, and now lives on Park Avenue, and every now and then at a party someone reminds her that, originally, she was on the sidewalk. If the woman is ele gant and intelligent and has made a good marriage, why should you always remind her that she was in a bar before?”

661-> Chilean Opposition Denounces Plan to Alter the Legislature
SANTIAGO, Chile, Nov. 22—The Opposition Christian Democratic party today denounced the Government's proposed constitutional reform that would creates one‐chamber legislature to replace the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. “What the proposed measures seek is, simply, to obtain total control over the legislative and judicial power in a new move reflecting the well‐known Marxist tactics of seeking total power at any cost,” Senator Narciso Irureta, the Christian Democrats’ president, said in a statement. If Congress, which is controlled by the Opposition, rejects the “people's assembly” proposed by President Salvador Allende Gossens, this could lead to a national plebiscite. Dr. Allende's more radical supporters have been pushing for such a confrontation to break Opposition control of the legislature. “If rejection of the project produces a plebiscite, we are sure that the overwhelming majority of the aountry will be with us against this attempt to change the democratic character of Chile's political system,” Senator Irureta said at a news conference. The Christian Democrats, Chile's largest Opposition party, were in power under the former President, Eduardo Frei Montalva. Warns on Violence The Senator warned the Government on increasing violence in university, and peasant and slum conflicts arising from political rivalries. Over the weekend, members of a Communist‐led shanty community, Nuevo Puerto Montt, attacked a nearby encampment of 145 families led by an evangelical pastor and burned down the four‐room church and school. More than 1,000 students from the University of Chile and the Catholic University marched today to protest a Communist and Socialist effort to dominate the University of Chile and oust the rector, Dr. Edgardo Boeningcr, who was re‐elected to his post in July as an independent, with Christian Democratic support. The marchers clashed violently in front of the Catholic University with a smaller number of students from the radical Revolutionary Left Movement and from the left‐wing Social Christian movement. Stones and sticks flew but the police dispersed the marchers quickly with tear‐gas grenades. However, the marchers occupied the university's main buildings. The proposed “people's assembly” is one of the growing number of executive initiatives being blocked or substantially altered by the legislature. One of the major tests coming up is approval of the 1972 budget, submitted by Minister of Finance Americo gorilla Rojas. The Opposition is demanding a full‐scale debate on Chile's economic problems before approving the budget, including an explanation of Dr. Allende's reason for asking renegotiation by foreign creditors of debts reported at $3‐billion. Castro Discusses U.S. Base PUNTA ARENAS, Chile, Nov. 22 (AP)—Premier Fidel Castro said today that Cuba would eventually get the United States Navy out of its Guantanamo base, perhaps without firing a single shot. “There is a new state of consciousness in the world. Things are changing. Some day Cuba will get Guantanamo back from the United States,” he told students at the State Technical University here. The Cuban leader has been in Chile for nearly two weeks as the guest of Dr. Allende. It is his first trip to a Latin‐American country in 11 years. Mr. Castro had to cancel a fishing trip because of bad weather, so he made an unscheduled appearance at the university. About 600 students — threefourths of the total enrollment —turned out to hear him.

Since the assassination of President Kennedy seven years ago, his widow, now had turned down White House invitations as being “too painful” and “too soon” after her tragedy. But last week she and her two children, Caroline and John, secretly visited the Executive Mansion for the first time as guests of Presi dent and Mrs. Nixon. The purpose was to preview official portraits of President Kennedy and Mrs. Onassis that went on public display the following day. The portraits, painted by Aaron Shikler, show the former President with arms folded and in a pensive mood, and his widow in a full‐length impression that has been described as “haunting” (see detail above) and “right out of Camelot.”

665-> F.C.C. AIDE URGES FIGHT ON ‘THE RIGS’
WASHINGTON, May 23— Nicholas Johnson, a commis sioner of the Federal Communi cations Commission, urged the nation's youth today to help right the wrongs of what he termed “the big business‐big axis.” His remarks came in a speech to the graduating class of Windham College in Putney, Vt., and made available here. Denouncing what he called the three‐part axis of “the bigs,” he contended, “The same guys who put the garbage in the air are putting the garbage in our heads — and are serving the closest advisers to the Pres ident.” He urged the graduates “not to cast your talents with Amer ica's top 500 corporations.” “Otherwise, he said, “it is go ing to take Ralph Nader—with me and thousands of other Americans who are working for what are really quite mod est reforms— a lot longer to bring them about.” He suggested that youth re solve not to be what he saw as willing pawns “for the life‐style that fuels the factories, and at the same time fills the streams and air and earth with the dis cards of last year's products that no one needed then, or really wanted.” The wrongs of society, he said, can be righted; progress, he contended, is being made and victory is inevitable.

667-> Much of Rome Has No Water But Lots of Garbage and Strikes
ROME, May 8—A thirsty and dirty weekend began for Romans and tourists when water taps in half the city ran dry at noon today, coincidentally the fourth day of a sanitation workers’ strike. At the same time, guests of deluxe hotels had to make their own beds, carry their own bags and look for snacks somewhere In the neighborhood as service personnel continued walking out erratically in wildcat strikes for higher pay. At Leonardo da Vinci International Airport near here, arriving travelers had to retrieve their bags from the holds of airplanes and carry them to customs whenever ground personnel staged one of their many stoppages. Some 1.3 million Romans are to remain without running water until Wednesday morning because the water board says it needs four days to connect its complex network with a new aqueduct that has been built to supply the city's needs for the next 50 years. When the waterless days for half of the city's population and territory were announced last month, nobody foresaw that the sanitationmen, together with all other city workers, would walk out during the period. The 25,000 municipal employes on Wednesday started what was planned as a three‐day strike for higher, pay and revised civil‐service gradings. Last night the strikers decided to stay away from their jobs until at least Tuesday, although their unions showed concern because of growing public hostility. The walkout has left all streets and piazzas filled with garbage, has closed down all city offices and has even shut down the vast Campo Verano cemetery on Rome's eastern outskirts. Political parties are worried because the strike of city workers may lead to a postponement of municipal elections, scheduled for June 13. Electioneering has already started, littering the messy streets with campaign leaflets, but if the city is unable to distribute registration certificates to voters within the next few days, the election will have to be put off until autumn. The central Government has ordered hundreds of its own police forces into Rome's center because the municipal traffic policemen have joined the strike. One of the places where water was still plentiful today was the Trevi Fountain, a tourist landmark that receives its water from an aqueduct that goes back to antiquity. Following exhortations by the authorities, householders earlier this week filled up bathtubs and large containers for the waterless days. Plastic containers and bottled mineral water sold out in many stores. The dry area comprises all sections west of the Tiber River, including Vatican City, and about half of Rome's historic center. More tribulations are In store for Romans. The truckers’ unions announced today they would call out members for a 58‐hour strike tomorrow night in a controversy over the renewal of their contract. This means that food markets will be without most of their customary supplies from Monday morning.

668-> Peking Residents Ride the Subway Just for Fun
PEKING, May 8—For two cents you can ride the entire 15 miles of the Peking subway from the Military Museum station in the outskirts to Peking Station and back. Every day, officials say, some 60,000 people take the ride just for the fun of it. The following dispatch is by Audrey Topping, who is on a visit to Communist China with her father, Chester A. Ronning, a retired Canadian diplomat. The fun consists of whizzing through the tunnels in a sparkling new train and looking at the 16 palatial stations, all built of different colored marble from Yunnan. No two stations are alike in lighting, construction and color—a white one, a red one, a pink one, a black one and a cream and green one, among others. As the train passed through the stations young people learning to work on the subway stood by the elaborate marble pillars and waved their little red books of the sayings of Chairman Mao Tse‐tung at the passengers. The passengers waved their red books back. The subway is not yet open for general use. It was inaugurated on Oct. 1, 1969, and since then visitors from 60 countries on five continents have ridden on it. They were escorted down the moving stairway, which is switched on for them, served jasmine tea in china cups and given a briefing by the subway commandant before being whisked off. The official said that “four million of our own masses have also ridden the subway and every day 60,000 people are allowed to go for a ride.” The subway was started on Sept. 1, 1965, “in accordance with Mao's policy of self‐reliance,” According to the commandant, both Mr. Mao and Lin Piao, his deputy, showed great concern over the project,and the guiding principle was the chairman's statement that it should be “carefully designed and carefully constructed.” A Four‐Year Project “There may be twists and turns in the building of the subway,” he said, “but we will overcome and correct them.” The project took four years and three months, with army men, revolutionary cadres, technicians and 700 groups from 28 provinces and cities doing the work. “In the building of the subway,” the commandant said, “the workers, in accordance with Mao's instructions, displayed courage and studied Mao's thoughts to overcome the difficulties.” The trains, made in Changchun, have 60‐seat cars that hold 180 people, the commandant said, adding that the longest trains have six cars. They travel at 50 miles an hour. “At first we had all the cause we have not studied Mao's instructions carefully enough,” he explained. “The sound is very loud and we are trying to cut the noise. There are also some wires on the walks and people can see them when they ride the train. This is not very comfortable for them.” “At first we had all the lights red to signify that the East is red,” he said, “but we did not realize that it would make it very dark, so we changed to white light.” Hsu Wen‐chang, the motorman, is delighted with his job. He plays taped music and switches his lights off and on for the benefit of the passengers who turn up to look out the front window. The interior of the subway was the only place in Peking where visitors were asked not to take photos.

671-> Shanghai Feast Challenges Americans
SHANGHAI, April 15 (UPI) —A banquet offered today to the visiting table tennis team supported. good‐natured complaints by. seine of the Americans that the Chinese are giving them too much to eat. The eight‐course meal consisted of about 25 foods. At the center of each table was a revolving board that enabled the diners to turn to whatever they fancied. The first course was what the Chinese call a “hundred flowers cold plate.” It included duck eggs, hundred year‐old eggs (these have actually been buried underground or covered with mud or clay until they blacken after several months), ham slices, chicken, roast duck and pork. In addition there were such vegetables as onions, green peppers, fried mushrooms, bamboo shoots and cucumbers with sesame seed oil, There was also peppery crisp beef and frozen pineapple duck in jelly, prepared in the style of Szechwan province. The banquet‐hardened Americans decided to leave room for what they knew would follow. The second course was delicately flavored, lightly fried shrimp with pigeon eggs cluttering the edge of a plate one foot in diameter. Next came Shanghai duck, a whole fowl that was salted down and baked and then served to a choice of brown sauce or a mixture of finely chopped green onions and ginger. The waiter explained with a certain amount of pride that Shanghai duck not only combined the best features of well‐known pressed Nanking duck and the even more renowned Peking duck but also that it was even better. None of the busy eaters cared to dispute him. There also was a weak wine, called hsiao hsing, which comes from a nearby area in Chekiang province. For those who wished to indulge, there was the more potent mao tai wine, which is favored in North China to help withstand the cold. From then on throughout the remaining courses, plus apples and tangerines for dessert, the clinking of glasses could be heard at all the tables. After a session of toasting, the fourth course appeared. It, consisted of two plates One contained white chicken meat wrapped in steamed flour and shaped like carp and butterflies. The second contained sweet cookies with fillings shaped and colored like strawberries, peaches and water chestnuts. The next course consisted of two very small plates of vegetables — cabbage, onion and ginger then a large plate of broad beans, a special Chinese bean, and white mushrooms with shrimp atop tender Chinese cabbage leaves. Having been informed by the waiter that these beans could not be readily obtained in Peking, the diners turned to the next course—fresh Mandarin fish, complete from head to tail, smothered with a sweet and sour sauce. Far too polite to groan over all the splendid food, the Americans still were glad to get to the Chinese‐style mealender. This was a tangy soup in the middle of which was whole chicken, along with white mushrooms and shrimp slices.

672-> Market Place: Dousing Hopes On Egypt's Oil
While the Egyptian Gov ernment has been touting the quality and quantity of the flow from its new El Alamein oil field in the Western desert, the Standard Oil Com pany (Indiana), the operator, has been soft‐pedaling then development. Standard of Indiana cau tions against premature en thusiasm and thus offers minor key counterpoint to sensation generating an nouncements by sources close to the Egyptian Government. Oil men with political savvy are convinced that Egypt is puffing so as to overcome potential objections by Libyan nationalists to the proposed Syrian‐Egyp tian‐Libyan union. The Libyans are among the most prosperous people in the world with oil production of close to 2 barrels of crude a day for each of its citizens. In 1970, Libya produced 3,321,000 barrels a day and its population was an esti mated 1,803,000 persons. Egypt, on the other hand, is one of the poorest of na tions and its oil treasure is at the wrong end of the Suez Canal— far from the Mediter ranean and this water avenue toward the key European markets. What's more, the southern find is of a high sulphur con tent, which generates air‐pol luting sulphur compounds and the oil is of low gravity. That is, it is heavy oil, a type that is difficult and costly to refine. Interestingly enough, the invading armies of Israel did not blow up the installation, although they could have. Presumably, the troops wanted to avoid a confronta tion with Standard and the United States. The Egyptians may have made points with the Lib yans with their new field since a major oil source in the western desert would be near the Mediterranean and would be higher quality oil —easily refined and with a low‐sulphur content; more like the Libyan product. The facts in all likelihood will have to await an end to the Arab Union negotiations unless Standard Oil of Indi ana has more to say. Stand ard of Indiana is trading near its year's high of 67¾. It closed yesterday un changed at 65⅞ on 13,100 shares. * He's an investor and he signs his name in red ink with an explanatory note, “I'm stain the red”. What annoys this investor —he requested anonymity— is that, as he said, “I find directors either serving or being proposed who don't own a single share of the company's stock, or just a token amount. “It makes me feel as though I've been had—if they're on the inside and don't have enough confidence to buy a few shares of stock, what am I doing there? “I realize, of course, that someone can perform a serv ice for the company without owning its stock, but I'd say it's poor public relations and demoralizing. “Take Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel, for example. Here's a company with a volume of more than $500‐million last year, yet its slate of directors lists one man with no shares, another with 100 a third with 101, and four others with no more than 200 shares of a stock selling around 15. “Maybe there's a good ex planation for this kind of sit uation; if so, I'd be interested in learning something. If not, it might make some corpora tion heads try to at least put up a better front. I guess I'd be less annoyed if I were ahead in my lousy invest ments.” This couldn't happen, in some other countries. For ex ample, no one can serve on a Canadian company's board unless he is a shareholder, al though the position required is minimal. The highest paid officers of American business all own substantial positions in their companies stock. In a list of the most highly compensated executives in the nation com piled by The Gallagher Presi dents' Report, Inc., there was not a single board chairman among the 33 most highly paid with fewer than 4,000 shares. Edwin H. Gott, chair man of the U. S. Steel Corporation, with just 4,000 shares owned the fewest. Charles G. Bluhdorn, chair man of Gulf & Western In dustries, owned the most stock in his own company with 418,000 shares. How ever, Thomas J. Watson Jr. of I.B.M. with 233,585 shares, had a bigger dollar position. Two of the highest paid corporation presidents owned fewer than a thousand shares. They were Edgar B. Speer, with 720 shares of the U. S. Steel Corporation and Lewis W. Foy, with 950 shares of Bethlehem Steel.

673-> Wheat Prices Rise, Spurred by Fears Of Drought Damage
Wheat futures advanced sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday but late profit‐taking halved the rise before the close of trading. The early rise was caused by fears that the Southwest's win ter wheat crop might have suffered irreparable damage because of the drought. Soybean oil prices were ir regular at the close but meal gained about 80 cents a ton. Iced broilers closed little changed after a session of mostly local and light dealings. Corn, oats and soybean fu tures also advanced in the early trading but, like wheat futures, came under profit‐taking late in the session. Buyers In the wheat pit far outnumbered sellers but when the July option advanced 2 cents, prices turned around. In the corn pit, prices held despite some bearish overtones result ing from reports that field pre paration was far ahead of last year. At the close of trading, wheat futures prices were unchanged to up 1 cent; corn, off ¼ to unchanged; oats, unchanged to up ⅛ cent; and soybeans, up ½ to off ⅝ cent a bushel. Silver futures, which had ad vanced the day before, dropped yesterday on the Commodity Exchange (Comex) here in fair ly active trading with 3,473 sales. The July contract, the busiest with 664 sales, fell to $17570 from $1.77 an ounce. The nearby May contract with 588 sales, dropped to $1.734 from $1.747 an ounce. The far July, with 150 sales, dipped to $1.894 from $1.906 an ounce the day before. Copper prices continued to rise, with the July contract, the busiest with 434 sales, climbing to 58.25 cents a pound from 157.85 cents on Wednesday. The September contract, with 152 sales, rose to 58.70 cents from 58.30 cents a pound the day before.

674-> RESERVE MEASURE GAINING IN SENATE
WASHINGTON, April 22— A subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee approved by a 5‐4 vote today the grant ing of authority to the Federal Reserve Board to set differing Reserve requirements against various types of bank loans and investments. This highly controversial measure, opposed by the Re serve Board, would put the na tion's central bank partly into the process of setting social priorities. The final outcome is still un certain. The full Banking Com mittee must vote on it and then, if the measure clears the Senate, it must survive a con ference with the House. The House bill to which the amend ment was attached contains no such provision. [Federal Reserve credit continued to expand at a rapid rate during the two‐ week period ended Wednes day.] The amendment was spon sored by Senator William Prox mire, Democrat of Wisconsin, chairman of the subcommittee. In today's vote, five Democrats, including Senator Proxmire, supported the amendment and three Republicans were joined by Senator John J. Sparkman, Democrat of Alabama, in oppo sition. Senator Sparkman is chairman of the full commit tee. Two Republican members of the subcommittee were absent when the vote was taken. Thus the outcome in the full com mittee is in doubt. The subcommittee also voted today to extend until Oct. 1 the President's standby authority to control wages and prices. The President has already used the authority to try to control construction wages. Today's amendment would permit application of the authority to a single industry only if price or wage increases in that industry were “grossly disproportionate” to the aver age for the economy as a whole. Construction, accord ing to committee sources, ap pears to meet that test. However, under provisions of both the House bill and the bill approved today, the authority applied by the Pres ident to construction wages would expire at the end of September unless Congress ex tends it. The basic to which the new Federal Reserve authority and the wage‐price control author ity were attached is no con troversial. It would extend for two more years the authority of the financial regulatory agencies to set ceilings on the interest rate that can be paid on time and savings deposits.

675-> Silverstein, Alone, in Program Of Unusual Violinistic Interest
Every other person entering Alice Tully Hall Monday night, It seemed, carried a fiddle case, a hint that something of more than passing violinistic interest. might be about to take place inside. The hint was correct: Joseph Silverstein, who has been the Boston Symphony's concertmaster for nine years, walked onstage alone and proceeded to play with extraordinary skill an entire program of unaccompanied works. Violinists don't often get the chance to hear anyone, let alone anyone of Mr. Silver stein's caliber, perform Johann Georg Pisendel's Sonata in A minor or Ysaye's solo sonatas. True, the Pisendel sounded rather tame tand pseudo‐Bachish, especially in light of the authentic Each that closed the program (the Partita in B minor), and the Ysaye Sonata No. 4 cut a somewhat narrow, though distinct, swath musically. But Mr. Silverstein went at each piece with the same high seriousness and technical command that made the Bach, with all its tiring repeats honored, impressive. Six Paganini Caprices received technically superb but also unusually thoughtful performances. In No. 2, where the labored left‐hand stretches and across‐the‐strings bowing forced a moderate pace, the violinist still kept the music moving and concentrated on delivering a rich, velvety tone. The buzzing scales and staccato of No. 5 were breathtaking, and in No. 6 the somber melody sang gorgeously through the steady tremolando. Mr. Silverstein summed up his Paganini expertise in No. 21, giving out the Kreislerish tune sweetly and letting go in the Presto section with a brilliant display of genuine staccato fiddling. Violinists who can play the Caprices well are not common, but those who can keep them from sounding sleazy are even rarer. Mr. Silverstein, who seemed to be sacrificing applause‐seeking bravura in order to maintatin accuracy and objectivity, proved one of the rare ones. Similarly, Seymour Shifrin's “Concert Piece” benefited mightily from the violinist's cool but musicianly approach to its problems. The cool style of the artist, in fact, extended even to his welcome decision to perform without formal coat, in a blue, ruffled shirt.

676-> Lunokhod's Adventure
MOSCOW, May 8 (UPI)—The Russians disclosed today that man and machine, separated by more than 200,000 miles, overcame the hostility of the alien moon when their robot exploring vehicle became stuck in crater. Boris Nepoklonov, chief operator of the Soviet vehicle, Lunokhod 1, described the accident in Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Communist Youth League's newspaper. While moving on the Sea of gains last month, Mr. Nepoklonov wrote, the wheeled Lunokhod crawled over the lip of a crafter and skidded down a steep slope of loose soil, becoming stuck in a cul‐de‐sac of boulders and loose soil. “We started taking it out. Loose soil was falling. The machine didn't climb, it kept sliding downward,” the engineer wrote. In a second attempt, the Lunokhod was rocked cautiously out of the dusty trap and climbed out of the crater.

677-> BURGLARY SUSPECT SLAIN BY POLICEMAN
A burglary suspect was shot and killed by a patrolman yesterday after he and the policeman struggled on the roof of a six‐story building. Patrolman William Spilett of the 13th Precinct responded to a report of a burglary at 132 East 35th Street yesterday with another officer, Patrolman Joseph Hamilton. As the two drove up, they said, they saw a man later identified as Mario Ortiz, 20 years old, of 431 East 15th Street, climbing up the fire escape to the roof. Patrolman Hamilton ran around to the back of the building and Patrolman Spilett, with his gun drawn, climbed up the, fire escape. He was unable to find the suspect on the roof and was on his way down when, he said, he Was jumped from behind. The two struggled, the policeman, said, and the suspect tried to push the patrolman over a three‐foot parapet, then started running down the fire escape. Patrolman Spilett pursued the suspect and shot him in the stomach. The wounded man crawled through an open window and died on the floor of the apartment.

678-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: This is in response to the travesty that happened on the beaches of Old Lyme as reported in The Times Aug. 31. It is not a question of whether the children were black or white, rich or poor. They were brought into an area uninvited. Not only did Mr. Coll in vade the privacy and consciences of peaceful citizens without warning, he also subjected countless children to a demeaning and (in some instances) traumatic experience. There is a large right here that must be understood, for it is the right of the sanctity of the home that is being ground under without our being aware of it. If people choose to live in a public park where there is no additional fee required, then they will ingly submit to so‐called “guests.” When a group of citizens, regardless of being more fortunate than others, are able to purchase for themselves the privilege of a private, clean and noise‐free environment, this should be upheld and acknowledged as their absolute right. More and more are the rights of those who have been forced to “buy” these, in order to preserve a sane island, being infringed upon while the “free hordes” (of any color) insist on the receipt of what they never earned, and less regard and justice is being given to the very people who have always supported the have‐nots. Let us ask, Rights for whom? For everybody. And leave emotion out of it. There is a tie‐in here, I think, with the countless loud and noisy concerts that have been mushrooming all over the city, causing untold discomfort to the residents by way of turned‐on cacophony. Invasions of thousands of adults occur, pouring through a com munity, leaving trails of parked and double‐parked cars everywhere. Until the early hours of the morning the deafening roars of their motorcycles as they depart after the concert keep the residents from a proper night's sleep. So, whether they be adults or chil dren disturbing the peace of certain adults, somehow there has to be a balance of rights, or we'll all tumble off the seesaw. New York, Aug. 31, 1971

679-> Stewart Triumphs in Ohio Can‐Am Race
LEXINGTON, Ohio, Aug. 22 —Jackie Stewart, the hard‐luck kid of the 1971 Can‐Am series, won a race today that was itself a hard‐luck derby—the Valvoline Can‐Am, 192 miles over the twisty Mid‐Ohio Sports Car Course. Stewart won because the two favored cars, a pair of Gulf McLaren‐Chevrolets driven by Peter Revson and Denis Hulme, dropped out. The Revson retirement was the more dramatic since he had held an unassailable lead from the start to the 72d lap, eight laps from the finish. Revson and Hulme were forced out with the same mechanical failure—broken drive shafts and the subsequent loss of brakes. Second Victory for Stewart It was a welcome victory for Stewart, who had failed to finish in three of the four previous Can‐Am races this season. He did win the one race he finished —on June 27 at Mont Tremblant, Quebec. Last Sunday Stewart clinched the world driving championship on the Grand Prix circuit. Not only did Stewart win today's $25,000 first prize by default — he was also racing under what amounted to protest. Jackie made no effort to chase Revson because he believed the rough surface of the 2.4‐mile track jeopardized’ his L&M Lola T260‐Chevrolet. When Revson broke down he was leading by 22 seconds, with only eight laps to go, and Stewart obviously had no chance to catch him. “The correct way,” Stewart said afterward, “was to stay within striking distance, waiting for something to happen. This worked out well for us.” Revson was credited with seventh place. Siffert Finishes 2d The race was the fifth of the $1‐million Canadian‐American Challenge Cup series of 10 races for Group 7 sport‐racing cars. Jo Siffert finished second, two laps behind, with his fiveliter Porsche 917‐10, outgunned by Stewart's 8‐liter Chevrolet. The other leaders were: Third, Tony Adamowicz in McLaren M8B; fourth, Herbert Mueller of Switzerland in a 5liter Ferrari, and fifth, Chuck Parsons in a Lola‐Chevrolet. The start of the race was theatrical, Hulme started from the pole. By the time he cornpleted the first turn, less than a thousand feet from the start line, he was through. Without brakes, Hulme spun. Half a dozen cars scrambled onto the grass to avoid hitting ‘him but Dave Causey had nowhere to go, and he clobbered the McLaren broadside. The race was a credit to Revson, who showed he could take the pressure of carrying the team burden alone. Stewart averaged 95,777 miles an hour for the 192 miles. The heat on the track was insufferable. Vic Elford, while lying fourth, retired with heat fatigue, Roger McCaig, Milt Minter and George Drolsom came into the pits just to be doused with pails of water.

680-> 2 Seized in Attack on Newsman At Newark School Unit Session
NEWARK, April 7—Two men, including Dr. E. Wyman Garrett, a former member of the school board, were arrested here tonight on charges stemming from the assault on a New York Times reporter during a school beard meeting last night. Earlier iri the day, Fox Butterfield, The New York Times's Newark caftespondont, filed report with the police saying that Dr. Garrett had ordered three men to assault him when he refused to turn over his notebook. Dr, Garrett, a 37‐year‐old gynecologist, and Roosevelt Gilbert, 31 were arrested after tonight's school board meeting on warrants signed by Mr. Butterfield. They were charged with interfering with or assaulting a reporter during the performance of his duties. Both will be arraigned tomorrow morning in Municipal Court. An angry crowd milled about the police and the arrested men in the foyer of Symphony Hall here. Mr. Butterfield told the police that at last night's meeting Dr. Garrett had said: “We're going to kiss you off, honky, and you better believe it.” Then three men grabbed him by the neck, puched him in the stomach and took his wallet and notebook, he said. The wallet was returned today without the $40 that had been in it. Mr. Butterfield also said that in response, to shouts from a crowd of blacks, a black policeman had turned his back while the assault continued. Arthur Gelb, metropolitan editor of The Times, filed a protest with Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson and, the Police Department. Mayor Gibson responded that he did not condone such violence, and said he would refer the matter to Police Director John L. Redden. Mr. Redden said: “We know all the police officers who were assigned to that detail. We have pictures of them. We'll give Mr. Butterfield an opportunity to identify the officer he says ignored his need. If we can run it down, we'll make an arrest and see what the patrolman's story is.” The, school board meeting was held to discuss ratification of a new contract to end the teachers’ strike here, which has entered its 10th week. The meeting, was crowded and tense, and the ratification motion was deferred when it became clear that not all the speakers could be heard last night. ACcording to Mr. Butterfield, Dr. Garrett asked for his notebook after he had written down a remark by Dr. Garrett to John Cervase, a white member of the school Doard. “Cervase, we know where you live,” Mr. Butterfield reported Dr. Garrett as saying. “We're going to get you. We're going to really get you.” The Times is providing Mr. Butterfield with legal counsel. State Senator James H. Wallwork, a Republican of Essex County, called the assault on Mr. Butterfield “a public outrage and a deliberate attempt to suppress news and intimidate reporters.” The Senator added: “It may well be that there are some people who do not want the truth to be told. However, well nformed citizenry is absolutely essential to a healthy democracy. “The Mayor of Newark has the obligation to see that every safeguard is taken to guarantee both the public's right to know and reporter's right to freegather the facts.”

681-> U.S. Rules Pig‐Iron Imports Are Sold Below Fair Value
WASHINGTON, March 16 (AP) — The Treasury Depart ment ruled today that pig iron imported from Canada, Finland and West Germany was being sold in the United States at less than fair value. The ruling means that the case will now be referred to the United States Tariff Com mission to determine if United States industries are being in jured as a result of pig‐iron imports. The Treasury said pig iron valued at $13.7‐million was im ported from Canada in 1970. From West Germany, im ports of the metal totaled only $8,500 last year.

683-> PENNSY WIDENS LOSS ESTIMATE
PHILADELPHIA, June 7— The Penn Central Transporta tion Company now estimates it will operate this year at a $240‐ million net loss, on a fully ac crued basis, making provision in its accounts for interest, taxes and other fixed charges that it is not now meeting. This is $52‐million greater than the trustees had estimated ear lier this year. The 1970 net loss was about $425‐million. “The economy is soft,” Wil liam H. Moore, president, said today. “It's been soft ever since I came here [last Sept. 11.” His remarks came at the end of a news conference held by the railroad‐operating company's trustees. “Revenues are way be low what we had forecast, with the result that we have up graded our estimates of our full year's loss from $188‐mil lion to $240‐million,” Mr. Moore said. Today's news conference which lasted an hour and 40 minutes, was the trustees' sec ond meeting with the press since their appointment last summer, following the Penn Central's bankruptcy petition on June 21. The trustees said the out look for the huge system “is brighter than it was” when Congress late last year guar anteed $100‐million of borrow ing for meeting payrolls. “The chances of ultimate re covery appear to be better,” the trustees said in a 3½‐page statement. It was read by Jervis Langdon Jr. on behalf of him self and the other trustees— George F. Baker, Richard C. Bond and Willard Wirtz. The question of whether the railroad can be reorganized at all, or even continue operating under a trusteeship, “depends in principal measure on what happens in one vital area, labor relations,” the trustees said in their statement. They said that in a few days they expected to open bargain ing negotiations with their op erating employes and to ask Congress to repeal the “full crew” laws. These laws, which began even before the Depression, have been ended by many states. (The most recent is New York.) But they are still in force in Ohio, where rail roads are required to operate with five‐man crews, and in Indiana, where a six‐man crew is mandatory. The Penn Central said that if it could go to three‐man crews for freight service, the standard in most states, the railroad could eliminate 8,900 employes. The trustees insisted they “would assure reasonable protection” for these employes in the form of severance pay. Mr. Moore said that savings from the move at present wage levels would be about half s million dollars a day, or $135‐ million annually. In addition to asking for re peal of the “full crew” laws, the trustees also propose to ask the Government to authorize the Federal District Court in Philadelphia to set up machin ery for final adjudication of crew disputes, including the long argument over having fire men on diesel engines. “We are not proposing a one‐ sided resolution,” the trustees said. But they did not indicate how far they were prepared to go in providing laid off em ployes with severance pay. The average Penn Central railroad worker—there were 91,995 of them on the payroll in mid‐May —is paid $12,500 a year. The Penn Central's president, Mr. Moore, said he expected to reduce the payroll to 85,000 workers this year. He said that 2,600 workers had been let go so far this year. With a three‐man crew on all its freight trains, he said, the Penn Central would need only 75,000 employes. The trustees said that if Con gress would put their legisla tive proposals (which include greater freedom in setting rates and abandoning trackage) into effect, further Government as sistance in financing the rail road beyond the $100‐million already obtained “hopefully could be avoided.” Even assuming the repeal of the crew laws and the rail road's not being required to keep firemen on diesels, $100 million more would be needed to meet payrolls and for ma terials and supplies until the company can make it on its own, the trustees said. They said they hoped to be able to generate this additional $100‐ million from internal sources. Each of the trustees swept aside questions about alterna tives they might consider if Congress does not provide the relief they propose. “There's just one right an swer,” said Mr. Wirtz with a tinge of impatience in his voice. “If it is not done [by Con gress], it presents a serious, serious crisis. We are playing it right down to the wire,” Mr. Wirtz insisted that na tionalization of the Penn Cen tral would not be the answer to the railroad's problems. He said he felt that Congress and the public would prefer giving the Penn Central the labor re lief it seeks to granting it an other Government‐guaranteed loan. Robert Blanchette, general counsel to the trustees, dis closed that they are about to ^nter several lawsuits brought derivatively by various parties on behalf of the debtor es tate (the bankrupt company) against the former manage ment of the railroad charging mismanagement.

684-> How to Shrink Housekeeping Chores
“Nobody Said You Had to Eat Off the Floor” is actually a book on housekeeping, but by the time you've giggled your way through the first two–thirds of it, you won't even mind. It not only offers a lot of useful, step‐by‐step informa tion about how to deal with the pollution problem in your own living room, but it also explains why you may be so hung up that you can't keep your house clean even if you know how. As a matter of fact, it is subtitled “The Psychiatrist's Wife's Guide to Housekeep ing.” In it, Carol Eisen demonstrates that enough in formation has been transmit ted in the course of the connubial relationship with her headshrinking husband to help her take a whack at ex plaining how the dark forces at the top of the mental stairs can turn you into a quivering mass of ineptitude at the mere sight of a dust mop. Not that it started out that way. Some friends of the author suggested a while ago that a good way to make a quick buck was to write a nice, solid book on house keeping. Miss Eisen admits she is very fond of money, quick or otherwise, and since it seemed a simple matter of collating lots of housekeeping books and writing a better one, she took the project on. At about the same time, she was coping with two small children, Michael and Jane, who are now 5 and 2 respectively, a husband, a fair‐sized apartment on the Upper East Side done in Eng lish period furnishings, a three‐day‐a‐week job in pub lishing and occasional free lance articles. As time went on, she found herself beginning to feel guilty about what she was sure was gross neglect of her husband, children, the conk (“I spent at least three months obsessively transfer ring information to 3‐by‐5 index cards when I should have been writing”), and, of course, total negligence when it came to her house. “I was convinced that it constantly looked as if 15 ber serk Turks had run through the place searching for a pinch of heroin,” she said yesterday. Looking back now in the serene state of having left the part‐time job and being about to collect royalties on the book, she is convinced that this was just a personal projection, and that she wasn't negligent at all. But at the time, it gave her the idea for the psy chiatric housekeeping book. Why not, she thought, parlay her neuroses into something creative (roughly known as sublimating). Why not draw on her own experiences (“It's probably the only autobiog raphy that's ever been writ ten in the form of a house keeping book”) and give other guilt‐ridden housewives the benefit of her insights? “So at one point last sum mer,” said Miss Eisen, “I asked my husband to tell me everything there was to know about psychiatry. In one afternoon.” Miss Eisen's authority and support, who declines to be identified because he doesn't want to be known as “the psychiatrist's wife's hus band,” nor be held respon sible for the theories his wife evolved, agreed to help. “I told her everything I knew as comprehensively as I could, and I guess whatever stuck is the book,” he said, as he stepped into the gleam ing study for a moment, be fore going off to a class. “I spent this past week end overloading the circuits,” Miss Eisen mused (see sec tion entitled, “Rule One: Don't Do Too Much”) “and doing all the things I said people shouldn't do. “I was supposed to be writing a piece for Life mag azine, and I spent the whole weekend going around neu rotically and obsessively cleaning my house. “I knew you weren't really going to look behind my cur tains for dust or check to see if the ice cubes in the trays were even, but I kept doing it anyway,” she told a visitor. “And you were supposed to say,” she called after the departing figure of her hus band, “I've never seen the house in such a mess!” Ideally, of course, the book, which is published by David McKay Company and costs $6.95, will make Miss Eisen rich enough to afford a full‐time maid, and thus re strict her guilt prickles to the problem of being a slave owner (see chapter on hang ups about having a maid). Right now, however, she contents herself with a three‐ day‐a‐week baby sitter, who also tidies up, while she spends part of a couple of mornings a week getting at the grime, sorting laundry and so forth. What about women's lib and the new woman? Well, she says she doesn't feel she's “being an Aunt Tom” by writing a book that puts the woman squarely be hind the dust cloth and the man airily free of anything more domestic than mixing the martinis. “People of my age—I'm 29 —who are middle class were brought up with the big role thing: that it's the woman's job to take care of home and children, and I think this is awfully hard to break. “It's just my pragmatism,” she said.

685-> 4 AFRICAN LEADERS END TALKS IN CAIRO
CAIRO, Nov. 8—A delegation of four African presidents left Cairo today after three days of consultations with President Anwar el‐Sadat and other officials on issues obstructing a settlement of the EgyptianIsraeli conflict. The presidents are to report in Dakar, Senegal, to a 10‐nation committee on the Middle Eastern crisis set up last summer by the Organization of African Unity. They are Léopold Sédar Senghor of Senegal, Gen. Joseph D. Mobutu of Zaire (formerly the Congo), Ahmadou Ahidjo of Cameroon and Maj. Gen, Yakubu Gowon of Nigeria. Few details of the talks here have been made public, but there were indications that Egypt had held to previously announced terms for a settlement. A return trip to Israel and Egypt by the four presidents, or at least Mr. Senghor, the chairman, is considered likely after discussion in Dakar of their findings. The Africans are not acting as mediators but rather are seeking to clarity positions. In particular, they focused questions here on the nature of the peace that would follow, a settlement, including, security guarantees, borders, demilitarized zones and freedom of shipping through the Suez Canal.

686-> Surtax Seen as a Threat To Airlines and Port Here
New York's Economic Development Administrator said yesterday that President Nixon's new economic measures might cause serious “hurt” to the city's maritime and aviation industries. Ken Patton, who heads the city's business agency, said that the 10 per cent surtax on imports could result in an annual loss of $20‐million in waterfront‐related payrolls and the layoff of several thousand workers. “That would depend on whether the new economic policies are continued for any length of time,” he added. While estimating that the over‐all impact of the new policies “is going to be good,” Mr. Patton Predicted that the policies would help cities in the Middle West more than those on the East and West Coasts, which depend on foreign trade. Protection to Hurt “We import 11 million tons of cargo through the Port of New York, and the measures that are taken to protect domestic industry are going to hurt our port industries,” Mr. Patton said. He added: “We could lose about 20 per cent of our tonnage through New York, which could really mean a very serious prolongation of an existing slump in export cargoes. That could cost approximately $20‐million in payrolls in New York City or the loss of several thousand jobs.” Mr. Patton said he was also concerned about possible serious harm to the airlines here if the dollar became devalued and tourism declined. “You have to realize that 70 per cent of the traffic out of Kennedy International Airport are Americans going overseas for pleasure,” he said. “Only 25 or so per cent are Europeans coming to America.” Mr. Patton said the President's new economic policies might add 15,000 to 20,000 jobs related to domestic industries here. “But one area that is not likely to pick up is the airport area, where people are already out on furlough because of the slump in international tourism,” he said. ‘Newsmakers’ Interview Mr. Patton expressed his views on the Columbia Broadcasting System's “Newsmakers” television program and in an interview afterward. He said that the 10 per cent investment credit proposed by Mr. Nixon would not do much good in New York City, because there were not many heavy industries here. In a related development, Mayor Lindsay devoted his television program on Station WNEW‐TV last night to the effect of the new economic policy on New York. His budget director, Edward K. Hamilton, contended that any loss to the city caused by the curtailment of imports would be offset by an improvement in exports as a result of devaluation. One of the Mayor's guests, Prof. Charles Schultz of the University of Maryland, said the import surtax was regarded as a bargaining measure to be imposed only while new levels of exchange rates were worked out. But Mr. Lindsay said it could be regarded as a concession to protectionists in Congress and might not be shortlived.

687-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: Frank Dressler, executive director of the Tocks Island Regional Advisory Council, inadvertently compounds the public's confusion when he fails to state clearly in his recent letter that there are two projects involved in the Delaware Valley controversy. One is the Delaware Water Gap Na tional Recreational Area; the other is the Tocks Island Dam project. These are separate projects. It would seem that the public relations efforts of the proponents of the Tocks Island Dam have been successful in making the recreational area disappear into the smaller Tocks Island project—a classic example of the fly swallowing the camel. The opponents of the Tocks Island Dam project are not opposed to the creation of a national park in the Del aware Valley. They—and I am proud to join them in their persistence—are against constructing a dam across the Delaware Valley. Such a dam will flood thousands of acres of rich al luvial farm land, and worse, alter for ever the contours and shape of the Delaware Valley. There is little opposition to the no tion that the recreational area is so??e ly needed by a burgeoning population. There is opposition to the damming of the Delaware River and Valley. I should like very much for Mr. Dressler and the Tocks Island Regional Advisory Council (I am a card‐carry ing citizen member) to join the propo nents in eliminating the dam from the Tocks Island Dam project. The acreage of the Tocks Island project is necessary but the dam is neither necessary nor wanted by the residents of Monroe and Pike Coun ties. At best, the idea to dam the his toric Delaware Valley has become an obscene reality. Marshall Creek, Pa., Aug. 22, 1971

688-> Laird, Home, Hopeful on Vietnam
WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 (AP) —Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird returned today from his three‐day visit to Saigon with an optimistic assessment of the Vietnamization program and a recommendation for President Nixon further withdrawals of soldiers from Vietnam. The South Vietnamese may not win every battle, Mr. Laird mid, “but they are in a position where they are strong militarily and they can handle the military situation to an extent that I did not think was possible when this program started.” At a news conference at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, the Secretary said that Vietnamization, the Administration's program of withdrawing United States forces and turning the conduct of the war over to the South Vietnamese, is “on schedule or ahead of schedule in all respects.” Although Mr. Laird declined to discuss what he would recommend to the President, Pentagon aides said they believed his optimistic report would set the stage for a further significant reduction in troop strength when the President makes his announcement next week.

689-> Peking Says Nixon's New Policy Places Burden on the Workers
HONG KONG, Aug. 22—Commenting today for the first time on President Nixon's new economic policies, Peking called them “reactionary measures shifting the financial and economic crisis onto the workers.” A Peking dispatch received here from Hsinhua, the Chinese Communist press agency, described the President's steps as actions “taken by United States monopoly circles who are already beset with difficulties at home and abroad.” The dispatch contained no personal reference to Mr. Nixon The economic steps taken by the President were simply referred to as Government measures. Peking continues to condemn United States policies and actions, but since early this year has ceased attacking President Nixon personally. Attacks on the President were formerly almost weekly occurrences. With President Nixon soon to be a state visitor to the People's Republic, its Government has obviously decided that it would be improper to make him the personal target of an attack. Today's Hsinhua comments on Mr. Nixon's new economic measures were made in the context of a report on the strike by West Coast longshoremen and other American strikes. The West Coast longshoremen were praised for refusing to abandon their strike. “Their strike has dealt heavy blows to the United States monopoly capitalists,” Hsinhua said, “and marks the new awakening and mighty fighting strength of the American working class.” The press agency reported that 150,000 workers were currently involved in 363 stoppages in the United States and said that new strikes were planned to combat the Government's wage‐price freeze. The People's Republic of China, with its system of state trading, has not been affected by changes in currency exchange rates resulting from President Nixon's new policy. The Chinese currency, the yuan, is held by the Government to a 2.4 rate against the United States dollar and to relevant rates against other currencies. Peking has maintained that the yuan is the most stable currency in the world. For the last year or more, the Chinese have tried to have all trade with the People's Republic settled in Chinese rather than foreign currencies but is reported to have accepted some settlements in yen, sterling and francs.

690-> Foundation Offers Hope To Children Near Death
Sixteen years ago, Frank J. Ficarra had a butcher shop in Brooklyn. Across the street was a fish store owned by Joseph Caltabiano. They were both merchants and both of Italian descent, but it was something much more per sonal that drew then togeth er. Their children had thal assemia major, more com monly known as Cooley's Anemia. The disease, which primar ily affects people of Mediter ranean descent, is incurable and usually fatal, a fact that the Ficarras and Caltabianos has accepted, but the costs were exorbitant. The Ficarras had two chil dren afflicted with the dis ease and the Caltabianos had one. Each child required transfusions of blood every two to four weeks and it cost $35 a pint in 1954. The three children are dead, as is Mr. Ficarra, who had a heart attack, but the work started by these two families, along with five others they had met in hos pitals, is providing hope for thousands of children with Cooley's Anemia. Since its birth in Brook lyn, the organization started by these families, the Cool ey's Anemia Blood and Re search Foundation for Chil dren, has awarded thousands of dollars for medical re search into the disease, has sponsored blood drives to lighten the financial burden on the families and has held two seminars on Cooley's Anemia to enable physicians from around the world to ex change information on the disease. Tomorrow, the foundation, which has grown to thou sands of members with chap ters or branches in Brooklyn, Staten Island, Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester and in Southern California, Illinois, Pennsylvania New Jersey and the Southern states, will offi cially begin its annual fund drive with a goal of $250,000. Some advances have been made. In 1930, five years af ter Dr. Thomas B. Cooley of Detroit identified the disease, the life expectancy of a child with Cooley's Anemia was little more than ayear. Today, it is more than 20 years. Edward D. Paradiso, na tional president of the foun dation, which has headquar ters in New Hyde Park, L. I., said that in addition to the medical advances that have been made the big difference between today and 1954 was that more information about the disease is available. “It was very difficult for parents to make decisions then,” he said. The great danger, in the view of Lawrence Rosano, president of the Long Island chapter, is that interest in the disease will wane and that it will spring up again in unexpected places. Mrs. Ann Freedman, execu tive director of the founda tion, stressed Mr. Rosano's point that Cooley's Anemia could not be considered re stricted to any one ethnic group when she recalled meeting a young boy suffer ing from the disease who had red hair, freckles and a thor oughly Irish name. The severe form of the dis ease is called thalassemia major. A child afflicted with this form is handicapped to the extent that he cannot en gage in strenuous physical activities. Another form of the disease is thalassemia minor, which has little or no effect on the carrier. At present, there are 100, 000 children in the United States, including 700 in the New York metropolitan area, with thalassemia major in the United States as well as hundreds of thousands else where in the world. The word thalassemia comes from the Greek thalassa, meaning sea. Dr. Edward C. Zaino, chair man of the advisory com mittee of the foundation, said that while there was no cure in sight at present for the severe form of the dis ease, progress has been made. Dr. Zaino, who is affiliated with Meadowbrook Hospital in East Meadow and Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, said that one problem is that the transfusions create excess amounts of iron and that they are now working on ways to break down this iron, which collects in the liver, heart, pancreas and other organs.

691-> Cambodian Ships Get Through
PNOMPENH, Cambodia, April 1 (Reuters) — A Cambo dian convoy sailed into port here today with important sup plies of petroleum and ammu nition after having been de layed for two days by Vietcong gunners. The convoy made up of freighter and two barges dropped anchor for two nights in southeast of here while South Vietnamese‐Cambodian force, aided by United States air support, routed a Vietcong battalion on the east bank of the river, about eight miles from the capital. The Mekong has become the most important supply route for the Cambodians since en emy forces cut the Pich Nil Pass on Route 4 linking Pnom penh to Kompong Som, Cam bodia's only newspaper port.

692-> Sports of The Times
In a cool white room of clicks and hums, at precisely 11:41:37 yesterday morning, the IBM 360 on the left wrote: “Waiting for Work.” The IBM 360 on the right, its associate, blinked 20 glass eyes and a man swallowed unnecessarily, and then it was 11:42:45 and the IBM 360 on the left wrote: “Job 20 is purged.” The man, intimidated by the self‐assurance of the machines, said, “Could you say they're talking to each other?” Barry Mindes, Offtrack Betting's vice president of Engineering, offered a technician's smile, friendly but contemptuous, and replied, “You could say they're talking to each other.” “What are they saying?” “These are very complex, sophisticated systems and their problems are subtle ones,” said Mindes, his eyes glazed with machine‐love. “Also, we're working with public money here, and there are a lot of emotions involved. It's not though we're issuing airline tickets.” The man pointed at a sign on the computer: Do Not Power Off EVer!! “What happens if you pull the plug?” “It would lose memory.” Mindes smiled, the patient smile of the articulate technician who wants to allay the fear of man for machine, of soft for hard. After awhile, he said: “Basically, computers are dumb. They can't give you good answers unless you ask them good questions. It reminds me of the classic story. Ford asked its computers the public would buy a medium‐priced car, and the computers Said, Yes. But they should have asked, would the public buy the Edsel. So you see, it's still all human judgment.” The man appeared more agitated. “Of course, I see. That's what's bothering me, I trust the machines.” The man had just come down three flights in the Paramount Building from Howard Samuels's final briefing before the opening of OTB. Samuels has held many news conferences, briefings, informal chats, and he has perfected a role as a very candid, very amiable, very earnest man eager to laugh at himself but ready to kick down brick walls if necessary to fulfill his mission to the public. He often starts, as he did yesterday, with “the public hopefully will not expect too much too soon from OTB,” and escalates almost immediately to “by 1973, even without sports betting, we'll be doing one billion dollars a year, and we'll one of the top 50 corporations in the nation.” Later, as the $1. billion becomes a conversational currency, shirt‐sleeved aides will explain that it represents handle, or total money wagered, not profits. If OTB is truly successful its impact upon sports will be enormous: All games will exist as elaborate, roulette wheels, and much of society will be pacified by this ingenious circus of hopes. But there is no reason to believe that Samuels is involved in such ultimate conspiracy; even among the non‐techs at OTB the dreams are drowned hums and clicks. OTB will work, they say; it is a matter of marketing and locations and surveys. An ad reads: “Start a new morning routine: coffee, doughnut and the daily double.” What, are you one of those de‐ethnicized liberals who doesn't bet numbers, doesn't think government should turn people on to gambling, doesn't realize that illegal betting is the treasury of organized crime? Be realistic, they say. Should it all fail, the hums and clicks seem to say, the fault will not be in our readouts but in the quality of the opposition—organized crime, unions, public indifference. At least it will not have been in vain: You will have had the chance to meet Howard Samuels (notice, we no longer say Howie the Horse) and, in another race some November you might bet on him. The IBM 360 on the left, and its associate, will not be ready for today's opening, which, says Samuels, will make no difference to the customers up front; in fact, it might faster this semi‐automatic way. And none of it matters anyway: “We are not going to solve the problems of the city, how could we even expect to if there are $150‐million settlements to the uniformed services?” Samuels smiles. Hums. Clicks.

693-> Texas Banker Put on ProbationIn Case That Shook Politicians
HOUSTON, June 14 (AP)—Frank Sharp, whose bank loan and stock deals shook the highest echelons of Texas government earlier this year, walked free from a Federal courtroom today on his promise to belave for three years. Sharp had pleaded guilty in a morning session before his afternoon sentencing. Federal District Judge John V. Singleton placed the promoter and former banker on three years’ probation and fined him $5,000 on charges of making; false entries in his now‐defunct Sharpstown State Bank and of selling unregistered stocks. Knowle dgeable sources had been predicting that Sharp would receive such treatment in court in return for testifying against the other principals in the loan and stock deals. He could have been given a total of 10 years in prison and fined $10,000, or both. Called Manipulator The scandals were set off when the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil suit against 13 companies and 15 individuals seeking an injunction to stop them from any fraud and stock manipulation. The suit filed Jan. 18 and accompanying depositions pointed'’ to Sharp as the manipulator who allowed key politicians borrow large sums of money from his bank to buy stocks in his National Bankers Life Insurance Company and then, sell for large, quick profits. It further accused. Sharp of manipulating the records and accounts of the Jesuit Fathers of Houston, Inc., resulting in huge losses. Jesuit spokesmen say Sharp may have bilked the order of $8.5‐million. The S.E.C. did not name any current political figure in its civil suit, but the extensive depositions are, threaded with their names. The Federal agency said Sharp made’ the deals with the politicians in an effort to get banking legislation he wanted. The Sharp bills sailed through the Legislature, only, tobe vetoed by Gov. Preston Smith, who made $62,500 out of Sharp's deals. Dr. Elmer Baum, Texas Democratic party chairman and Governor Smith's financial adviser, made another $62,500. None of the politicians has been named defendants in any civil or criminal action.

694-> Tito's Hand Seen in Expulsion of 2 Croatian Nationalists From Communist Party
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, July 24—The expulsion yesterday of two leading Croatian national ists from the Communist party is viewed here as a result of intervention by President Tito to squelch a separatist move ment among intellectuals and students in Yugoslavia's sec ond largest republic. The unanimous decision of a special meeting of the Zagreb Communist party conference to expel Profs. Sime Djodan, 431 years old, and Marko Veselica, 35, came less than three weeks after President Tito held an un usual Sunday meeting with Croatian party leaders there. One speaker referred yesterday to rumors of presidential inter ference but maintained that Croas were capable of correct ing their own faults without outside prodding. Despite this disclaimer, the expulsion of the two spokesmen for Croatian nationalism — the first such action since three advocates of linguistic separa tism were stripped of party membership in April, 1967—is seen as fulfilling a pledge made by President Tito April 15. In a speech he denounced party leaders who “violate unity al though they speak in favor of it.” and he pledged the ouster of those whose actions “de stroy our community.” Professors Djodan and Ve selica, both political econo mists, have been leaders of a spreading movement in Croatia for more political and cultural autonomy. They had been par ticularly critical of the esti mated half million Serbs living with the four million Croats and accused them of attempting to keep the Croats in a colonial relationship to Serbia, Yugo slavia's largest republic. Before President Tito's stern speech in April, Croatian party leaders seemed to be tolerating lower‐level separatist activity. Now, Croatia appears to be making amends. Draft consti tutional changes made public last week give new guarantees to the Serbian minority in Croatia. And in Belgrade, university professors who called for re vising Serbia's boundaries to incorporate Croatian territory inhabited by Serbs have not been publicly reprimanded. Pa pers carrying their statements were banned, but the Commu nist party here has taken no action against them. In Croatia, it is thought that the expulsion yesterday may be only the first act in a drive against nationalist extremists that could reach the top of the party hierarchy.

697-> The Eve of the Bluing of America
A considerable number of American intellectuals have been on a kick of revolution talk for the last few years. It began in a left mood, with fantasies of political revolution colored red or black. The mood now appears to have shifted somewhat. The fantasies have shifted to cultural revolution, which, we are told, will color America green. What the two varieties of revolution talk have in common is a sublime dis regard for the requirements of techno logical society and for the realities of power and class in America. To be sure, drastic (if you like, “revolution ary”) things are happening in this so ciety, but the currently fashionable in terpretations only serve to obfuscate them. It is conceivable that technological society will collapse in America. In that case, as grass grows over the computers, we would revert to the ways of an underdeveloped country. Conceivable, yes; probable, no. The more likely assumption is that techno logical society will continue. If so, who will run it? We would venture, first, a negative answer: It will not be the people engaged in the currently cele brated cultural revolutions. The “greening” revolution is not tak ing place in a sociological vacuum, but has a specific location in a society that is organized in social classes. There are enough data now to pinpoint this location. The cadres of the revolution are, in overwhelming pro portions, the college‐educated children of the upper middle class. Ethnically, they tend to be Wasps and Jews. Ideo logically, they are in revolt against the values of this class—which is precisely the class that has been running the technological society so far. But the essentially bucolic rhetoric of this re bellion goes far beyond a radical (in the leftist sense) rejection of American class society and its allegedly evil ways. The rhetoric intends a dropping out of technological society as such. The matrix of this revolution has been the youth culture. What are the prospects for the children of the peo ple of the emerging counterculture? We don't want to speculate in detail about the probable career of the son of a dropped‐out sandal maker in Bella Vista—except for the suggestion that he is unlikely to make it to the upper middle‐class status of his grandfather. In sociological parlance, he is probably headed for downward social mobility. The black revolution, for quite dif ferent reasons, is also headed for a counter or subculture, segregated from the opportunity system of technolog ical society and subsidized through political patronage. The prospects here are for segregated social mobility. This may have its own cultural or ideolog ical satisfactions. But upward mobility in a black (“community controlled”) educational bureaucracy Is unlikely to lead to positions of power and privi lege in the enveloping technological society. If the “greening” revolution will in fact continue to lure sizable numbers of upper‐middle‐class individuals out of “the system,” and if the black rev olution will succeed in arresting out ward mobility among its adherents, a simple but decisively important devel opment will take place: There will be new “room at the top.” Who is most likely to take advantage of this socio logical windfall? It will be the newly college‐educated children of the white lower middle and working classes (and possibly those nonwhites who will re fuse to stay within the resegregated racial subcultures). In other words, precisely those classes that remain most untouched by what is considered to be the revolutionary tide in contem porary America face new, prospects of upward social mobility. A technological society, given a cli mate of reasonable tolerance, can af ford sizable regiments of sandal mak ers and Swahili teachers. It must have quite different people, though, to oc cupy its command posts and to keep its engines running. These will have to be people retaining the essentials of the old Protestant ethic—discipline, achievement orientation and, last not least, a measure of freedom from gnawing self‐doubt. If such people are no longer avail able in one population reservoir, an other reservoir will have to be thrilled. There Is no reason to think that “the system.” will be unable to make the necessary accommodations. Should Yale become hopelessly “greened,” Wall Street will get used to recruits from Fordham or Wichita State. Italians or Southern Baptists will have no trou ble running the Rand Corporation. It is even possible that the White House may soon have its first Polish occu pant (or, in a slightly different sce nario, its first Greek). There Is one proviso—namely, that the children of these classes remain relatively unbitten by the “greening” bug. If they, too, should drop out, there would literally be no one left to mind the technological store. So far, the evidence does not point in this direction. Indeed, what evidence we have of the dynamics of class in a number of European countries would indicate that the American case is not all that unique. Both England and West Ger many have undergone very similar changes in their class structures, with new reservoirs of lower‐middle‐class and working‐class populations supply ing the personnel requirements of a technological society no longer serv iced by the old elites. The aforementioned process is not new in history. It is what Vilfredo Pareto (that most neglected of classi cal sociologists) called the “circulation of élites.” Even Marx, albeit in the most ironical manner, may be proved right in the end. It may, indeed, be the blue‐collar masses that are, at last, coming into their own. “Power to the people!”—nothing less than that., The class struggle may be approaching a decisive new phase, with the children of the working class victorious—under the sign of the American flag. In that perspective, alas, the peace emblem represents the decline of the bour geois enemy class, aptly symbolizing its defeat before a more robust adver sary. This would not be the first time in history that the principals in the societal drama are unaware of the con sequences of their actions. “Revolutionary” America? Perhaps. We may be on the eve of its bluing.

699-> Does Any body Have Fun on Campus Any More? It's All Matter of Relativity
When the alumni returned to Bethel College in McKen zie, Tenn., for homecoming this year, they were im pressed by the new field house, awed by the new fine arts buildings and rather puzzled by the students on the trim, tiny campus. “I don't know what it is exactly,” conceded a dentist from Florida who was gradu ated in 1956, “but they just don't seem to be enjoying themselves as much as we did.” This opinion is shared by millions of old grads from all across the country. Compared with their recollections of campus lire, going to college these days is about as much fun as a bear market, or in come tax. But the students at Bethel and in other schools vigor ously disagree. Some sneer. “That's just more trash about kids,” com plained a sophomore coed be tween classes at Bethel. “They're so up tight about what they've done to the world, they express their guilt in terms of their children's so‐called Sadness.” Others, with considerable hostility, respond philosophi cally. “It's all a matter of terms,” reasoned a senior at Indiana University. “The defi nition of pleasure is relative to the person seeking it of enjoying it.” But however they may ex press their disagreement, the students unanimously insist that their pursuit of hap piness is equally as fruitful, if not more, than those of generations before them. It is, at times, indubitably different. At the University of Illi nois, for instance, the den of a large fraternity house was expensively and elaborately prepared earlier this year for one member's date with his fiancee Sensitive microphones were planted strategically around the room and the couple's rendezvous, down to their breathing, was repro duced stereophonically for the benefit of his brothers gathered in an upstairs bed room. Most members of the au dience readily agreed that their prank was considcrably more fun than swallowing goldfish. Coeds living in a high‐rise dormitory at Mississippi Southern University in Hat tiesburg hung a tape recorder out a window and, in the wee hours of the morning, startled the campus police with blood curdling shrieks and screams, all recorded earlier in the day. The policemen scurried around the building search ing unsuccessfully for a vic tim or an assailant, and the girls finally went to sleep smiling. At the University of Texas, two freshman baseball play ers read about demonstra tions by homosexuals in New York City and went about the campus the next day holding hands, and with straight faces, informing the instructors that they were “in love.” A dean later carefully ex plained to them that, al though there were no specific rules about “this sort of thing,” it would not be best for them to express their af fections for one another pub Ecly. When the dean learned it was a joke, he did not laugh. The boys and most of their friends did. Generally though on Amer ican campuses there appears to be a declining interest in pranks and a waning popu larity in such competitive fun as cramming great numbers of young people into small, foreign cars or telephone booths. “I think there's a certain kind of honesty in what we do for fun these days,” a senior history major at Duke University said. “People do what they feel they want to do, sometimes in groups, sometimes alone, but it's al ways what they feel they'd like to do.” Whatever they do, he con tinued, is most usually nothing more than a response to “the urges of youth to be young, which is how I believe Shakespeare, one of the older generation, said it.” This thesis was echoed by a Harvard junior who con tended: “Although there are some striking differences in the di versions of this generation than previous ones, there are probably more similarities than people recognize.” Among them, he said, are music for entertainment and dancing, conversation, sports, the theater (mostly films) and “whatever else is recogniz ably different from the scho lastic regimen.” He conceded that the mu sic is different than that en joyed by his parents and theirs, adding, “and as a re sult, so is the dancing. But it's still rhythm and body movement, so who's going to make anything about that?” Bull sessions, if anything, appear to be even more popu lar these days under a dif ferent name, “rapping.” The subject of conversations have changed, to be sure, but the themes remain constant: what's wrong and what's right, and who's wrong and who's right. “And the verdict, I think, is still the same,” said a junior student at Coe Col lege in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “My dad told me that when he was a kid, they talked about what a mess the older people were making and how great it would be if the stu dents could have some power in the world.” Occasionally, however, the youngsters’ distaste for the authority vested in the older generation can lead to prob lems. In a small, Oregon college, for instance, a group of stu dents decided to stage a mock “pot party” and arranged to make certain that campus po lice knew about it. “Marijuana is very much of a problem here,” one of party's planners later ex plained. “All we wanted to do was just bug the cops.” It worked. More than a dozen of students were ar rested, charged and convict ed of possession of the drug and, only after all of them had called their parents and hired lawyers was It shown that the party had indeed been just a put‐on. A lab report finally showed that they were smoking hon est‐to‐goodness “grass” of the lawn and garden variety, dried and rolled into ciga rette papers.

700-> Growth Is Issue in Riverhead
RIVERHEAD, L. I. — Ex pansion of this largely agri cultural town seems to be shaping up as the major is sue in the race for Super visor. The Republicans appear to have the edge with a registration of 2,820, while the Democrats have 1,563 en rolled and the Conservatives 149. In the race for Supervisor, the Republican incumbent, Bruno Zaloga, a former Town Justice, is seeking re election on Nov. 2 to his second full two‐year term. The Democratic candidate is John H. Leonard, a retired Post Office employe, while the Conservative nominee is Carl Stagg, a retired radio electronics technician. Mr. Zaloga said he was planning for the future of the token by having an eight‐ year‐old master plan up dated to fit the town's cur rent needs and by trying to “entice good, light industry to offset unemployment.” Preparation for the “good and orderly development of the Town of Riverhead” is the prime issue, he said. In response, Mr. Leonard said that he was for undat ing of the master plan but that over the last eight years “it could have been used more than it was—it cost quite a bit of money to set up.” “According to the plan, 31 per cent of the town's area is allotted for industry but there's none here,” he said. “Apparently, they have not been trying too hard to get industry here. We have the space for industry and we need it but there isn't any.” Mr. Stagg said that it is important to maintain the rural atmosphere of the town but that “it is about time the Town Board take a good, hard look at itself and de cide what it is going to do about planning one way or the other.” There also are races in Riverhead for Town Council man and Town Justice. The key election issue in the Town of Southold, adja cent to Riverhead on the North fork, also seems to locus on the urbanization of a rural town that counts agriculture and tourism as its main industries. In the race for Town Su pervisor, Albert M. Marto chia, the Republican incum bent and former chairman of the town's Board of As sessors, is seeking re‐election to another two‐year term. His Democratic., opponent is William H. Grigonis, presi dent of the Southold School Board for the last four years. The Conservative candidate is Stanley J. Waimey, a re tired captain of the New York City Fire Department who is now serving on the New Suffolk School Board. Bunning on the Liberal. slate is Joseph P. Sullivan, a geography professor at Southampton College. The Republicans enjoy registration lead of 5,451 to 1,737 for the Democrats. The Conservatives have 153 and the Liberals 35. Mr. Martocchia said that the major issue in the cam paign was planning for the expansion of the community. He said this would be ac complished by the adoption of the master plan, which would emphasize the build ing up of farming and tour ism over the next 15 years. Mr. Grigonis countered by saying the town administra tion had acted too slowly in implementing its plans for the community. “It took them seven years to enact a new master plan. It should have been done three or four years ago,” he said. Mr. Waimey said he felt the administration did not seem to be planning for the future. Mr. Sullivan stated that he thought his knowledge of geography made him unique ly qualified to handle the environmental problems that will occur in the future. Other Southold races are for Town Council and Town Justice.

701-> House Votes Aid Bill as Spur to Senate
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8—A foreign aid appropriation bill that would provide $2.67‐billion in economic and military assistance was passed by the Houe of Representatives today by a vote of 214 to 179. The House acted as legislation that would authorize an appropriation remained deadlocked in a joint House‐Senate conference committee. The move was a tactical one, intended to apply pressure on the Senate for action to get around the Impasse on foreign aid and facilitate the adjournment of Congress by the weekend. There were indications following passage of the appropriations measure that the authorization bill might be freed from the present deadlock. Representative Thomas E. Morgan of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House conferees, said he would communicate tomorrow with the leader of the Senate conferees, J. W. Fulbright of Arkansas, on the possibility of resuming negotiations. Meanwhile, with temporary spending authority for foreign aid due to expire at midnight tonight, Congressional leaders agreed to seek still another extension through a continuing resolution in the event the impasse on the authorization measure remained unbroken. House leaders, including Representative George Mahon of Texas, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, set the stage for House adoption of a resolution that would extend foreign aid spending authority to next March 15. It would be the fifth extension of foreign aid spending authority in the current fiscal year, which began last July 1. The authorizing legislation, which would establish money ceilings and fix policies governing administration of the aid program during the current fiscal year, has been deadlocked, in the House‐Senate conference committee since last week. At the basis of the deadlock is an amendment sponsored by Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana, the Senate majority leader, that would require withdrawal of all United States troops from Indochina within six months of the bill's enactment, if all American and allied prisoners of war are released. by then. Mr. Mansfield told the conference committee last Friday that he would rather see the foreign aid program die than accept any modification of his amendment. His position on this issue was unchanged after the House vote. But ht, talking with newsmen, Mr. Mansfield said that he would vote against a continuing resolution for foreign aid. When a reporter suggested that this meant he would not try to prevent its reaching the floor of the Senate, Mr. Mansfield said, “I guess that's it.” The $2.67‐billion bill approved by the House compared with an Administration request for $3.5‐billion and a House‐approved measure that would authorize $3.4‐billion. Senator Allen J. Eliender of Louisiana, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, informed the House Democratic leadership that his committee would not consider the House appropriation until agreement was reached by the conferees on the deadlocked authorization bill.

702-> Berlin Compromise Reached, Then Lost
BERLIN, Dec. 8—A high‐levell East German negotiator, Peter Florin, made an attempt to complete the details of the Berlin agreement early today, only to back off at the last minute. Mr. Florin, a Deputy Foreign Minister, was appointed yesterday to finish up the disputed details of the Berlin agreement. He replaced State Secretary Gunter Kohrt, who was ill. Mr. Florin spent most of the night negotiating with the West Berlin spokesman, Ulrich Müller. They reached an apparent compromise at 4 A.M. on the critical issue of how to regulate visits of West Berlin's two million, people to East Berlin and East Germany. The compromise foresaw an arrangement whereby West Berliners could pick up visas for immediate entry to East Berlin every weekday and for several hours on Saturday and Sunday. Entry by automobile was to be barred except in cases of disabled people, families with small children and West Berliners traveling a considerable distance Into East Germany. Others were to be obliged to use public transport. At about noon, Mr. Florin undid the compromise. The sticking point, according to Western sources, was on the weekend permits. Mr. Florin was evidently told by higherups in the party to cut these to a bare minimum after he had conceded a more generous number. Under the compromise, the permits were apparently to be issued weekdays at five visa offices on West Berlin territory, manned by six East Germans each and on weekends, at two of these offices. The tentative agreement led to frenzied preparations in East Berlin, West Berlin and Bonn for hurried initialing ceremonies on both sides of the Berlin wall. The initialing had originaally been set for last Saturday and had to be postponed because of last‐minute disagreement over visits by West Berliners. According to Western spokesmen, when Mr. Florin backed off, he said that the initialin was still indefinitely postponed. Western sources concluded that Mr. Florin had been given new instructions by the East German leadership. The party leader, Erich Honecker, and his most trusted aides are in Warsaw today, attending a party congress. A Bonn delegation, led by Egon Bahr, who had already finished Bonn's end of the Berlin negotiations—details governing transit of civilian goods and persons across the 110 miles of East Germany between West Berlin and West Germany—held out hope until well after nightfall.

705-> Fanfani Nominated on Eve of Italy's Presidency Vote
ROME, Dec. 8—The Christian Democratic party, this country's strongest political force, nominated former Premier Amintore Fanfani tonight as its candidate for President of Italy. The designation of Mr. Fanfani, who is now Speaker of the Senate, came at the end of a Christian Democratic caucus at 10:30 P.M., just 12 hours before the 1,008‐member electoral college is scheduled to begin voting to choose Italy's next head of state. The balloting will almost certainly continue on Friday, and there were indications tonight that it might turn into a long‐drawn‐out contest. Earlier today the Socialist party, a partner of the Christian Democrats in Italy's Center‐Left Government, named its chairman, Deputy Premier Francesco de Martino, as its candidate for the presidency. He is a 64‐year‐old Neapolitan law professor. The Communist party and other left‐wing groups have committed themselves to backing Mr. de Martino, but they may switch votes if a stalemate between the Socialist leader and Mr. Fanfani develops during the early balloting. Last week the Social Democratic party, which participates in Premier Emilio Colombo's Cabinet, pledged to vote for re election of the incumbent President, Giuseppe Saragat, whose seven‐year term expires Dec. 28. The Italian Social Movement, the parliamentary arm of the neo ‐ Fascist movement, announced earlier this week that its 38 representatives in the electoral college would initially vote for the party's chairman, Augusto de Marsanich, but were available to support some other candidate later. Mr. de Marsanich, who is 80 years old, held cabinet posts under Mussolini. There were no other formal nominations, but political commentators speculated that some new candidates might emerge during the balloting. Among the names mentioned were those of three former Premiers— Aldo Moro, who is now Foreign Minister, Giovanni Leone and Mariano Rumor, all Christian Democrats. Other Christian Democrats who were said to have some chance to become Italy's sixth President included Giulio Andreotti, who was a minister in many Cabinets and is now his party's floor leader, in the Chamber of Deputies, Benign Zaccagnini, chairman of the party parliament, and Silvio Gava, Minister of Industry. Mr. Fanfani, a 63‐year‐old economist from Tuscany who has played an important role in Italian politics since World War II, is generally considered the front‐runner in the contest. However, his candidacy may be weakened by considerable infighting among Christian Democratic factions. Balloting is secret, but Christian Democrats have been known in previous presidential elections to have voted against official candidates of their party. In an acceptance statement late tonight, Mr. Fanfani made a bid for support by democratic, groups outside his own party. A tribute by Mr. Fanfani to the “ideals that inspired the resistance movement” against Fascism and Nazisni during World War II was interpreted as an implicit rejection of neoFascist backing in the forthcoming presidential election. The electoral college — the joint houses of Parliament and 58 delegates from Italy's 20 regions — will hold two ballots daily. Under the Constitution, a two‐thirds majority—672 votes —is required for victory in the first three ballots, and a plain majority—505 votes—on each later ballot. It is generally felt that no candidate can win on the first three ballots. Mr. Saragat was elected on the 21st ballot in 1964. The 423 Christian Democrats In the electoral college are the strongest bloc. The small South Tyrol People's party, representing the German‐speaking population of Alto Adige Province, and a few independents are expected to go along with the Christian Democrats. If all members of his patty Were to vote for Mr. Fanfani, he could count on 430 votes but would still need the support of at, least 75 other electors to become President. If he falls short in either of these categories, negotiations between the parties may lead to the designation of another Chris tian Democrat as a compromise candidate. Mr. de Martino is expected to receive about 410 left‐wing votes in the first few ballots. If his backing should diminish later, left‐wing groups may fall back on one of two other Socialists, former Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Pietro Nonni, who is 80 years old, or Sandro Pertini, Speaker of the Chamber of Deptities, who is 75.

706-> A Threat to the Peace
A major victim of the rapidly expanding war between India and Pakistan may yet be the United Nations and the principle of international cooperation for peace which it embodies. Although the threat posed by the Pakistani repression in East Bengal and the consequent flood of refugees into India has long been apparent, and has long since become manifest in direct combat between Indian and Pakistani forces, the world organization has made no move to intervene. It has been immobilized by refusal of the principally interested parties, including the major powers, to face up to their charter obligations to confront the issues forthrightly in the Security Council. The most disturbing delinquency is that of India, which on the one hand argues that the repression in East Pakistan “is a threat to our security,” as Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has declared, and on the other hand insists that the problems of Pakistan are strictly an internal Pakistani affair, not subject to United Nations intervention. The Indians can't have it both ways. If the events inside Pakistan since last March indeed pose a threat to India's own internal security, the Indians have an obligation to present their case—which is a persuasive one—to the world body before taking the perilous Military actions which they have already initiated along the Indian border with East Pakistan. Pakistan has gone through the motions of inviting U.N. intervention of sorts but on terms clearly prejudicial the interests of the repressed Bengalis and their Indian allies. The failure of the Pakistanis so far to risk a call for Security Council consideration of the issues is an indication of the weakness of their case and of the opportunities open to New Delhi if the Indians themselves would bring their grievances before that forum. A State Department spokesman said the other day that Washington was refraining from any call for Security Council action at this time in order to continue with “quiet diplomacy.” But Washington's quiet diplomacy over the last eight months has conspicuously failed induce Islamabad to move toward the political accommodation with elected Bengali leaders that is essential to defuse the current crisis. Especially after suspending further arms shipments to India, as was quite properly done yesterday, the United States could now afford to take a public stand at the United Nations in behalf of a peaceful solution to this political problem that is shattering the peace of the subcontinent and threatening the peace of the world. strong Security Council resolution, even if ultimately vetoed by Peking, might yet move President Yahya of Pakistan in a way that provocative Indian military action will not. Although the major powers have conflicting commitments on the subcontinent, they have an overriding common interest in avoiding a major conflict, as indeed do India and Pakistan themselves. The best remaining opportunity to achieve this common goal is to refer the problem promptly to the Security Council, which was created for just such crises and which cannot long survive as a credible institution if it remains in its present state of withering neglect.

707-> Ruling Bodies Shuffled
VIENNA, Jan. 3 (AP)—Pres ident Ludvik Svoboda of Czech oslovalda shuffled the federal and state governments today, in a move that was seen as re storing further central controls over the economy. These con trols were eased under Alex ander Dubcek, the Communist party leader who was ousted after the invasion. Parliament prepared for the changes on Dec. 20 when it revised Czechoslovakia's fed eralization law adopted under Mr. Dubcek. The revisions, which restored federal supre macy over the economy and other areas, were viewed as an effort to centralize planning and to reduce the rivalry be tween the Czech and Slovak states for the country's limited investment and material re sources. The official Czech press agency, CTK, said that Mr. Svo bade had appointed Jindrich Zahradrik, board of the industrial board, and Jan Gregory, the Slovak industrial minister, as new Deputy Pre mien of the federal Govern ment. As no federal Deputy Pre miers were reported to have been ousted, this meant their number was increased to nine. Four federal ministries were established. Stefan Sutka. Slovakia's transport, post and telecom munication minister, became federal Transport Minister; Josef Simon,, Czech industry minister, became federal Minis ter of Metallurgy and Engineer ing; Jaromir Matusek became federal Minister of Fuel and Power, and Drahomir Kolder became chairman of the Czech oslovak People's Control Com mittee. The changes in the Czech and Slovak state governments in volved a reduction in govern ment posts.

708-> Data Bank on the Arts Is Established
A National Research Cen ter of the Arts has been established by Louis Harris and Associates to collect and analyze data on the arts. The center will provide a computerized year‐round source of research and analy sis of the arts on all levels. Joseph Farell, formerly ex ecutive vice president of the Associated Councils of the Arts, has been named to head the center, which will operate as an independent subsidiary of the Harris firm. With headquarters at 1270 Avenue of the Americas, the center will use the more than 3,000 interviewers of Louis Harris and Associates to col lect data and opinions and will be guided by panels of experts from various arts fields and other disciplines. The center has been es tablished with the encouragement of government and private arts groups, which will pay to use the service. Louis Harris, president of the market research and poll ing organization that bears his name, said he had dis covered, when he served on the boards of various cultural organizations, that the supply of data on the arts was woe fully inadequate. The center intends to make a wide variety of studies, in cluding analyses of markets and audiences, finances, man power needs and the relation ship of the arts to other aspects of American life. The aims are to help man agements do their job more effectively, to provide poten tial benefactors with a clearer picture of the needs of the arts and to assist decision makers in government and the private sector in long range planning. “Our hope,” said Mr. Har ris, “is to set up a thoroughly professional research center which will serve as a kind of internal accounting system to help the arts assess more thoroughly the resources available to them and also allow them to target in on an optimum audience for their work.” The data bank to be com piled and kept current by the new center will comple ment rather than compete with the comprehensive study now being carried out by the Ford Foundation. The founda tion's first report is expected next March. “We have been in contact a number of times with the people at Ford,” said Mr. Far rell, “and believe their results will be very helpful to us, and we in turn hope to amplify the work they are accomplishing.”

710-> McNaughton Draft for McNamara On ‘Proposed Course of Action’
1. US aims: 70%—To avoid a humiliating US defeat (to our reputation as a guarantor). 20%—To keep SVN (and the adjacent) territory from Chinese hands. 10%—To permit the people of SVN to enjoy a better, freer way of life. ALSO—To emerge from crisis without unacceptable taint from methods used. NOT—To “help a friend,” although it would be hard to slay in if asked out. 2. The situation: The situation in general is bad and deteriorating. The VC have the initiative. Defeatism is gaining among the rural population, somewhat in the cities, and even among the soldiers—especially those with relatives in rural areas. The Hop Tac area around Saigon is making little progress; the Delta stays had; the country has been severed in the north. GVN control shrinking to the enclaves, some burdened with refugees, In Saigon we have a remission: Quat is giving hope on the civilian side, the Buddhists have calmed, and the split generals are in uneasy equilibrium. 3. The preliminary question: ('an the situation inside SVN he bottomed out (a) without extreme measures against the DRV and/or (b) without deployment of large numbers of US (and other) combat troops inside SVN? The answer is perhaps, but probably no. 4. Ways GVN might collapse: (a) VC successes reduce GVN control to enclaves, causing: (1) insurrection in the enclaved population, (2) massive defections of ARVN soldiers and even units, (3) aggravated dissension and impotence in Saigon, (4) defeatism and reorientation by key GVN officials, (5) entrance of left‐wing elements into the government, (6) emergence of a popular‐front regime, (7) request that US leave, (8) concessions to the VC, and (9) accommodations to the DRV. b) VC with DRV volunteers concentrate on I and TI Corps, (I) conquering principal GVN‐held enclaves there, (2) declaring Liberation Government (3) joining the I & II Corps areas to the DRV, and (4) pressing the course in (a) above for rest of SVN. c) While in a temporary funk, GVN might throw in sponge: (1) dealing under the table with VC, (2) asking the US to cease at least military aid, (3) bringing left‐wing elements into the government, (4) leading to a popular‐front regime, and (5) ending in accommodations to the VC and DRV. d) In a surge of anti‐Americanism, GVN could ask the US out and pursue course otherwise similar to (c) above. 5. The “trilemma”: US policy appears to be drifting. This is because, while there is consensus that efforts inside SVN (para 6) will probably fail to prevent collapse, all three of the possible remedial courses of action have so far been rejected: a. Will‐breaking strikes on the North (para 7) are balked (1) by flash‐point limits, (2) by doubts that the DRV will cave and (3) by doubts that the VC will obey a caving DRV. (Leaving strikes only a political and anti‐infiltration nuisance.) b. Large US troop deployments. (para 9) are blocked by “French‐defeat” and “Korea” syndromes, and Quat is queasy. (Troops could be net negatives, and be besieged.) c. Exit by negotiations (pare 9) tainted by the humiliation likely to follow. Effort inside South Vietnam: Progress inside SVN is our main aim. Great, imaginative efforts on the civilian political as well as military side must be made, bearing in mind that progress depends as much on GVN efforts and luck as on added US efforts. While only a few of such efforts can pay off quickly enough to affect the present ominous deterioration, some may, and we are dealing here in small critical margins. Furthermore, such investment is essential to provide a foundation for the longer run. a. Improve spirit and effectiveness. (fill out further, drawing from State memo to the President) (1) Achieve governmental stability. (2) Augment the psy‐war program. (3) Build a stronger pro‐government infrastructure. b. Improve physical security. (fill out) c. Reduce infiltration. (fill out) Strikes on the North (Program of Progressive Military Pressure) a. Purposes: (I) to reduce DRV/VC activities by affecting DRV will. (2) To improve the GVN/VC relative “balance of morale.” (3) To provide the US/GVN with bargaining counter. (4) To reduce DRV infiltration of men and materiel. (5) To show the world the lengths to which US will go for a friend. b. Program: Each week, 1 or 2 “mission days” with 100‐plane high‐damage US‐VNAF strikes each “day” against, important targets, plus 3 armed recce missions—all moving upward in weight of effort, value of target or proximity to Hanoi and China. ALTERNATIVE ONE: 12‐week DRVwide program shunning only “population” targets. ALTERNATIVE TWO: 12‐week program short of taking out Phuc Yen (Hanoi) airfield. c. Other actions: (1) Blockade of DRV ports by VNAF/ US‐dropped mines or by ships. (2) South Vietnamese ‐implemented 34A MAROPS. (3) Reconnaissance flights over Laos and the DRV. (4) Daily BARREL ROLL armed recce strikes in Laos (plus T‐28s), (5) Four‐a‐week BARREL ROLL chokepoint strikes in Laos. (6) US/VNAF air & naval strikes against VC ops and bases in SVN. (7) Westward deployment of US forces. (8) No de Soto patrols or naval bombardment of DRV at this time. d. Red “flash points.” There are events which we can expect to imply substantial risk of escalation. (1) Air strikes north of 17°. (This one already passed.) (2) First US/VNAF confrontation with DRV MIGs. (3) Strike on Phuc Yen MIG base near Hanoi. (4) First strikes on Tonkin industrial/ population targets. (5) First strikes on Chinese railroad near China. (6) First US/VNAF confrontation with Chicom M1Gs. (7) First hot pursuit of Chicom MIGs into China. (8) First flak‐suppression of Chicom or Soviet‐manned SAM. (9) Massive introduction of US ground troops into SVN. (10) US/ARVN occupation of DRV territory (e.g., Ile de Tigre). (11) First Chi/Sov‐US confrontation or sinking in blockade. e) Blue “flash points.” China/DRV surely are sensitive to events which might cause us to escalate. (1) All of the above “red” flash points. (2) VC ground attack on Danang (3) Sinking of a US naval vessel. (4) Open deployment of DRV troops into South Vietnam. (5) Deployment of Chinese troops into North Vietnam. (6) Deployment of FROGs or SAMs in North Vietnam. (7) DRV air attack on South Vietnam. (8) Announcement of Liberation Government in I/II Corps area. 1. Major risks: (1) Losses to DRV MIGs, and later possibly to SAMs. (2) Increased VC activities, and possibly Liberation Government. (3) Panic or other collapse of GVN from under us. (4) World‐wide revulsion against us (against strikes, blockades, etc.). (5) Sympathetic fires over Berlin, Cyprus, Kashmir, Jordan waters. (6) Escalation to conventional war with DRV, China (and USSR?) (7) Escalation to the use of nuclear weapons. g. Other Red moves: (1) More jets to NVN with DRV or Chicom pilots. (2) More AA (SAMs?) and radar gear (Soviet‐manned?) to NVN. (3) Increased air and ground forces in South China. (4) Other “defensive” DRV retaliation (e.g., shoot‐down of a U‐2) (5) PL land grabs in Laos. (6) PL declaration of new government in Laos. (7) Political drive for “neutralization” of Indo‐China. h. Escalation control. We can do three things to avoid escalation too‐much or too‐fast: (1) Stretch out. Retard the program (e.g., 1 not 2 fixed strikes a week). (2) Circuit breaker. Abandon at least temporarily the theory that our strikes are intended to break DRV will, and “plateau” them below the “Phut Yen Airfield” flash point on one or the other of these tenable theories: (a) That we strike as necessary to interdict infiltration. (b) That our level of strikes is generally responsive to the level of VC/ DRV activities in South Vietnam. (3) Shunt. Plateau the air strikes per para (2) and divert the energy into: (a) A mine—and/or ship‐blockade of DRV ports. (b) Massive deployment of US (and other?) troops into SVN (and Laos?): (1) To man the “enclaves”, releasing ARVN forces. (2) To take over Pleiku, Kontum, Darlac provinces. (3) To create a [word illegible] seaThailand infiltration wall. i. Important miscellany: (1) Program should appear to be relentless (i.e., possibility of employing “circuit‐breakers” should be secret). (2) Enemy should be kept aware of our limited objectives. (3) Allies should be kept on board. (4) USSR should be kept in passive role. (5) Information program should preserve US public support. Program of Large US Ground Effort in SVN and SEA a. Purposes: (1) To defeat the VC on the ground. (2) To improve GVN/VC relative “morale balance.” (3) To improve US/GVN bargaining position. (4) To show world lengths to which US will go to fulfill commitments. b. Program: (1) Continue strike‐North “crescendo” or “plateau” (para 7 above.) (2) Add any “combat support” personnel needed by MACV; and (3) Deploy remainder of the III Marine Expeditionary Force to Danang; and (4) Deploy one US (plus one Korean?) division to defeat VC in Pleiku‐Kontum‐Darlac area, and/or (5) Deploy one US (plus one Korean?) division to hold enclaves (Bien Hoa/Ton Son Nhut, Nha Trang, Qui Non, Pleiku); and/or (6) Deploy 3‐5 US divisions (with “international” elements) across Laos‐SVN infiltration routes and at key SVN population centers. c. Advantages: (1) Improve (at least initially) manpower ratio vs. the VC. (2) Boost GVN morale and depress DRV/VC morale. (3) Firm up US commitment in eyes of all Reds, allies and neutrals. (4) Deter (or even prevent) coups in the South. d. Risks: (1) Deployment will suck Chicom troops into DRV. (2) Deployment will suck counterbalancing DRV/Chinese troops into SVN. (3) Announcement of deployment will cause massive DRV/Chicom effort preemptively to occupy new SVN territory. (4) US losses will increase. (5) Friction with GVN (and Koreans?) over command will arise. (6) GVN will tend increasingly to “let the US do it.” (7) Anti‐US “colonialist” mood may increase in and outside SVN. (8) US forces may be surrounded and trapped. e. Important miscellany: (1) There are no obvious circuitbreakers. Once US troops are in, it will be difficult to withdraw them or to move them, say, to Thailand without admitting defeat. (2) It will take massive deployments (many divisions) to improve the GVN/ US:VC ratio to the optimum 10+:1. (3) In any event, our Project 22 planning with the Thais for defense of the Mekong towns must proceed apace. Exit by Negotiations a. Bargaining counters. (1) What DRV could give: (a) Stop training and sending personnel to SVN/Laos. (b) Stop sending arms and supplies into SVN/Laos. (c) Stop directing military actions in into SVN/Laos. (d) Order the VC/PL to stop their insurgencies. (e) Stop propaganda broadcasts to South Vietnam. (f) Remove VM forces and cadres from SVN and Laos. (g) See that VC/PL stop incidents in SVN and Laos. (h) See that VC/PL cease resistance. (i) See that VC/PL turn in weapons and bases. (j) See that VC/PL surrender for amnesty/expatriation. (2) What GVN/US could give: (a) Stop (or not increase) air strikes on DRV. (b) Remove (or not increase) US troops in SVN. (c) Rice supply to DRV. (d) Assurance that US/GVN have no designs on NVN. (e) Assurance that US/GVN will not demand public renunciation by the DRV of Communist goals. (f) Assurance that “peaceful coexistence” (e.g., continuation of Red propaganda in SVN) is acceptable. (g) Capitulation: Leftists in GVN, coalition government, and eventual incorporation of SVN into DRV. b. Possible outcomes. (1) Pacified non‐Communist South Vietnam. (2) “Laotian” solution, with areas of de facto VC dominion, a “government of national unity,” and a Liberation Front ostensibly weaned from DRV control. (3) Explicit partition of SVN, with each area under a separate government. (4) A “semi‐equilibrium”—a slow‐motion war—with slowly shifting GVN‐VC lines. (5) Loss of SVN to the DRV. c. Techniques to minimize impact of bad outcomes. If/when it is estimated that even the best US/GVN efforts mean failure (“flash” or defeat), it will be important to act to minimize the afterdamage to US effectiveness and image by steps such as these: (1) Publicize uniqueness of congenital impossibility of SVN case (e.g., Viet Minh held much of SVN in 1954, long sieve‐like borders, unfavorable terrain, no national tradition, few administrators, mess left by French, competing factions, Red LOC advantage, late US start, etc.). (2) Take opportunity offered by next coup or GVN anti‐US tantrum to “ship out” (coupled with advance threat to do so if they fail to “shape up”?). (3) Create diversionary “offensives” elsewhere in the world (e.g., to shore up Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, India, Australia; to launch an “anti‐poverty” program for underdeveloped areas). (4) Enter multi‐nation negotiations calculated to shift opinions and values. d. Risks. With the physical situation and the trends as they are the fear is overwhelming that an exit negotiated now would result in humiliation for the US. Evaluation: It is essential—however badly SEA may go over the next 1‐3 years—that US emerge as a “good doctor.” We must have kept promises, been tough, taken risks, gotten bloodied, and hurt the enemy very badly. We must avoid harmful appearances which will affect judgments by, and provide pretexts to, other nations regarding how the US will behave in future cases of particular interest to those nations—regarding US policy, power, resolve and competence to deal with their problems. In this connection, the relevant audiences are the Communists (who must feel strong pressures), the South Vietnamese (whose morale must be buoyed), our allies (who must trust us as “underwriters”) and the US public (which must support our risk‐taking with US lives and prestige). Urgency: If the strike‐North program (para 7) is not altered: we will reach the MIG/Phuc Yen flash point in approximately one month. If the program is altered only to stretch out the crescendo: up to 3 months may be had before that flash point, at the expense of a less persuasive squeeze. If the program, is altered to “plateau” or dampen the strikes: much of their negotiating value will be lost. (Furthermore, there is now a hint of flexibility on the Red side: the Soviets are struggling to find a Gordian knot‐cutter; the Chicoms may be wavering (Paris 5326).) Possible Course (1) Redouble efforts inside SVN (get better organized for it). (2) Prepare to deploy US combat troops in phases, starting with one Army division at Pleiku and a Marine MEF at Danang. (3) Stretch out strike‐North program, postponing Phuc Yen until June (exceed flash points only in specific retaliations). (4) Initiate talks along the following lines, bearing in mind that formal partition, or even a “Laos” partitipn, is out in SVN; we must break the VC back or work out an accommodation. PHASE ONE TALKS: (A) When: Now, before an avoidable flash point. (B) Who: US‐USSR, perhaps also US India. (Not with China or Liberation Front; not through UK or France or U Thant; keep alert to possibility that GVN officials are talking under the table.) (C) How: With GVN consent, private, quiet (refuse formal talks). (D) What: (1) Offer to stop strikes on DRV and withhold deployment of large US forces in trade for DRV stoppage of infiltration, communications to VC, and VC attacks, sabotage and terrorism, and for withdrawal of named units ‘in SVN. 2. Compliance would be policed unilaterally. If as is likely, complete compliance by the DRV is not forthcoming, we would carry out occasional strikes. (3) We make clear that we are not demanding cessation of Red propaganda nor a public renunciation by Hanoi of its doctrines. (4) Regarding “defensive” VC attacks. —i.e., VC defending VC‐held areas from encroaching ARVN forces—we take the public position that ARVN forces must be free to operate throughout SVN, especially in areas where amnesty is offered (but in fact, discretion will be exercised). (5) Terrorism and sabotage, however, must be dampened markedly throughout the country, and civilian administrators must be free to move and operate freely, certainly in so‐called contested areas (and perhaps even in VC base areas). PHASE TWO TALKS: (A) When: At, the end of Phase One. (B) Who: All interested nations. (C) How: Publicly in large conference. (D): What: (1) Offer to remove US combat forces from South Vietnam in exchange for repatriation (or regroupment?) of DRV infiltrators and for erection of international machinery to verify the end of infiltration and communication. (2) Offer to seek to determine the will of the people under international supervision, with an appropriate reflection of those who favor the VC. (3) Any recognition of the Liberation Front would have to be accornparded by disarming the VC dnd at least avowed VC independence from DRV ‘control. PHASE THREE TALKS: Avoid any talks regarding the future of all of Southeast Asia. Thailand's future should not he up for discussion; and we have the 1954 and 1962 Geneva Accords covering the rest of the area. c. Special Points: (1) Play on DRV's fear of China. (2) To show good will, suspend strikes on North for a few days if requested by Soviets during efforts to mediate. (3) Have a contingency plan prepared to evacuate US personnel in case a para9‐type situation arises. (4) If the DRV will not “play” the above game, we must be prepared (a) to risk passing some flash points, in the Strike‐North program, (b) to put more US troops into SVN, and/or (c) to reconsider our minimum acceptable outcome.

711-> Greek Celebrations Mark 150 Years of independence
ATHENS, Jan. 3 (Reuters)— Nationwide celebrations began today to mark the 150th an niversary of the Greek war of independence against the Turks. The celebrations, scheduled to last throughout the year, be gan with a service at the Athens Cathedral officiated by Archbishop Ieronymos, Primate of Greece. Officials of the mili tary Government attended the service and afterward laid a wreath on the Tomb of the Un known soldier. Military bands marched through the streets of Athens and the Greek flag was hoisted on the Acropolis, the scene of fierce fighting between Greeks and Turks.

712-> Architecture
HE butterfly‐like tent that appears to be floating over the upper part of the Museum of Modern Art garden this sum mer is not the setting for a garden party. It is banner and shelter for the Frei Otto show, an exhibition of tensile and pneumatic structures by a man who has turned a cre ative obsession with the tech niques of light‐weight, mini mal construction into high art. It will be there through September 27. The white tent is suspend ed from a 50‐foot high, V shaped main mast and two subsidiary masts anchored to the ground by steel suspen siqn cables that reach down, at one point, into the lower garden. The kite‐shaped can opy Is a prestressed, water proof membrane of vinyl coated Trevira polyester through which light comes softly. It covers an area ap proximately 64 by 36 by 21 feet, or about 2,300 square feet, and has been designed by a former Frei Otto asso ciate — Richard Larry Med lin, assistant professor and director of the Light Weight Construction Center of the School of Architecture, Wash ington University, St. Louis. Under the tent are pho tographic panels of a retro spective of Mr. Otto's experi mental studies and executed Works from 1955 to the pres ent, beginning with a small saddle‐shaped bandstand in Kassel and culminating with the huge cable‐supported, clear plastic roof for next year's Munich Olympics. Lud wig Glaeser, curator of the museum's Department of Ar Chitecture and Design, has directed the show. As art, the tent belongs legitimately in the museum garden. It is, indeed, a love ly thing. Its airy, sculptural grace is the direct, visible product of its precise en gineering principles. The ten sile structures based on these principles — tents, inflatables and thin‐skin shelters — are a significant 20th‐century ad vance in the building art, Frei Otto has carried that art to notable, limits. I, for one, stubbornly in sist that structural elegance is the real, 22‐carat archi tectural beauty; that it is gut architectural beauty, and nothing except the all‐too rare work of a master can touch it. When the structural solution is matched proper ly to the problem it makes superb sense, which is nice, and its visual splendor, fol lowing physical laws, is un surpassed by any sculptural invention. And so I like Mr. Otto's little tent in the museum gar den. I liked his much larger tent at Montreal's Expo 67, which served as the West German pavilion, even better, because it showed what he really can do. That superb marriage of art and science in the name of light‐weight, large‐span shelter was sabo taged by the overreaching complexity of the exhibit sys tem under it. But the mar velous, translucent, mem brane‐topped network of ca bles that made an intricate wonderland of soaring shapes and magic, filtered light is an experience impossible to for get. However, to like this work is not to agree with the mu seum's text. I am growing just a little irritated by the apostelic claims that must be put forth for every valid structural development. I am tired of the myth and fallacy of universal applicability, as it each were the structural second coming. I can sym pathize with the tendency of students to see domes, tents and inflatables as the world of the future, but the museum is sophisticated enough to know better. These are noteworthy structures, made possible by the unique technology of this century, developed by a man of genius, suitable for some striking and particular uses. They don't have to be uni versalized or justified with false pragmatism. For a va riety of genuinely pragmatic reasons we are not going to be living under them or cov ering our cities with them. Why can't we admire them on their own terms? The implication seems to he (and I've heard this song before) that they can do ev erything except cure the com mon cold. They are lauded as light, thin, tough, flexible, movable, expendable, eco nomical all‐purpose won ders. “The ease with which tensile structures can be col lapsed or moved or adapted for different purposes makes the current revival of the tent unusually relevant for an age of mobility and change,” the wall label says. “Membrane structures also hold the greatest promise for a future that will call for ever larger surfaces roofed on this and other planets.” Well, the age of mobility is here, and although most architects don't like it much, it is being served by the mass produced trailer, with all the comforts of home including TV in the wilderness, not by the complex poetry of tensile structures. Some things, such as sports stadia and cultur al centers, don't tend to move much, anyway. The rest is one of those solemn pieces of utopian ba loney that our culture seems to demand. To suggest that these structures are the an swer to the “age‐old ques tion of all construction — how to achieve more with less material and effort” — is woefully misleading. The “simplicity” of these lovely forms is complex beyond be lief. They are designed through a series of unbeliev ably elaborate models and testing procedures. This painstaking complexity and the inevitable high develop ment costs are made possible at present by a kind of hap py student slave labor at Mr. Otto's Institute of Light weight Structures at Stutt gart. Transferral of the proc ess to commercial economics would be problematic, to understate it. And you might just cast your eyes down from the airy membrane above you in the museum garden to look at the really formidable hard ware that controls it on the ground. Note how many marble paving blocks have been removed to sink that steel hardware into blocks of heavy concrete (you may, not notice because they are tinted gray to match the mar ble) to hold up that thin skin, and how many steel I beams, in addition, have been sunk into the planting beds. The necessity for this hard ware and its nature, the reali ties of anchoring, the extreme intricacy of calculation and elaborate test recording in the design process, often be yond the use of the computer, the prohibitive cost of the process under normal pro duction methods, all make these structures hardly the thing for your summer camp or experimental theater or climate‐controlled new town. The way ordinary construc tion costs are rising, any way, little extras like en vironmental climate control are farther off than ever. So what does that leave? Certainly not the universal shelter. We have some very handsome, highly specialized structures for very specialized functions. They span space dramatically, but for many purposes it is the hard way of doing it. They work well as “covers,” less well as interiors. They make superb exposition pavilions and fine permanent or retractable pro tection for arts and sports centers, The Kuwait Sports Center project with Kenzo Tanga Is breathtaking. Pneu matic skin structures are sug gested for storage and green houses. Tensile membranes can make good roofs for swimming pools, skating rinks, and open‐air shelters. I'm no sports fan, but I'd love to see that roof at the Munich Olympics. Tensile structures do their job with exceptional grace, style and structural panache. Frei Otto's work is a remark able synthesis of architec ture, engineering, invention and art. I am much happier because it exists, and happy to see it recorded and hon ored at the museum. The chief sponsor of the exhibition is the Graham Foundation for the Advance ment of the Fine Arts, and the show becomes a kind of farewell for its imaginative, enlightened director, John Entenza, who will retire this fall. His record of creative projects is one that few foundations can match, and he will be sorely missed.

713-> EARLY EDUCATION ON RISE IN NATION
An estimated 40 per cent of the country's 10.6 million children age 3 to 5 are enrolled in a formal educational program of some kind this fall, according to a study to be published by the United States Office of Education. The figure — an increase of almost 15 per cent in seven years and 2.5 per cent above last autumn — came despite a continued decline in the number of children in that preprimary school age bracket. “The enrollment figures suggest that American parents are coming to view early childhood education as a serious proposition,” said the United States Commissioner of Education, Dr. Sidney P. Marland Jr. The steady growth in such enrollments in recent years follows expanding efforts at early compensatory education for underprivileged youngsters as well as a number of research studies contending it is relatively easier to stimulate intellectual growth during the early childhood years. Both factors have encouraged the demand for nursery schools among families at all economic levels. Dr. Marland's office based this fall's estimate on a study of enrollment trends in preprimary school programs that are basically educational. Day care centers were excluded as mostly custodial. Dr. Marland estimated that 4,25 million, or 147,000 more children than last fall, were enrolled in such programs today. By comparison, in 1964, 25.5 per cent of the 12.5 million children age 3 to 5 were enrolled. Since then, with the exception of 1965, this age group's population has declined annually while the number enrolled grew. Dr. Marjand's study, which will be published later this fall by his office's National Center for Educational Statistics also found the enrollment rates varied with race, family income, education and place of residence. The study found, for example that 71.2 per cent of white 5‐year olds were enrolled in preprimary programs compared with 57.8 per cent of black 5‐year‐olds. Among children, age 3 and 4, however, there were slightly higher percentages of Negroes enrolled (14.4 and 30.9) than whites (12.6 and 27.1). Where family income was reported, the study says the percentage of youngsters enrolled increased as the income increased, rising from 24 per cent when family income was under $3,000 to more than 47 per cent when annual income was $10,000 or more. Regionally, enrollment was highest in Western states (44.1 per cent), followed by the Northeast (43 per cent), North Central (39 per cent), and Southern (28.3 per cent). The Office of Education provided the folowing table (numbers given in thousands):

714-> Union Wins Appeal on $1.7‐Million Fine
The United States Court of Appeals here yesterday re versed a decision imposing $1, 736,750 in fines against the Communications Workers of America, its Local 1101 and the local president, Howard Banker, as a result of a work stoppage last January. District Judge John M. Can nella had fined the union and the local for civil contempt, holding that they had violated a restraining order dated June 12, 1970, and issued in an earlier dispute involving the union and the New York Tele phone Company. The company had brought suit in January after members of the local stopped work to protest their being deprived of equal overtime arrangements with out‐of‐town workers brought to the city on a tem porary basis in an attempt to improve telephone service. Judge Cannella fined the C.W.A. $625,600, Local 1101, $1,012,500 and Mr.Banker, $99,250. The fines were among the largest imposed on a union and its officers in a civil con tempt casein recent years. The Union, represented by H. Howard Ostrin, had argued that the dispute that led to the strike in January was not arbitrable under the union's contract and arose under a separate agreement in connec tion with arrangements for util izing out‐of‐town workers. The union took the view that there was no valid reason for the contempt citation under the earlier restraining order since the court, it argued, may en join a union only if the dispute is arbitrable. The telephone company had argued that the contempt judgment was not appealable, but the Apeals Court disagreed. “We hold that these judg ments of civil contempt are appealable,” the court said. “We also hold that defendants were not in contempt of the restraining order of June 12, 1970, as extended by consent. Accordingly, we reverse.” The court interpreted the re straining order of June, 1970, as extended, as applying only to the June controversy involv ing the transfer of switchmen. “The orders and judgments of civil contempt therefore cannot stand,” the court said, “regardless of what our per sonal opinions may be of the wisdom of the unions' conduct and their arguably haughty dis regard of Judge Cannella's patient efforts to end the strike.” The members of the appeals court were Judges J. Edward Lumbard, Wilfred Feinberg and Walter R. Mansfield, Judge Mansfield said that he con curred with the majority ex cept that he would have sent the case back to the district court to resolve whether the June temporary restraining or der applied to the work stop page in January, 1971. Mr. Ostrin said that the court's ruling was one of the first major decisions interpret ing the Supreme Court decision in the Boys Market case which he explained, said that a Fed eral court could grant an in junction only in an arbitrable dispute in which the union strikes. “The decision vindicates the position of the international union that the Norris‐LaGuar dia Act, which prohibits the Federal court from granting an injunction in labor disputes, is still a viable statute, not withstanding the Boys Market case,” he said. A spokesman for the tele phone company said there was no immediate comment.

715-> TV Mailbag
To THE EDITOR: READ with considerable interest the article by Gordon Watkins—” ‘Hoo ray’ But Also ‘Shut Up’” —in The New York Time of July 25, To place Mr. Wat kins's comments in perspec tive, a few comments are in order. Mr. Watkins may indeed have set a few records as writer and producer of “Caught in the Middle” for WCBS‐TV, not the least of which are costly local pro duction and budget over spending—points that he did not mention. The 90‐minute drama was budgeted at $90, 000; actual cost came to $231,800—Which may be a record price for a locally produced television drama. Mr. Watkins wrote that “the Nielsen and ARB rat ings (which do not really re flect minority viewing pat terns) were far above the station's greatest expecta tions … ” The ratings were satisfactory, but no More than that. The Nielsen share of audience was 22 per cent for WCBS‐TV, 40 per cent for WNBC‐TV, and 18 per cent for WABC‐TV; the ARB share was even lower. (The Nielsen and ARB share for WCBS‐TV for “Caught in the Middle” were identical with the time period during the previous four weeks.) A spe cial survey run at the time showed that viewing in pre dominantly black areas in the New York metropolitan area was at the same level as total viewing. Mr. Watkins stated that “the executive who had pro vided the administrative im petus [for the production] had long since been ‘trans ferred.’ “ If Mr. Watkins is implying that there was an executive change resulting from “Caught in the Mid dle,” he is completely in error. Mr. Watkins complains that two of the CBS‐owned television stations outside of New York chose not to broadcast the production. However, two decided to carry it. This is not at all unusual and in no way re flects Mr. Watkins's conten tion that the stations feared that the broadcast “would stir up the natives,” On June 9, WCBS‐TV decided to rebroadcast “Caught in the Middle” in prime time on Aug. 10. Mr. Watkins says that he submitted other projects and “was advised that this was no time for more minority programs.” Actually, Mr. Watkins's maiden effort had been so costly as to require rethinking of all local dra matic productions. Mr. Wat kins notes that “finally I was assigned a half‐hour docu mentary and released before the actual filming began.” They program involved a choir in Newark. Plans were held in abeyance because of scheduling problems and the absence of live audience presentations by the choir. Mr. Watkins had originally been hired as a staff pro ducer although he had no previous television experi ence; he was released at a time when there were cut backs throughout the televi sion industry. Finally, Mr. Watkins con tends that his “experiences at CBS convinced me that the black and Latin popula tion will not see their herit age and lives presented with truth and taste until minor ity buyers and concerned citizens organize and force the established communica tions industry to give quali fied blacks and Puerto Ri cans the power to stimulate and originate programing.” WCBS‐TV is proud of its record in minority employ ment and in programing to meet the needs and inter ests of all minority groups. However, Mr. Watkins miss es the point and the value of such productions as “Caught in the Middle.” The importance of a mass com munication medium such as television is not in broad casting to or between minor ity groups; it is in communi cating to everyone about the minorities. The people of Harlem and Newark have no need for a production such as “Caught in the Middle” to tell them what ghetto life is all about; they have only to look out their windows. If any purpose was served by WCBS‐TV in presenting this drama, it was to inform the bulk of the people who never get to Harlem, to show them what ghetto life is really like. It is unfortunate that Mr. Miller is so ill‐informed, or something. Concerning over spending, the $90,000 figure he quotes had to be discard ed early in the rehearsal pe riod because three unions, who had not been included in the budget (because of ambiguities in existing con tracts), pressured themselves into the production. Second, I was not allowed to budget the total production; and the estimates for which I was responsible exceeded the orig nal figure by only approxi mately $300. The remainder of the budget was prepared and okayed by more “knowledgeable” employes, and many of my suggestions for money‐saving innovations were ignored because of my lack of experience. Concerning the ratings, I repeat: the ratings were far above the station's greatest expectations. Because the production was broadcast opposite the Bing Crosby Christmas special, a peren nial favorite, disaster ratings were predicted. “Caught in the Middle” did as well, or better, than the regular net work offerings for that time period; and the loss of view ers predicted when the Bing Crosby special began did not materialize. The “special sur vey” of which Mr. Miller speaks belies all my sub sequent contacts with the Harlem and Bedford‐Stuyve sant communities. However, if correct, the response by phone and letter, which I had previously described as unusual, must be considered phenomenal. Concerning an executive's transfer, please advise the executive in question that “Caught in the Middle” had no effect upon his status in the organization. Concerning the CBS owned‐and‐operated stations’ refusal to broadcast “Caught in the Middle,” the produc tion was offered at bargain rates to the other four sta tions in the group. The New York reviews were outstand ing and the Philadelphia sta tion was able to sell more commercial time than there was available in the pro gram. The Los Angeles and Chicago stations refused the program, and the subject matter and the work's force ful statement were given as the reasons. Concerning the list of pro jects submitted, Mr. Miller is incorrect in his assump tion that all the projects were dramatic. The list in cluded several documentar ies, and I had done consid erable research on a docu mentary tentatively titled “Busted Dreams,” which dealt with the frustrated am bitions of several blacks With varied educational back grounds. During this plan ning the “no‐more‐minority programing” edict came, the project was scrapped, and the less offensive choir sub ject was substituted. WCBS‐TV has made im portant strides toward re moving some of the horrend ous inequities which existed traditionally in their employ ment patterns. There are still, however, no Blacks or Puerto Ricans with the pow er to stimulate or originate programing. The amount of the sta tion's minority‐oriented pro graming does not reflect the large number of minority viewers in the metropolitan area, which it serves, nor does it reflect an honest con cern with the priorities and attitudes of its minority con stituents. Mr. Miller misses the point. I had not suggested that the white viewing audi ence be excluded or ignored. I firmly believe that the television industry can con tribute to the peaceful reso lution of mass tensions, and I said so. Presenting the black experience in America with truth and taste can help bring this about by educat ing the general public, It is just as important that the minority audience is finally able to watch the public air ways and see their lives and heroes presented with clarity and understanding. It is interesting that Mr. Miller presumes to tell me what the people of Harlem and Newark need and how they feel. But, then, that's what started all this in the first place. Isn't it?

716-> PHILADELPHIA UNION ORDERS STRIKE END
PHILADELPHIA, April 15 (AP)—Leaders of a striking transit union submitted to court pressure tonight and ordered their 5,200 members to end a four‐day walkout that had tied up public transportation for more than a million riders daily. The back‐to‐work order was announced by Dominick DiClerico, president of Transport Workers Union Local 234, following a three‐hour meeting with the 14 other members of the union executive board. The strike over a wage dispute with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority had been ordered halted by an injunction issued last night by Common Pleas Judge D. Donald Jamieson. He agreed with the authority and officials of the city police. fire and health departments that the strike had jeopardized the welfare of area residents.

717-> The World
WASHINGTON—As Europeans never tire of pointing out, the chief underlying cause of the recent international monetary turmoil was the long‐continued deficit in the United States balance of payments. Given the nature of the world monetary system, based essentially on the dollar, the American payments deficit forces upon other countries the often‐unpalatable choice of taking in more and more dollars, with some inflationary effect on their economies as their own money supplies are correspondingly increased, or revaluing their currencies upward, thus making them more expensive in terms of dollars, and consequently less in demand, to the loud complaint of industries and farmers that must now export at higher prices and are therefore less competitive in the world market. The “basic” payments deficit for the United States last year was about $3‐billion — not counting temporary flows of short‐term interest‐sensitive capital back and forth across the Atlantic, though these flows were important in the recent flareup. The United States consistently runs a surplus of exports over imports, though the surplus is much less now than in the mid1960's because of a big growth of imports. Omitting exports paid for by our foreign aid and surplus food programs, the small export surplus last year all but disappears. Still, the American trade position is not exactly weak. The payments deficit comes from other elements—military expenditures abroad, including Vietnam, tourism, dollars invested abroad by American corporations, purchase of foreign securities and the like, not offset by similar foreign expenditures here. While it unfair to single out any one item, it is obvious that a complete elimination of the balance‐ofpayments drain of the Vietnam war would all but eliminate the basic payments deficit. The best single means of improving the balance of payments is to have less inflation in this country than in the other leading industrial countries, which would gradually improve our export‐import position by making our exports cheaper and therefore more competitive. while imports would be more expensive and thus less attractive to the American buyer. Happily, prospects in this respect look good. The American price level is now rising less rapidly than that of nearly all our competitors. There is also encouragement in the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. And our massive corporate investments abroad are producing an increase every year in earnings, which return as dollar inflow. Finally, the recovery of the domestic economy should produce a rising flow of foreign investment here, particularly in the stock market. Thus the prospects are not all bleak. The Government plans no special measures for the balance of payments beyond the mild controls on some kinds of capital outflows already in place. In particular, there is no intention of driving up interest rates here just for balance of payments purposes.

718-> NETS BOW DESPITE BARRY'S 48 POINTS
DENVER, Dec. 14—Ralph Simpson sank a 14‐foot jump shot with 23 seconds remaining to give the Denver Rockets a 119‐118 victory over the New York Nets in an American Basketball Association game tonight. Rick Barry of the Nets scored 48 points, including the 10,000th of his six‐year pro career. The Nets' ace entered the game needing 8 points to reach 10,000, a plateau attained by only two other A.B.A. players, Zelnio Beaty of the Utah Stars and Ray Scott of the Virginia Squires. Simpson finished with 42 points. The Nets led by 13 points midway through the third quarter, but in the final period Dave Robisch went on a 12‐point spree that helped the Rockets to a 117‐111 lead with 1:34 to go. ?? ??

719-> Suns Set Back Knicks, 110‐100
Two ancient sayings, the one about lightning not striking twice in the same place and the one about nothing lasting forever, formed the theme of the 110‐100 victory the Phoenix Suns scored over the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden last night before a crowd of 19,256. The Suns, who have been members of the National Basketball Association only since the 1968–69 season, had never before won a game at Madison Square Garden. They had tried eight times and it was the most recent attempt, on Nov. 16, that made them wonder if they ever would. In that game, the Suns had a 19‐point lead with less than 10 minutes to play but were beaten, 112‐111, as Walt Frazier led a spectacular rally. This time, a similar situation seemed to be developing. Off to a fast start and ahead by 60‐49 at half‐time, the Suns took the same 11‐point margin into the final period and built a 17‐point lead with 10:22 to play, at 89‐72. And sure enough, Frazier, who had scored only 5 points in the first three quarters, suddenly found the range. He began firing away for what turned out to be a 19‐point period for him. However, traditional folk wisdom prevailed. Lightning did not strike twice, and the Phoenix losing experience did not last forever. The Knick counterattack did hammer the gap down to 98‐90 with 6:10 to go, still plenty of time for a successful comeback. But Neal Walk, one of several Phoenix heroes, scored twice from close range in the next half‐minute, and the Suns retained command. Frazier's final basket and his two free throws following a backcourt foul subsequently reduced the margin to 104‐98, but only 2:43 remained and Dick Van Arsdale helped stabilize matters with two free throws 15 seconds later. A tap‐in by Otto Moore wrapped it up with 1:32 to go, making the score 108‐98. The tap‐in was a fitting crusher, since the Suns won the game by sweeping the boards. They outrebounded the Knicks, 65‐39, and had an even more significant 21‐8 advantage off the offensive board. Along with their height, they ran faster and jumped higher than the Knicks did. The tap‐in was also Moore's only score of a game he started, but the balance of the Suns was shown in the rest of the distribution: Connie Hawkins, their star, had 21 points; Van Arsdale 21, Walk 24 (in 25 minutes of play) and Dennis Layton 23. ?? ?? Layton, the little rookie from Newark and the University of Southern California, impressed everyone with his quickness and accurate passing as well as his shooting. He hadn't played much against the Knicks before, but he was a fine quarterback this time. And while the others were scoring, Moore and Paul Silas took care of the rebounding, with 29 between them, while Walk added 10. The defeat brought the Knicks' record to 16‐13 and leftp them two games behind Boston in the Atlantic Division race. Phoenix, with the same mark, is a distant third in the murderous Midwest Division that contains Milwaukee and Chicago. And this was only the third time in 19 games that Phoenix had beaten the Knicks.

720-> 3 Men in Stolen Cadillac Slain On Street in High Bridge Area
Three men with false identification papers were shot to death early yesterday as they sat in a stolen Cadillac that was double‐parked on a Bronx street. Residents of buildings overlooking the scene of the shooting in front of a house at 1115 Walton Avenue, near McClellan Street, in the High Bridge section told the police that two men had spoken to the three inside the car briefly and then both opened fire with pistols. The police put the shooting at about 12:35 A.M. and said 11 shots had been fired at the three victims. One of the dead was identified through his fingerprints as Rogers McKinley, 32 years old, of no known address. The police said he had a police record here for stealing cars. All of the victims, according to the police, were black and were well‐dressed in sports clothes. One had $700 in a pocket. The two victims for whom the police had no identifications were described as in their 20's or early 30's. A fully loaded 45‐caliber automatic was found on the front floor of the car and a 38‐caliber revolver in the rear. The driver, according to the police, carried a forged driver's license, and the car's registration was made out to a nonexistent address in Harlem. The killers, who fled on foot east along McClellan Street, were described by witnesses as in their 30's. One was said to have a modified Afro hair style, to be about 5 feet 8 inches tall and to be wearing a leather coat. The other suspect was said also to be black, about 5 feet 6 incches tall and wearing a narrow‐brimmed hat. The 1969 black Cadillac sedan in which the killings took place was stolen three months ago in Maspeth, Queens, according to the police. Its serial number had been tampered with. The police declined to disclose the owner's name. The police said they had no clues to the reason for the killings. The police gave the following account of the shooting: As the car was doubleparked, with the victims in the front seat, the two gunmen approached it and took positions on either side of the front seat. After a brief conversation with the car's occupants, one of the victims got out of the car and said something to one of the gunmen and re‐entered the car, taking a seat in the rear. The two gunmen then leaned through the car windows from either side, both firing their weapons, and then made their escape on foot. The driver apparently tried to make a last‐minute attempt to escape by throwing the car into the drive gear and hitting the accelerator. But the car, with its brakes on, stalled. When the police arrived they found it with its engine racing and backfiring loudly.

722-> Stamps
BRITAIN'S 1971 Anni versary stamps, due Aug. 23, will pay hom age to an ancient city, a sport that was an ante cedent to American football, and a remembrance for its Armed Forces and the nurses who cared for the wounded. The ancient city is York, which is celebrating its 1900th anniversary. A Roman Centurion horse is depicted against the ancient Multangu lar Tower fortification at York on a 7½ pence stamp, which also depicts the city's coat of arms beneath a cam eo‐like portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, and the figure of denomination. The sport that preceded American football is rugby, and four “ruggers” of cen tury ago will be shown on a 9 pence stamp commemo rating the centenary of the Rugby Football Union. At lower right is a red rose, symbol of the English inter national team, above which is the denomination figure, surmounted by the Elizabeth cameo. The third stamp is a 3 pence. It commemorates the fiftieth anniversary of the British Legion, the organiza tion for men and women who have served in the British Armed Forces, or, in the case of women, those of them who were nurses. The depiction is of servicemen of the 1921 pe riod, and a nurse member of Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (now Queen Alexandra's Roy al Army Nursing Corps). Queen Alexandra was the wife of Ring, Edward VII. The design incorporates the Le gion's poppy emblem, sur mounted by the denomination and the Elizabeth cameo. The multicolored designs are by Fritz Wegner, whose provided designed for the 1969 Christmas stamps and three of the 1970 Anniver sary stamps. The stamps were printed byliarrison and Sons. The Women's Philatelic So ciety of New York has re cessed for the summer but before so doing elected Miss Bette Tusty president; Mrs. Sophie Buser vice president: Miss Patricia O'Grady cor responding and recording secretary and Mrs. Pauline Kotimsky treasurer. It also elected Dr. Eugenia Evart and Mrs. Doris fusty to the board of governors. Papua and New Guinea on Oct. 27 will release its Christ mas stamp “Native Dancers” from a design by Bette Hayes an erstwhile resident of the territory.

723-> Publishers Urge Making F.T.C. Consumers' Protection Agency
The Federal Trade Commis sion should become the nation al consumer protection agency, the American Newspaper Pub lishers Association said yester day, instead of having a new agency set up, as Congress has proposed. In a policy statement at its 85th annual convention at the Waldorf‐Astoria Hotel, the pub lisher group said the commis sion had long been “lethargic” and bogged down in triviali ties, but had been “revitalized” under Chairman Miles W. Kirk patrick. At the same time, John A. Scott, chairman of the A.N.P.A. government relation's com mittee, displayed a proposed symbol to be set into certain advertisements, particularly those involving many products at one time as in retail ad vertising. The octagon‐shaped emblem with a symbolic peering face urging “Read Label” has been submitted to the commission by the publisher group and the American Association of Adver tising Agencies. It would be an alternative to proposed warn ing notices in the advertise ments for each individual prod uct against misuse or side ef fects. Mr. Scott, who is also pub lisher of The Olympia (Wash.) Olympian, said newspapers should combat advertising that violates “decency, honesty, taste, fairness and accuracy,” and should seek to make ads “more informative.” Dr. Jon G. Udell, director of business research at the Uni versity of Wisconsin, forecast “the greatest absolute growth of newspapers in history” dur ing the nineteen‐seventies, un less a major catastrophe oc curs. Dr. Udell said 14 million more households would develop in the United States as children born after World War II ma tured and married. He held they would turn to newspapers for product and price informa tion. The 1,059‐newspaper associa tion, which operated on reve nues of $2,643,000 last year, revised its by‐laws yesterday to change leadership titles. Richard H. Blacklidge, pub lisher of The Kokomo (Ind.) Tribune, who had served a one‐year term as president, was elected to the new post of chairman. Davis Taylor, pub lisher of The Boston Globe, who had been vice president, was elected vice chairman. The board of directors then selected Stanford Smith, who has been general manager for 11 years to a new post com bining the titles of president and full‐time general manager. H. W. Armistead 3d of The Roanoke (Va.,) Times and World‐News, was re‐elected A.N.P.A. secretary. Jack R. Howard, Scripps‐Howard News papers, was elected treasurer. Two new directors were elected — Richard C. Steele of The and Gazette and Len H. Small Worcester (Mass.) Telegram of The Kankakee (Ill.) Journal —and six were re‐elected. The A.N.P.A. Research Insti tute elected as its president David K. Gottlieb, president of Lee Enterprises of Davenport, Iowa, publisher of 16 daily newspapers, succeeding Mr. Steele.

724-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: In his letter of Feb. 28, David Margolick says, “It is undoubtedly too early to comment on the voting record of freshman Senator James L. Buckley... ,” but he does so anyway. Mr. Margolick objects to my vote against curbing filibusters as inconsistent with my recent speech to the Young Republicans National Leadership Training School advocating “reshaping the politics of this country.” Although my views were set forth in the Congressional Record (Feb. 18) in detail, I should like to reiterate that the ultimate purpose of the two‐thirds rule is not to thwart majority rule but to keep the majority reasonable. It is a rule which requires the majority to take into consideration the depth as well as the size of minority sentiment; and it has bought time for sober second thought. Mr. Margolick states that I approve “what has become the last refuge of the die‐hard segregationists.” Mr. Margolick's example is self‐contradictory. If the existing rule is indeed the last resort of die‐hard segregationists, it has not enabled them to block the major civil rights legislation now on the books. Mr. Margolick conveniently ignores use of the filibuster by liberals. Indeed, the greatest Senate liberals of this century — George Norris and Robert LaFollette—wisely opposed attempts to limit debate in the senior house. The New Republic (Feb. 20), whose liberal credentials are unassailable, defends the two‐thirds rule. I urge critics of the rule to read the entire editorial, which said in part: “The filibuster could be destructive, if used indiscriminately by incontinent men, or if no majority, however large, were sufficient to overcome it. But all the institutions and devices of our government, not alone the filibuster, have it in them to destroy everything else in the process, once restraint and ultimate civility are gone. And the power of a majority that is large enough and, what is more important, that is confident of the validity of its purposes and correspondingly determined, is ensured by the present Senate rule, under which cloture can be imposed by a two‐thirds majority of members present and voting.” In short, while the two‐thirds rule does not guarantee well‐considered legislation, it can serve as a salutary restraint upon hasty and ill‐considered action, and it can moderate passions. JAMES L. BUCKLEY U. S. Senator from New York Washington, March 2, 1971

725-> Berenson, Blues’ Star, Is Traded to Wings
In the most fascinating trade in a week of big hockey deals one of the West Division's top stars, Red Berenson, was traded yesterday from St. Louis to Detroit. Going with Berenson, who had earned the nickname “The Red Barons” and is the only active player to score six goals in a game, was Tim Ecclestone. They were exchanged for the Red Wings’ Garry Unger, who had 42 goals last season but too much hair this campaign, and Wayne Connelly. Berenson, a red‐haired, hel met‐wearing, 31‐year‐old cen ter, immediately charged that he was traded because of his role as president of the Players Association. “Scotty is very much against the association,” said Berenson, referring to the Blues’ gen eral manager, Scotty Bowman. “I understand management throughout the league is very upset about some recent things the association has done—such as giving the contract for player endorsements to a private company instead of the National Hockey League's sub sidiary.” “I felt that Red's activities with the association were quite extensive,” Bowman said at a St. Louis news conference. “But he assured me it was only a figurehead job and not the rea son he was not having as good a season as last year.” Bowman insisted the trade was made for two reasons: “First, we wanted to build around youth. Second, we real ly wanted Unger.” Unger, a handsome, modish 23‐year‐old, couldn't quite re late to his new coach, Ned Harkness, this season following an outstanding campaign last year. Harkness sent him to the barber shop three times earlier this season to have Unger's hair cut to what Harkness con sidered a respectable length. Harkness, now the general manager following a front‐of fice shake‐up in which Doug Barkley became coach, said in Detroit, “I hated to part with Unger, but he was going down hill more than uphill.” Unger, off to a poor start, had only 13 goals. “I suppose it was my hair that got me traded,” said the center. Although youth was osten sibly a factor in the deal on the part of St. Louis, the club wound up with the same aver age age. In Ecclestone, it gave up a 23‐year‐old right wing. In Connelly, it acquired a 31 year‐old right wing, who scored 35 goads with the Minnesota North Stars in 1967‐68. Berenson, though, was the major player in the deal. When the New York Rangers traded him to the Blues in 1967 he went from obscurity to stardom. He was the first—and perhaps only—big name devel oped on the eight expansion teams that have come into the league since 1967. A graduate of the University of Michigan, he was an out sider with the Montreal Cana diens and then with the Rang ers. He became surly and sulked while a member of the Rangers and sitting on the bench. Within a few weeks of his trade to the Blues—in a deal that sent Ron Stewart to New York—Berenson moved into the superstar category. In 55 games with the Blues, he killed penalties, performed on the power play, saw regular duty —and wound up with 51 points, on 22 goals and 29 assists. His most extraordinary ac complishment came on Nov. 7, 1968, at Philadelphia. Berenson became the second player in the last 50 years to get six goals in a game. When the club returned to St. Louis, he was showered with a watch, a sta tion wagon, a boat and a gun. Berenson's totals for the 1968.69 season showed 35 goals and 47 assists for 82 points, fol lowed by a campaign in which he had 33 goals and 39 assists for 72 points. This season he has fallen to 16 goals, but was still the Blues’ leading scorer. Ecclestone was the team's sec ond‐top scorer with 15. “We got their two top scor ers, and they didn't get ours,” said Harkness, obviously elated with the deal. “I think Red's a tremendous person, and the fact he played at Michigan will help him here. This deal was too good to pass up—we turned down four previous offers for Unger.” Harkness denied that Unger's life‐style was a factor in the trade. “We can't sit status quo,” he explained. “It's the busi ness.” Last Monday. the Wings traded Bruce MacGregor and Larry Brown to the Rangers in exchange for Arnie Brown, Mike Robitaille and Toni Miller. The Wings thus got two new centers in a week—Miller, who played for Omaha of the Cen tral League, has been thrust into a starting role. Last Sunday night, the To ronto Maple Leafs, Philadelphia Flyers and Boston Bruins en gineered a three‐way deal in which Mike Walton went from the Leafs to the Flyers to the Bruins. The deal was made at the intercession of the league's president. Clarence Campbell. after an independent psychiat ric report stated that Walton was unhappy ,at Toronto.

727-> The World
MOSCOW—The question that is fascinating about the trial of the nine Soviet Jews now taking place in Leningrad is not so much whether they will be found guilty; under Soviet law, that is a foregone conclusion. They will all undoubtedly be convicted of participating in a bumbling plan to hijack a plane, sending abroad documents critical of Soviet policy toward Jews, and stealing a duplicating machine to aid in the dissemination of their protests — some of the charges brought against them. What is interesting about the trial is the question: why? Why did nine men, ranging in age from 30 to 49, all with higher education, good jobs, secure incomes, solid families, band together, albeit loosely, in defiance of the Soviet authorities, and risk their futures? Unique Character For the answer, evidence must be sought in the unique character of the defendants. All were profoundly Jewish in their inner psychology. In Soviet society, if they had forsaken their “Jewishness” — their desire to learn Hebrew and teach it to their children, to observe the Jewish holidays, and to have Jewish homes—they could have had comfortable lives as assimilated Jews. But by stressing their “Jewishness” and expressing a Zionist love for Israel, they inevitably came into collision with official Soviet policy, which actively encourages assimilation and which treats Zionism as a hostile ideology. Their frustrations led them to be reckless. Believing they would not receive permission to emigrate to Israel, they talked about fleeing the country, and apparently encouraged Mark Y. Dymshits, a desperate former professional pilot, to lead his group of 12 last June to Smolny airport near Leningrad, where they were arrested while walking to a plane they had hoped to hijack. Soviet security police, who apparently had been aware of the plot for some time, also swooped down on other Jews around the country who had had contact with the would‐be hijackers. The Leningrad nine were arrested for the most part on June 15, as were nine Jews now awaiting trial in Kishinev and four in Riga. What is poignant about the nine in Leningrad was that they were so untypical of people one would imagine in a conspiracy. They were, in a sense, similar to many Russian revolutionaries of the 19th century, more idealistic than practical. They publicly asserted their views in petitions sent abroad, mostly to U Thant, the United Nations Secretary General, and apparently talked freely about their plans. One defendant, Vladimir O. Mogilever, a 31‐year‐old senior engineer‐mathematician in a geological research institute, once sent a letter to the officials of the misnamed Jewish Autonomous Republic, located in the Soviet Far East, where Jews make up only a small percentage of the population. He asked if there was a Jewish school there. If there were, he would move there to bring up his family. He was told there was none. He then sent a letter to the Ministry of Culture and received an answer from the Leningrad City Council saying that “to open a Jewish school in Leningrad is inappropriate.” It has been clear that the Soviet authorities are convinced that the best way to handle the Jewish question here is to press for assimilation, by encouraging those who forsake “Jewishness.” The census taken last year indicated that the number of Jews in the Soviet Union dropped from 2.27 million to 2.15 million over the past 11 years, the only important ethnic group to show a decline. Ironically, in their ordeal, the Jews who were arrested have accomplished something for many other Soviet Jews who, like them, have sought to emigrate to Israel. Perhaps in response to the world‐wide outcry over the December trial in which two Jews were sentenced to death—later commuted to 15 years—the authorities in late February began easing the door open for Jews seeking to leave. Some Jews say the motivation for the more liberal policy was a desire to avoid trouble before the 24th party Congress which lasted from March 30 to April 9. In any event, about 1,000 Jews emigrated in March and 1,300 in April. In all of 1970 only 1,000. left; in 1969 the figure was 2,000. But even that policy, which was welcomed by many abroad, may be nearing an end. Moscow Jews said that a special commission set up to expedite the granting of exit visas to Jews held its last session on Monday —the day before the Leningrad nine went on trial—and the outlook now is not encouraging for those Jews who have not received permission to go. When the trial began last week, armed guards barred entry to all but specially‐invited guests. Only a few close relatives of the accused were permitted to enter. The other 100 places were reserved for the usual hostile claque. None of Moscow's foreign correspondents has been permitted to attend the trial and the only news—other than from Jewish sources — comes from Tass dispatches which are carefully edited to provide less in the way of information than justification for the state's case. But even the Tass dispatches are meant only for foreign subscribers; even less has appeared in the Soviet media. Ironically, the Soviet press has been bursting with stories about the arrest of Americans protesting against the Vietnam war and the latest developments in the case of Angela Davis. Thus the average man in Leningrad knows more about the trial of Miss Davis in far‐off California than he does about the trial in his own city. —BERNARD GWERTZMAN

729-> DRUG MAY COMBAT RARE NEW DISEASE
SEATTLE, Sept. 22 — A South African doctor, as the result of experiments he made on pigs, has suggested that an inexpensive drug might counteract the terrifying symptoms of a new disease that occurs, on rare occasions, when some patients undergo surgery. The disease, which reportedly was first described five years ago, is called malignant hyperpyrexia, or lethally high fever. The drug is procaine. The number of cases of malignant hyperpyrexia are unknown because no reporting mechanism exists. The 115 cases reported by 1969 were voluntarily published in medical journals by physicians in this country, Canada, Australia, England and South Africa. Since then, experts say the total has risen considerably. Although the condition is rare, doctors have expressed much interest in it because malignant hyperpyrexia strikes unpredictably and because lack of an effective therapy has led to a high mortality rate. The disease kills about 70 per cent of its victims. Pharmacogenetic Disease When it strikes, the disease usually affects young people under 20 years, but victims can be any age. Because it is sometimes inherited, doctors warn an affected person's relatives. Symptoms result only when a patient receives a drug that can trigger the illness. Otherwise, the patient is “healthy.” When a drug induces illness in people who have inherited a tendency to adverse reactions from a medicine's chemical in gredients, the condition is called a pharmacognetic disease. Pharmacogenetics is becoming a field of growing importance in medicine and surgery as scientists find that individuals show wide variations in their physiologic response to a drug. Doctors have reported that suxamethonium, a drug used to relax muscles, and halothane, a pain‐killing gas, can trigger the condition in susceptible patients. Anesthesiologists often combine these drugs when treating patients during surgery. Accordingly, physicians say they suspect that malignant hyperpyrexia is a pharmacogenetic disease. Malignant hyperpyrexta is not a cancer. Malignant means tending or threatening to produce death. Cancers are malig nant, but not all malignant diseases are cancers. When the few patients susceptible to malignant hyperpyrexia undergo general anesthesia for surgery, their temperatures rise rapidly to above 106 degrees Fahrenheit, and the metabolism, or chemistry, of their muscles is more active. As a result, their hearts beat faster and they breathe more vigorously and sweat profusely. The fever of malignant hyperpyrexia is generally much higher than those that commonly occur a day or so following operations. In such cases, surgeons are usually concerned about the possibility of infection and poor aeration in the lungs—not about malignant hyperpyrexia. Muscle rigidity is said to be a primary symptom of many cases of the disease. The rigidity can “merge into rigor mortis,” the British Medical Jour nal noted in a recent editorial. The journal added: “Indeed the mechanism of rigor mortis has been sought to explain malignant hyperpyrexia.” DOctors nave been mystified as to why the fevers become so high and why the muscles become so rigid. Abnormal Calcium Metabolism From tiny pieces of muscle obtained from a few survivors of the disease, researchers have found strong clues to the existence of an abnormality of calcium metabolism in the muscle. Calcium, a chemical that is normally present in humans, plays a key role in muscle physiology. Apparently as a resuit of the calcium metabolism abnormality the muscles lock in contraction. Knowing that a drug called procaine could block some of calcium's effects on muscle physiology, Dr. Gaisford G. Harrison of the University of Cape Town Medical School used large doses of the drug in experiments on Landrace pigs, which for unknown reasons, are susceptible to the disease. Procaine Is a pain‐killing drug that dentists often inject into gums to deaden the nerves while they work on the teeth. However, procaine's effect is not just as a pain‐killer. Dr. Harrison said he found that procaine caused the pigs rigid muscles to relax under experimental conditions. Then in a preliminary study, the doctors purposely gave malignant hyperpyrexia to five pigs. Two of the pigs survived. “No other method of treatment we have used has ever achieved this [result],” Dr. Harrison said in the report that appeared in the same issue of the British Medical Journal.

MIAMI (AP)—Frank Luther, 76 years old, decided a year ago to turn his collection of petrified wood into a model ranch house. It turned out to be a tedious job, but he calls the finished model “my pride and joy.” He used 372 pieces of petrified wood in its construction, as well as his skills as a retired carpenter.

731-> MARKET IS LOWER AS DOW SLIPS 3.65
Stock prices moved lower after a fairly firm opening yesterday as glamour issues led the retreat. Some Wall Street analysts spoke of “consolidation” and “profit‐taking” in the pattern of trading. An announcement virtually coinciding with the opening bell aided psychology in the morning. This was the joint statement that President Nixon and President Pompidou of France had agreed on the need for a prompt realignment of exchange rates through a devaluation of the dollar. As a result, gold‐mining stocks performed as the market's best group. The Dow‐Jones industrial average, ahead by less than a point in the initial hour, fell 3.65 points to 855.14. ?? (Volume 16,070,600 ashres) ?? Monday, Dec. 13, 1991 ?? Following its sharp run‐up immediately after Thanksgiving, the Dow has steadied slightly under the 860 level for the last seven sessions. The New York Stock Exchange finished with 566 advances and 828 declines. This marked only the second time in the last 14 trading days that losers outnumbered winners. Homestake Mining, the best percentage gainer on the Big Board, rose 1¾ to 21⅜. Other gold issues flashed these gains: Dome Mines, up 2%⅜ to 55¾; American‐South African Investment, up 1⅜ to 38, and Campbell Red Lake Mines, up ⅞ to 24½. However, gold issues are trading well below their 1971 highs. Earlier this year, Dome sold above 73, while Homestake traded above 31. Gold stocks took a tumble following the surprise move in mid‐August by Mr. Nixon on the tie facto devaluation of the dollar as part of his sweeping new economic program. In the light of yesterday's general market action, Charles H. Brunie, a partner of Oppenheimer & Co., commented: “I think the market is expecting the international monetary situation to be clarified and resolved in the fairly near term. The joint announcement is a major step in that direction. If no final resolution takes place, the market would interpret that as very discouraging.” Among the glamour issues, Bausch & Lomb gave up 5¾ points to close at 156¾ and Levitz Furniture dropped 3½, to 112⅝. Both stocks ended, near their lowest prices of the day. International Business Machines declined 4¼ to 320. Burroughs and Honeywell, each of which posted 1971 highs on Monday, dropped more than a point. Fairchild Camera lost 3¼ points to 25⅛. Its management said it did not expect the company to show a profit in 1971. Natomas, which rose 3⅛ points on Monday as the best gainer on the active list, fell 5⅜ points to 66⅜ as the biggest loser among the 15 most heavily traded issues yester day.

732-> Cahill Says U.S. Knew Of His Prison Record
Joe Cahill, the 51‐year‐old leader of the Provisional, or militant, wing of the Irish Re publican Army, testified at his deportation hearing yes terday that the United States Consulate in Belfast was aware of his prison record when it issued him a visa, in November, 1970. At a hearing at the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service at 20 West Broadway, Mr. Cahill said his conviction was a “political” action. Mr. Cahill's visa was can celed at the request of the State Department at least in part on the ground that he was convicted of the murder of a Belfast policeman in 1942, for which he served seven and a half years in prison. The hearing was recessed until 10:30 A.M. today, when the Government's attorney, Vincent Schiano, said a photo copy of Mr. Cahill's visa ap plication form would be of fered as evidence.

733-> GOVERNOR SEEKS WELFARE POWER
ALBANY, March 17—A bill to give the Governor, rather than the State Board of Social Welfare, the power to appoint the State Commissioner of So cial Services was introduced today in the Legislature. The legislation was seen as a reflection of Governor Rocke feller's recent criticism of the welfare system and as a step in keeping with his announced in tention to revise it. Although a spokesman for the Governor refused to com ment on the bill, which is be lieved certain of passage, the spokesman did recall that Mr. Rockefeller had already indi cated that he would present a number of proposals to the Legislature for revision of the welfare system. It was under stood that one of these revi sions would deal with the method of appointing the Commissioner. Mr. Rockefeller has been crit ical recently of George K. Wy man, the State Commissioner of Social Services. The criti cism prompted speculation that Mr. Wyman would not be re appointed upon expiration of his term on June 30, if the Leg islature granted the Governor the power of appointment by passing today's bill. As the proposed legislation would involve appointment with the advice and consent of the State Senate, proponents ar gued that the proposed appoint ment system would enable the executive and legislative branch es of state government to as sert greater control over the Department of Social Services. Mr. Rockefeller recently de clared that the philosophy and attitudes prevalent in the wel fare field were utterly unrealis tic under present circumstances. He referred to a remark by Mr. Wyman that those who did not earn $7,000 a year should go on welfare. Sponsors of the bill were Senator William T. Smith of Elmira and Assemblymen Law rence E. Corbett Jr. of Fort Edward and James L. Emery of Genesco. Senator Smith, chairman of the Social Services Committee, told an interviewer most Re publicans here believed that “a great deal of the failure of the welfare system is due to poor administration.” He said he be lieved that Mr. Wyman should not be reappointed and that “others in the top echelon” of the department should be removed. Assemblyman Corbett, chair man of the Social Services Committee, said that the de partment's “whole attitude was to give more benefits and as sistance rather than good ad ministration of programs.” “If we change the law, I would have some second thoughts about appointing George Wyman,” he remarked. When Mr. Emery, deputy leader in the Assembly, was asked if the measure was di rected at Mr. Wyman, he said the sponsors would not have put the bill in if they believed he was properly administering welfare. Mr. Wyman was attending a conference in Chicago and could not be reached immedi ately for comment. One of his deputies said he would not an swer “broad, sweeping charges” and would rather see “spe cifics.” With the Republican leader ship in the Senate and the As sembly—both of which are Re publican‐controlled — backing the measure, approval was be lieved certain. Earl W. Brydges, majority leader of the Senate, and Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea Jr. are supporting it. On the Democratic side, Joseph Zaretzki, Senate minori ty leader, said he was opposed to the bill, but he predicted it would get considerable support and be approved “overwhelm ingly” by his house. “People are unhappy with the whole welfare system, and I think myself it needs an over haul, but I don't think this pent‐up frustration should be taken out on Wyman,” he said. Senator Zaretzki added that during his many years in the Legislature he had found the Social Services Commissioners, including Mr. Wyman, “able, dedicated and qualified.” Senator Brydges said he be lieved “a position as sensitive as that of Commissioner of So cial Services should be subject to executive appointment, so that the Governor and the Legislature, with their responsi bility for all government opera tions, will have a more direct responsibility for the welfare system, instead of having the board act as a buffer.” When Assemblyman Duryea was asked about the bill, he said it was not “an effort to get Wyman” but rather one “to make social services more re sponsive.” One source who did not want to be named described Mr. Wyman as “soft‐hearted and soft‐headed,” and a legislator said: “If we could fire Wyman, maybe we could pass this bud get.” The Governor's proposed 1971‐72 budget of $8.45‐billion, with tax increases of $1.1‐ billion, has met considerable resistance here. Mr. Rockefeller told newsmen Monday he would trim the budget by at least $300‐million. He indicated the cutbacks would affect welfare and education aid to localities. The State Board of Social Welfare, which consists of 15 members appointed by the Gov ernor with the consent of the Senate, has had the power since 1940 to appoint the Social Serv ices Commissioner. It named Mr. Wyman in September, 1962. The law was revised in 1964 to stipulate that the appoint ment must be made with the consent of the Governor.

734-> Student Held in Slaying During U. of Puerto Rico Riot
SAN JUAN, P. R., March 17— A third‐year student at the Uni versity of Puerto Rico was ar rested today and charged with the slaying of the commander of the riot police last Thursday during rioting on the Rio Pied ras campus. Although 64 other persons have been arrested as a result of the riot, the student, Hum berto Pagan Hernandez, 20 years old, was the first to be arrested on the murder charge. He was charged with first de gree muder in the slaying of Maj. Juan B. Mercado, who was shot to death during the first moments of the riot. The police also obtained a warrant today for the arrest of Jorge Nogales, also a student, on charges of throwing Molo tov cocktails. He is still being sought. Major Mercado was shot with a 45‐caliber pistol that has not been found, the police said. Two other persons, another po lice officer and a student, were also killed by gunfire during the rioting. Mr. Hernandez was arrested in his home in the El Prado de velopment in Aguadilla. He was charged also with possession of weapons, and was ordered jailed by Judge Jesus Equeira when he was unable to raise the $30,000 bail. The rioting resulted from a clash between students who want to remove Reserve Offi cers Training Corps units from the campus, and those who fa vor the R.O.T.C. The students who oppose the training favor independence for Puerto Rico and they regard the R.O.T.C. as a symbol of the United States' presence here. In addition to the three per sons who were killed, more than 60 were injured during the rioting. The campus was shut down and has not yet been re opened to students, although faculty members were allowed to return yesterday. There has been no announcement of when classes will resume. A march and rally by pro‐in dependence students‐scheduled to take place on Tuesday in Ponce was canceled. No reason was given for the cancellation. The students had planned to march from Catholic Univer sity, one of the island's four private institutions of higher education, to a nearby slum. There they planned to hold a rally demanding that the com monwealth take over all the is land's universities and colleges and turn them over to the stu dents. The seven units of the Uni versity of Puerto Rico are oper ated by the commonwealth as public institutions.

736-> Disabled Stage Saigon Protest
SAIGON, South Vietnam, Sept. 7—The Vietnam Veterans Organization staged a small demonstration at the Ministry of Veterans Affairs today but failed to make many political points for its patron, Nguyen Cao Ky, when the Government granted most of its demands. Vice President Ky's support of the group appears to be part of his strategy of trying to stay in the political lime light, although he was first eliminated from the Oct. 3 presidential election and later refused to be a candidate. President Nguyen Van Thieu intends to run alone, but Mr. Ky has threatened to “destroy” him if he does. The leader of the small group of demonstrators, Nguyen Thai Ngoc, cut off the tip of his thumb and held it on a platter to protest the Government's ne glect of disabled veterans of the Civilian Irregular Defense Groups. The groups were recruited in the nineteen‐sixties by the United States special forces or Green Berets to defend border camps and to take part, in spe cial intelligence operations. Those men who were severely wounded were given medical treatment and severance pay by the Americans, who then had nothing more to do with them. Since they were civilians, the Vietnamese Government refused to pay them pensions or dis ability benefits and many with grievous injuries had to become beggars to survive. One of the demonstrators to day who shaved his head in protest was Pham Van Thai, a 32‐year‐old former corporal in the Civilian Irregular Defense Groups who lost both of his legs and was blinded when he stepped on a mine in Cambodia in early 1970. After being treated at an American hospital near Bienhoa, he was discharged in May of last year and given about $230 by the Special Forces as sever ance pay. “I am a beggar,” Mr. Thai said, staring sightlessly ahead. A tattoo of love verses on his arm is left him from the days when he was a whole man. William King, chief of the war veterans division of the American aid program here, said today: “Until recently, all a man like that got was the severance pay provided in his contract. But recently the Min istry made him eligible for cer tain benefits.” Last May, in fact, the Minis try decreed that veterans of the Civilian Irregular Defense Groups would be treated as for mer soldiers and paid disability benefits not related to their rank but based on the scale that applies to a private second class in the regular army. A double amputee such as Mr. Thai would receive about $15 a month. “But to find out who was eli gible we had to have records,” Mr. King said. “Those had all beeh sent by the Special Forces to the Federal Records Center in Suitland, Md. We sent a man there in June to get them. He just got back with almost 4,000 of those records for disabled men. The Ministry is now proc essing the claims that have been made.” The demonstrators, accord ing to the Vietnam Veterans Organization, want medical ex aminations to determine their degree of disability and disa bility allowances that corre spond to the ranks they had in the Civilian Irregular Defense Groups. They also want allow ances for the widows of those killed. Late this afternoon, a spokes man for the Ministry said that the first two requests would be granted. The question of allowances for widows was un der study, he said.

737-> Foreign Investments and Tourism Rise
PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti, Aug. 22—After stagnating throughout the Sixties, Haiti's economy is at last enjoying the beginnings of an economic boom, with tourism and foreign investment increasing rapidly under the four‐monthold government of President Jean‐Claude Duvalier. The economy was already slowly emerging from the doldrums during the last two years of the regime of President Francois “Papa Doc” Duvalier, but the arrival of a new Government in April has accentuated these trends. The new economic team of Finance Minister Edward Francisque and National Bank President Antoine Andre that is guiding the 20‐year‐old President seems aware of the urgent need for economic and social reform and, for the first time in years, there has been open talk of the need to institute family planning and a better tax system and to improve the lot of the peasants. According to foreign economic experts, perhaps the most important change of the last four months has come in the Government's efforts to reorganize the Haitian bureaucracy where in the past, tax revenues and foreign aid would often disappear without trace. Although the social situation of the country is still near catastrophic, with poverty, unemployment, disease and illiteracy affecting the vast majority of the population, these experts believe that the economy is no longer hopeless and the Government desires to catch up on the past. This new Haitian approach, combined with a relaxation of political repression, has enabled the United States and international organizations to consider resuming or increasing financial and technical assistance to this improverished black republic. A representative of the United States agency for International Development is now back in Haiti for the first time since 1963 and, although the full aid program has not been renewed, this is being considered. Although the Haitian econonmy grew by 4 per cent in, 1970 and it enjoyed its first balance‐of‐payment surplus in years, the boom is partially illusory since it has benefited only a small proportion of Haiti's 5 million inhabitants.

738-> Man in the News
Trygve Bratteli, a slight, ascetic man who survived the rigors of Nazi work camps and won a reputation as an intellectual despite a lack of formal education, took of fice yesterday as the Premier of Norway. The 61‐year‐old Mr. Brat teli, who spent the last five and a half years as chairman of the opposition Labor party, came to power on the heels of a scandal that toppled the non‐ Socialist Government of Premier Per Borten early this month. The principal issue facing the unassuming, introverted Mr. Bratteli is the same one that led ultimately to his predecessor's resigna tion: Norwegian membership in the European Econbmic Community. Mr. Borten resigned after admitting an indiscretion in disclosing a confidential re port on Norway's negotia tions with the Common Mar ket to the leader of the Peo ple's Resistance Movement, a group opposing Norway's entry. Mr. Bratteli (his full name is pronounced TRIG‐veh BRAH‐teh‐LEE) is expected to make Norwegian entry the prime mission of his adminis tration. In this pursuit, he can expect support from three of the four parties that composed Mr. Borten's coali tion—the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Christian People's. Mr. Bratteli will lack the support of Mr. Bor ten's Center party, which draws its strength from farm ers who fear their interest will suffer if Norway joins the trade bloc. Although a Socialist, Mr. Bratteli holds moderate views and is not expected to pro voke his opposition by ac tion toward nationalization of banks, insurance compa nies and industries. On Tuesday, a non‐Social ist newspaper reported that Mr. Bratteli's Government would recognize North Viet nam, and if the report proves accurate when the Premier speaks today before the Storting, or Parliament, Mr. Bratteli can expect support for recognition from some non‐Socialist quarters. Although his public per sonality is regarded as dull, Mr. Bratteli gives an impres sion of great dignity. Flashes of dry wit and moments of gaiety are reserved for an inner circle of associates. Hit dark, sparkling eyes are set beneath dark, heavy brows. His graying hair is receding. Trygve Martin Bratteli was born on Jan. 11, 1910, in a hamlet near Tönsberg, 50 miles west of Oslo. With no formal education, he made a career in the Labor Youth Or ganization from 1928 to 1933, advancing to the post of sec retary. Before World War II he was looked upon by members of his party as a cross between the Pope and Karl Marx—an ascetic and philosopher who shunned drink and sin. During the German occupa tion from 1940 to 1942 he worked in the timber indus try, then was held in camps until he was liberated in Germany in 1945. Mr, Bratteli was found near death in Germany in a heap of bodies with only his little finger moving. Before he became the fifth Labor Premier since 1928, Mr. Bratteli served in such posts as Minister of Finance, Min ister of Communications and vice chairman and chairman of the Labor party. Mr. Bratteli, who under went surgery for an ulcer last Easter, weighs 135 pounds. He eats cookies every hour to appease his stomach. Oc casionally he drinks red wine. He begins his day by pedal ing the equivalent of three miles on an exercise bicycle. Then he walks from his home to the Storting, which takes 20 minutes. In the evening, he is driven home by his wife of 25 years, the former Randi Larssen. They have three children, Tone, 24, a journal ist; Ola, 22, a mathematics researcher, and Marina, 18, a student. A rare glimpse of Mr. Brat eli's dry wit was given dur ing his days as Minister of Finance, when he increased taxes on alcohol. “If people want to drink,” he said; “let us add to their pleasure by increasing the expense of it.”

739-> Heath Bars Special Session
LONDON, Aug. 23—Prime Minister Heath today turned down a request by the Labor party for a recall of Parliament for a debate on Northern Ireland. The request, made formally by the opposition leader, Harold Wilson, a week ago, reflected Labor's growing discontent over the Government's Ulster policy. The main criticism of that policy is its concentration on military rather than political action. The rejection surprised some quarters because an opposition request for a debate on a criti cal issue is usually granted under ordinary parliamentary courtesies. However, Govern ment sources said that while the Ulster situation remained critical, the Prime Minister saw no purpose in recalling Parlia ment for what might turn out to be no more than a bitter exchange of charges. The House of Corrann which went into recess enrly this month is not due to reas semble until mid‐October

740-> Personal Finance
New attitudes about morals and the fight against sex discrimination have led to some interesting changes for young people to realize. There are also some eye openers for businessmen in dealing with women employes. Many insurance companies, for example, have been quietly amending hospital and medical coverage to keep up with today's moralities. More and more plans provide for payments covering abortions and similar medical treatment for the unmarried woman, including babies born out of wedlock. The Greater New York Blue Cross and Blue Shield also has liberalized its coverage to include the unmarried woman, providing she was at one time a member of a group‐type plan. The company says that premiums have not been raised as a result. As for use, since New York's liberalized law was enacted about a year ago, there have been about 20,000 abortions covered by Blue Cross‐Blue Shield out of 165,000 in the New York area. The money paid out amounts to less than 1 per cent of the $500‐million premium income. New York State employes do not now receive abortion benefits. Maternity‐benefit “house” rules may soon be under challenge. Many companies require that women give up jobs when they have babies, often insisting that they quit work several months before confinement. A recent court decision in Texas may upset such practices. In a Texas lawsuit, Schattman vs. Texas Employment Commission, the United District Court ruled that a pregnant woman's rights were violated under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when she was forced to leave her employment two months before the birth of her child. It awarded her damages of $1,103 plus interest, to cover back pay, sick leave, vacation pay and $500 in attorney's fees. The court noted: “Women are terminated not because of their unwillingness to continue work, their poor performance, or their need for personal medical safety, but because of a condition attendant to their sex.” If the employer—in this instance a state agency—had been able to show that her safety or efficient performance of the job was in doubt, then it might have had a stronger case. The court found no such impairments in this instance. “Indeed,” it said, “the defendant took almost as much time to replace Mrs. Schattman as would have been required by her doctor for the childbirth and delivery.” Under the liberalized mores of today would such a ruling apply also for unmarried mothers whom an employer might want to discharge because of the embarrassment involved? Another unsettled question: How much time for maternity leave can a company require a mother to take without being considered discriminatory? A recent decision by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has interesting ramifications for companies and their employes. It ruled that companies cannot apply “different standards to female employes and the wives of their male employes.” The case involved an employer's group insurance plan that provided maternity coverage for the wife of a male worker “immediately,” while female employes were not entitled to maternity benefits until they had completed two years of service. This ruling could cause consternation in personnel offices. In one area, the rules have not changed thus far. The Internal Revenue Service will not permit young couples living together as man and wife to file joint income tax returns, which often are a tax saver. Milton J. Wilpon, president of Taxtronics, a tax preparation service for business, wants reform in this area. He points out an anomaly —children of unwed parents can qualify as dependents and yet the parents themselves cannot file joint returns.

741-> 34 Die as Korean Prisoners ‘Invade’ Seoul
SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 23 —A group of 23 prisoners from a South Korean Air Force stock ade “invaded” Seoul today and caused several hours of fear and confusion as the Govern merit initially mistook them for North Korean commandos. The incident left at least 34 persons dead, 30 wounded and seven listed as missing. Sixteen of the escaped prisoners were among the dead, and the seven others were injured. Defense Minister Jung Nae Hiuk tonight described the 23 as “special criminals” who had escaped from air force custody on the small island of Silmi, 15 miles off the west coast port of Inchon. The incident led to an emer gency alert for all South Korea's military forces and temporary closing of Kimpo In ternational Airport, between Seoul and Inchon. South Koreans were shocked when the Defense Ministry an nounced in midafternoon that group of “armed North Korean bandits” had landed on a beach near Inchon, 20 miles west of Seoul, shortly after 1 P.M. and were attempting to invade the capital aboard a comman deered bus. Troops Rushed to Area Hundreds of soldiers and po licemen were sent to the Inchon Seoul road to intercept them. The escaped prisoners, dressed in paratrooper uniforms and armed with carbines and hand grenades, were surrounded by the security forces when their bus crashed into a tree in southwestern Seoul. Minutes later they set off hand‐grenades inside the bus. Fifteen were killed and four were severely wounded. At a news conference this evening, Defense Minister Jung corrected the earlier announce ment and described the invad ers as “special criminals” who had killed 12 air force guards and wounded another during their escape from the island. Mr. Jung said that the 23 were not military men but de clined to clarify what kind of criminals they were or why nonmilitary personnel had been kept in military custody. He said the mutiny had been staged be cause the men were “discon tented with their isolated in ternment on a remote island.”

742-> CABINET UNIT SET UP ON DRUG CONTROLS
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7 (AP) —The White House announced today the creation of a Cabinet committee on international nar cotics control. Secretary of State William P. Rogers, the chairman, termed it “the most major effort ever undertaken to control international drug traffic.” President Nixon signed a me morandum creating the com mittee last month. Mr. Rogers said the group had already met three times. Turkey has been the princi pal source of narcotics reach ing the United States, and Mr. Rogers said she had moved to control the opium trade and had been buying up this year's crop of poppies, from which it is produced. He also said there had been considerable progress in drug control in Thailand and that the Laotian lower house had enacted a measure to attack the drug traffic that is ex pected to become law. The other committee members are Attorney General John N. Mit chell; Secretary of Defense Mel vin R. Laird; Secretary of the Treasury John B. Connally; Richard Helms, the Director of Central Intelligence, and George Bush, the United States repre sentative at the United Nations.

743-> Nixon Is Said to Have Told Chiang In April of Shift in China Policy
WASHINGTON, Aug. 23—President Nixon was reported today to have advised President Chiang Kai‐shek late last April that the United States planned to support the seating of Pe king in the United Nations this fall. A message that the United, States was dropping its long standing opposition to mainland China's entry into the United Nations but would fight any effort to expel the Nationalists was reported to have been carried by a former Under Sec retary of State, Robert D. Murphy. Administration officials con firmed information on the Mur phy mission that was made available by diplomatic sources. The Administration officials said that Mr. Murphy had noti fied President Chiang in April of what has emerged more re cently as the Administration's official policy of dual Chinese representation in the United Nations. Mr. Murphy, who is chair man of the board of the Corn ing Glass Company, said in telephone interview today that he had visited Taipei, the capi tal of Taiwan, late in April in connection with his company's plans to build a plant on the island to produce television parts. He confirmed that he had been received by Generalissimo Chiang and Mrs. Chiang, whom he met first in Cairo in 1943 and again in Taipei in 1952, but he declined comment on any political conversations he might have had during this audience. ‘Consultation’ With Chiang Other sources said, however, that before leaving for Taiwan, Mr. Murphy had been asked to tell President Chiang, on Presi dent Nixon's behalf, that the Administration was changing its policy on Chinese represen tation. These sources described Mr. Murphy's discussion with Presi dent Chiang as a “consultation”, on a possible new United States, policy toward the question of Chinese representation. However, they said, the'Ad ministration appeared already to have decided on the dual representation policy when Mr. Murphy was requested to con vey his message. Under the circumstances, they said, the announcement by Secretary of State William P. Rogers earlier this month that the United States would support the seating of Peking along with retention of the seat for the Nationalists could have come as no surprise to the Gov ernment in Taiwan. This was in marked contrast with President Nixon's an nouncement on July 15 that he would visit Peking before May, 1972, and that Henry A. Kissin ger, his assistant for national security affairs, had just re turned from a secret mission to China. Little Advance Notice Given James C. H. Shen, the Na tionalist ambassador here, was informed of Mr. Nixon's an nouncement by Secretary Rog ers only 20 minutes before the President spoke to the nation on radio and television. Sources here noted that Mr. Murphy met with President Chiang about three weeks after Peking responded for the first time to the Nixon Administra tion's overtures for improved relations by issuing an invita tion April 7 to a United States table tennis team to visit China. This invitation is generally regarded as having been major turning point in Wash ington‐Peking relations. It ap peared to be a response to the State Department's announce ment on March 15 that the 20‐year ban on travel of Ameri cans to mainland China was being lifted. Reconstructing the spring's events, informed officials here said that the invitation to the American table tennis team had set in motion secret negotia tions that eventually led to Mr. Kissinger's visit to Peking. It was not known at the time, however, that the Administra tion had reached a point in pol icy formulation where it con sidered it advisable to inform General Chiang of its plans. At last year's General Assembly session, the American delega tion fought successfully to keep Peking out. Officials here declined today to say whether Washington had simultaneously sent word to Peking through secret channels that it was changing its policy on United Nations representa tion. Panel Urges Peking's Entry They noted, however, that on April 26, while Mr. Murphy was in Taiwan, a special Presiden tial commission issued a report urging the United States to seek as “early as practicable” the seating of Peking, but without the expulsion of Taiwan. The 50‐member commission was headed by Henry Cabot Lodge, former United States representative at the United Nations and now President Nix on's personal representative at the Vatican. For Mr. Murphy, who is 76 years old, the mission in Taiwan was the latest in a long series of special assignments, many of them highly confidential, that he has undertaken for four Presidents since his retire ment from the State Depart ment in 1959. His most recent previous mis sion for President Nixon was in Cairo, where he was a mem ber of the United States delega tion at the funeral last year of President Gamal Abdel Nasser.

744-> COURT ORDERS POLL ON UNIONS’ MERGER
WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 (AP)—A Federal appeals court called today for a membership referendum on a proposed merger of District 50, Allied and Technical Workers union and the United Steelworkers. A lower court had tempor arily barred the convention from putting the merger into effect. In an unsigned 3‐to‐0 ruling, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia authorized the union's executive board to draw up a plan to put the merger to a vote of its 180, 000 members. The plan is subject to ap proval by District Judge Bar rington D. Parker, who issued the merger ban last Wednes day, saying that the union leadership apparently meant to effect the merger without a membership vote.

745-> INTERNES, RESIDENTS WIN PAY RAISE HERE
The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation and an organization representing internes and residents at hosmendations made by an impasse.

The proposed salary schedule provides for increases over the two‐year period ranging from a total of $2,000 for internes to $4,300 for a sixth‐year resident. The scale for an interne will move up from the present minimum of $10,300 to $12,300 in the second year while the pay of a sixth‐year resident will be raised from $13,500 to $17,800. A chief resident will receive an additional $700.

746-> JACKSON PRODS U.S. TO GIVE ISRAEL JETS
WASHINGTON, July 14 — Senator Henry M. Jackson, Democrat of Washington, press ing Israel's repeated requests for more American Phantom fighter‐bombers, today accused Secretary of State William P. Rogers of helping “to make the Soviet Union a major Middle Eastern power.” Mr. Jackson, a frequent sup porter of Israel, said in a state ment that the total of Soviet military aircraft in the Middle East was nearly 600, with 300 planes stationed in Egypt alone. The United States, he charged,. has been “degrading” the Israeli defense capability and has allowed the military balance in the Middle East to deteriorate. The Administration has vigorously denied that re cent Soviet arms shipments to the Middle East have changed the balance of power there.

747-> Taiwan to Fight to Keep U.N. Seat, But Doesn't Expect to Win
TAIPEI, Taiwan, July 14 — The Chinese Nationalist Govern ment here appears almost re signed to losing its seat In the United Nations. It plans to fight to the end but is already con templating the aftermath of defeat. Although reports from the Western White House say Pres ident Nixon has not yet reached a decision on how the United States will approach the ques tion, responsible sources here seem convinced that the United States is committed to accepting the entry of Peking. They be lieve this can take place only at Taiwan's expense. Officially, representatives of the Chinese Nationalist Govern ment take the position that it has a fighting chance to retain its seat and keep the Peking Government out of the United Nations and some complex ma neuvers are under consideration toward this end. Privately, many people here believe that Peking will be given China's seat either this year or in 1972. They do not see any possibility of a compromise ac ceptable to Taiwan and its sup porters on the one hand and to Peking and its supporters on the other. While officials outwardly take a more optimistic view, they also assert that Taiwan's future is contingent upon more important matters than the question of United Nations membership. An official of the ruling Kuomintang party said: “The future of the Republic of China is not dependent on United Nations membership but wheth er we can provide a viable alternative for the people of mainland China. We will try to maintain our international position and continue to pursue the national objective of recov ering the mainland.” Statements calling for the recovery of the mainland are viewed by observers here as unifying slogans and affirma tions of principle more than declarations of realistic intent. “The U.N. is just another organization,” a Government spokesman said. He added that he did not mean to minimize membership in, the United Na tions but to emphasize that the Chinese Nationalist Govern ment had other international contacts. The spokesman said that it was playing an important role in more than 370 international organizations, ranging from Rotary Clubs to world bodies concerned with academic and technological questions. “People say We are Isolated, but we are not isolated,” he declared. A company executive who is also an influential member of the Kuomintang said the situa tion that has developed in the United Nations had not come as a surprise and the loss of membership “would not make much difference.” Various measures have been proposed here to obstruct the seating of Peking and the expul sion of the Chinese National ists. Supporters of the Chinese Nationalist Government may propose that a study commit tee tackle the question. Na tionalist officials argue that ad mission of Communist China as the “People's Republic of China” would require an amendment to the United Na tions Charter because the seat is in the name of the “Republic of China.” Some people on the fringes of the Nationalist administra tion are now even prepared to talk in terms of a “compro mise” that would see both the Chinese Nationalist and the Chinese Communist Govern ments seated in the world or ganization—but only if the Chinese Nationalists retained the Security Council seat. Realistic Chinese here con cede that any compromise of this nature would be unac ceptable to Peking and its sup porters.

749-> Excerpts From Text of Chou's Interview With Tokyo Editor
Frankly, we did not expect that the resolution would be approved by more than a two–thirds majority, much less an overwhelming majority, vote. This apparently was unexpected also for the United States Government and was also unexpected for the Chinese Government. As long as the resolution has been approved, we cannot go against the wishes of the peoples represented by many countries and of the peoples of the whole world, and we are deeply thankful for this support. This was a victory, not just for China, but for the great majority of the peoples of the world, including the Japanese and Americans. We are thankful for the support of the great majority of the Japanese people. When the majority of the nations and peoples of the world are welcoming us, we cannot very well refuse to go. However, we have not yet made adequate preparations. U.N. Secretary General U Thant sent three telegrams to Chi Pen‐fei, Acting Foreign Minister, and friends have sent us telegrams asking us to speedily send representatives to the United Nations. I have read‐the telegrams, but I have not yet discussed the matter with Communist party leaders. I have not yet asked for instructions from Chairman Mao Tse‐tung. In effect, we have no definite plan on what kind of mission to form. The end result was, how ever, that the “reverse important question resolution” was rejected by a difference of four votes, and the votes opposing the United States proposal totaled 59. At the time of the vote on the Albanian resolution, those in favor of the resolution numbered 76, an increase off 17 votes Pracfleetly all of these 17 votes were abstentions at the time of the voting on the “reverse important question resolution.” Some were originally in favor of the U.S:‐Japan resolution but later Changed to support for China. This was something unexpected; Japan apparently: likes “reverse” in everything. It was unexpected that these countries suddenly changed their stand And decided to support the Albanian resolution. This cart be said to indicate the trends among the world's peoples. Although 26 years have already elapsed since the United Nations was established, the Chiang Kai‐shek group, which was: overthrown by the Chinese people occupied the Chinese seat throughout. This is completely irrational and unendurable, and the phenomenon today is the result of “an explosion of the piled‐up emotions. That the Albanian resolution was approved by more than a two–thirds majority—76 votes for and 35 against—is irrefutable proof. The American computer was unable to function properly and went against the will of the United States and the wishes of Japan. That is why we must place emphasis on the results of the latest vote. This is because the results reflect the wishes of the 75 countries which voted for the resolution and of the 17 countries which abstained from voting, as well as their peoples, and because the results also reflect the wishes of the great Majority of the peoples of the world, including the Japanese and the Americans. In connection with our attitude toward the United Nations, there is an old Chinese saying which goes; “Be, careful when facing a problem.” We do not have too much knowledge about the United Nations and are not too conversant with the new situation which has arisen in the United Nations. We must be very cautious. This does not mean, however, that we do not have self‐confidence; it means that caution is required and that we must not be indiscreet and haphazard. Among the 75 countries which supported, the Albanian resolution, there are small, medium and large countries, while their locations, systems and environments are all different. However, all countries must be uniformly equal. We must particularly and without fail respect the opinions of the small and medium‐size nations. If the statements, of the small and medium‐size countries are ignored and if things are decided only on the basis of statements by the major powers, this violates the premise that small, medium and major nations are uniformly equal. In connection with those countries which abstained from the voting on the Albanian resolution, although they have difficulties because of the United States, we must place importance on our relations with them as long as they have hopes of moving closer to China. We must carry out analyses also of those 35 countries which voted against the Albanian resolution. For instance, the great majority of the Japanese people want friendship and restoration of relations with China, and they express gratitude for the fact that the Albanian resolution was approved and that China had its legal positions in the United Nations restored. Here, I would like to make the following statement to the Japanese people: “The joint wish of the Japanese and Chinese peoples has been realized, but we must further promote the developmerit of amicable relations and must go forward‐in the direction of restoration of diplomatic relations.” Among the 76 countries which voted for the Albanian resolution, of course, there are some countries which cannot have official governmental relations with China although their peoples are friendly with the Chinese people. One example is Israel. This does not mean that we cannot become friendly with the Jewish people. Israel started an aggressive war in the Middle East, and has not yet resolved this problem. As a result, Israel voted for China, but it cannot establish diplomatic relations with China. This is a major problem, but there must be no ambiguity In outlining one's position and drawing the Portugal voted, for us also. Portugal has colonies in Africa but China supports the national liberation movement of the peoples in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea. Because of this, Portugal may be thinking as follows: We have supported China, so China should not attack us on the colonial question in the U.N. Security Council. This, however, is something we cannot agree to. I have no such intentions whatsoever. Our principles are clearcut ones. We are opposed to the “major powers,” to power politics and to domination. We will not become a major power under any circumstances. You are probably well aware of our position.

750-> Chess: Fischer's Recent Showings Create Unbeatable Image
A chess tournament for computers will be held in Chicago over the first week end in August. It is reassur ing to know that some of our best technical minds are at Work in this area, and we May someday have a ma chine that can hold its own with Bobby Fischer. Clearly no human player appears capable of doing it. Whatever the final result of his match with Fischer, Grandmaster Bent Larsen of Denmark can content himself with the thought that he was the last one to beat Bobby— in a game at the interzonal tournament at Palma, Major ca, in 1970. The way things have been going of late, Larsen may be able to make the same boast in 20 years. After his interzonal defeat by Larsen, Fischer closed out the tournament with seven straight victories. He then went on to rout Grandmaster Mark Taimanov of the Soviet Union, 6‐0, in their quarter final eliminations for the world challenge against Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union. Fischer quickly gained a 4.0 lead over Larsen In their semifinal match, running his creak of victories over top opposition to 17. In the first match game, Larsen, with the Black pieces, Sprang a little surprise when lie played the French De fense, an opening he has not used much and for which he appears temperamentally un suited. If Fischer was sur prised by Larsen's choice, he was hardly unprepared, and soon got a winning game. The opening is interesting. Bobby has long favored the relatively quiet lines arising from 7 P‐QR4 or 7 N‐B3 over the wild play arising from 7 Q‐N4. Although devotees of the French Defense may be disappointed not to see the latter, sharper move, the variation actually played presents its own problems, mainly concerned with the placement of some pieces. Does the Black queen, for example, belong on QR4 or QB2? How soon should White play P‐QR4, if at all? Does White's queen‐bishop belong on its original diagonal, or on the diagonal QR4‐KN8? Should White play B‐K2 or B‐Q3 or maybe. P‐KN3 and B‐KR3? The second game was a catastrophe for Larsen. He had a big advantage all the way, but got into time pres sure, and doubtless over looked Fischer's brilliant 42 … R‐R5.

751-> Books of The Times
Her feet are frozen; her stomach growls with hunger; her eyes are half‐shut after sleepless night of air raids; her gums are bleeding from malnutrition; dysentery churns her bowels. This is how Hildegard Knef (Neff in films) begins her career on the German stage during the Second World War. In this first role, she says only two words, and the sirens usually interrupt the play before she comes on. Her first film —“for the war effort” — is called “Journey to Happiness.” She is no luckier with her first love. He is a film official, a protégé of Goebbels, a Nazi. When the Russians enter Germany, he is sent to the front lines, and because she has nowhere better to go, she disguises herself as a man and accompanies him. By this time, the German Army is so disorganized that no one notices. After door‐to‐door fighting, they are imprisoned by the Russians, she escapes and never sees him again. Bone‐Dry and Ironical With material like this, “The Gift Horse” might easily be bathetic, but Miss Knef writes with the strictest economy, as if she were still on emergency rations. She has been through so much that she can afford to treat her book as an anticlimax, keeping its tone bone‐dry and ironical. Her style is like a war wound that, instead of disfiguring her, miraculously makes her more beautiful. When she goes to the United States six years after the war, it is not kind to her and now she gives as good as she got. On Long Island, she sees “Houses in underwear, unadorned, half‐finished; houses, but not homes where one is born, lives and dies, houses to wait in, temporarily, by chance; outer offices, switch yards, clearance depots on the way to the waitingroom, New York.” Out west, “Needles, California, is a gold‐rush town without gold or rush, adventurers gone, fever subsided, houses like paper cups, use once and throw away.” Hollywood “looks like an impoverished relative of New York.” Miss Knef's first impression of Marlene Dietrich is splendidly ambivalent: dazzled by her act while seeing through it. They meet in a nightclub, where Dietrich obedience‐trains the entire staff with an indolent finger and gets away with lines like “I'd love to drink Badois now. Badois is the best thing in France.” At the hairdresser's, the author meets a sleepy‐looking girl with transparent plastic shower cap over her white‐blond hair and a thick layer of cream on her pale face. She is reading, or pretending to read Rilke, and after asking the newcomer from Germany where Rilke was born, she leaves with “So we'll see each other mornings, yeah?” After this description of Marilyn Monroe, who is “a child with short legs and a fat bottom,” Miss Knef generously adds: “The camera loved her. The camera registered the honesty, candor and naiveté which disarmed the audiences and made her a star after a few appearances in mostly bad films.” Frozen Out of Hollywood Because she has had a brief nude interlude in an otherwise respectable film, and because as an apolitical 19‐year‐old she has blindly fallen in love with a Nazi, Miss Knef is eventually frozen out of Hollywood, as Ingrid Bergman was at that same time. Back in Germany, she is treated as a “deserter” as well as “an indecent woman.” In a convulsion of postwar guilt, Germans are leading the world in prudery as they once led it in war. She is pilloried in the press, denounced from the pulpit, jeered at in the streets. Her mail is bulky with obscenities, and as the ultimate accolade, her underpants are stolen by fetishists. Back in America again as the lesser of two evils, Miss Knef is given the starring role in “Silk Stockings,” a musical version of “Ninochka,” by George S. Kaufman and Cole Porter. After a nightmarish month of rehearsals and rewriting, the star catches the measles, which she has already had. Two months later, after a billion dollars of bad publicity, “Silk Stockings” finally opens and is a smash hit. Miss Knef's book is many things: an unsentimental, gastrointestinal description of wartime Germany; a portrait of the movie star as a young actress; a gallery of George Grosz caricatures of the entertainment industry; a nosology of the disease known as fame; a painful bringing under control of life that seemed destined for suicide. Today Hildegarde Knef is happily married to the man who translated “The Gift Horse” into English—a sure sign of harmony—and she has a daughter, Christina. Her career on stage and screen—which began in a war that was never allowed to end for her — has reached an armistice at last. Some war veterans keep an empty shell casing or a disarmed grenade as a souvenir of their experiences: this book is Miss Knef's souvenir. But it is not empty or disarmed—it goes off in our faces.

753-> City Will Cut Authorized Police, Fire, and Sanitation Services Through Attrition
Mayor Lindsay announced yesterday that for the first time in a decade, the authorized strength of the city's uniformed police, fire and sanitation services would be cut. He said that through expected attrition — retirements, deaths and resignations —there would be 1,300 fewer policemen, 360 fewer firemen and 960 fewer garbage collectors and street cleaners by June 30, 1972. In a letter to the City Council and Board of Estimate—a letter that accompanied his revised $8.8‐billion expense budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1—the Mayor reported that altogether 14,320 city jobs would become vacant during the coming year and would remain unfilled. In addition, 5,013 jobs now vacant are to be abolished, he said, meaning an over‐all reduction of 19,333 city jobs. According to Budget Director Edward K. Hamilton, there are approximately 270,000 city jobs paid for by city taxes, so that the proposed reduction would be on the order of 1 in 14 jobs. No Civil Service Cuts Other departments that will experience major cutbacks in authorized strength, the Mayor said, are education, 4,580 positions, including 3,500 teachers; social services (welfare) 1,000; health and hospitals, 620. The cutbacks in personnel will not require the discharge of any Civil Service personnel, if the revised budget is adopted as submitted, the Mayor said. But he warned that it was touchy situation, dependent on full approval of his tax program by the City Council. “A hiring freeze of at least 90 per cent will be in effect throughout the city government,” Mr. Lindsay said, except in the Department of Education and in the expanding City University. For the uniformed forces, however, the freeze will be 100 per cent, the Mayor said, meaning that no vacancies will be filled. There will also be a “full freeze” on hiring police trainees. Council Chiefs Unhappy While the number of uniformed sanitationmen is expected to drop to 10.150 by July 1, 1972, the Mayor's budget provides for 40 new industrial engineers at $15,000 apiece, presumably to expand the Sanitation Department's “engineering capability and productivity.” This is one of the very few instances where the Mayor has requested new jobs in his budget, Budget Director Hamilton said yesterday. The inclusion of the industrial engineers began to cause rumbles of discontent in the City Council yesterday. The Council's leaders again insisted, as they did last week, on eliminating all new jobs “unless mandated to sustain vital services.” Another example of additional personnel, said Mr. Hamilton, is in the City University, which has a rapidly expanding enrollment mandated by the open‐enrollment policy. Even so, according to the Mayor, there will have to be an increase of more than 10 per cent in faculty “productivity” at the City University to cope with the larger student body. Move Called ‘Harsh’ The Mayor described the cutbacks through attrition as “harsh steps,” and considering the fact that the city is “too often troubled by group tensions, they are even dangerous steps,” he cautioned. “I must emphasize,” he said, “that it is impossible to guarantee that layoffs will not be necessary in the course of the year.” The Mayor called for an increase in productivity to make up for cuts in personnel. For example, in the Police Department, measures will include one‐man patrol cars. In the Fire Department, the techniques will include reducing the number of men and machines answering alarms in “low‐fire” areas. In the Sanitation Department new collection routes and procedures are being proposed. In a news conference, Mr. Hamilton said that the Mayor's revised budget had made no cuts in funds originally proposed May 1 for the court system, the office of probation and the offices of the District Attorneys. There were reductions, however, in the authorized, strength of the correction officer force —from 2,912 to 2,714. The Health Services Administration “will be cut back” across the board, the Mayor said. The revised budget, he added, will only support “threequarters” of the current slum medicine program. Other services to he reduced will be examinations to detect diabetes and glaucoma. Public libraries will “sharply” reduce their hours of operation, highway maintenance work will be cut by one‐quarter and park maintenance will fall drastically, according to the Mayor's letter. Parks Administrator August Heckscher predicted “dirtier parks, playgrounds and beaches,” He noted that the new reduction “comes hard on the heels” of a $9‐million cut and said his agency “obviously cannot do the job required.”

754-> Catholics Here Restrict Pastors to 12‐Year Terms
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York has announced a new policy of setting fixed terms of six years for pastors of local parishes and restricting pastors to two consecutive terms in the same parish. The new procedures, portions of which have been in operation on an informal basis for two years, also provide for “positive and constructive” review of a pastor's work every three years. The changes, which have been approved by the Vatican Congregation of the Clergy in Rome, are response to suggestions by priests of the Archdiocese. The ideas originated with the archdiocesan Personnel Board, a body of six priests set up to give clergy a greater voice in placement and related matters. The new policy was announced by Cardinal Cooke in a letter to the 1,200 priests of the archdiocese. In it he declared: “This policy will provide a reasonable system of rotation in the pastoral office. A tenure of 12 years in one parish will generally rebound to the good of bath the parish and of the pastor, offering fresh opportunities for challenge and renewal.” Archdiocesan officials said that the changes could be expected to lower the age at which young priests could become pastors of their own parishes because it would offer older pastors a “logical and honorable” point at which to retire or move on to other types of activities. The Rev. Patrick J. Carney, chairman of the Senate of Priests, hailed the changes as “forward looking” and added, “It is a good idea if you know that you are in a job for a limited period and can move on to another kind of work if you choose.” Cardinal Cooke said that the policy would not be binding on pastors who were assigned prior to Jan. 1, 1969. Appointments since then have been made with the informal agreement that they would be for a fixed term, but the other changes are new.

755-> OUTLOOK ON STEEL STIRS OPTIMISM
PITTSBURGH, Aug. 22—The steel market outlook brightened last week. Although orders continued to lag, the economic program of President Nixon brought forecasts of a strong steel recovery. Steel shipments, which have been running at an annual rate of 48 million tons, were seen rising to 96 million tons in 1972. A leading analyst said shipments could rise from 4 million tons in August to 7 million tons in December. These pronouncements came in the face of order rates that were averaging something like 40 per cent of capacity. Mill officials said there was no order improvement last week and that no real shipping gain was indicated for September. Producers Elated Nevertheless, steel men were elated by the benefits they saw flowing from most phases of new economic program. The 10 per cent investment credit was seen increasing capital spending, which affects about 50 per cent of all steel produced. New tax and trade measures were expected to lift the auto industry, which consumes 15 to 20 per cent of steel. “This more or less guarantees an improvement in 1972,” said a mill analyst. Iron Age magazine said the capital surge could reach basic steel at an early date. The steel for industrial projects is placed well in advance of actual construction, Iron Age said. Money spent in 1972 could generate steel requirements in late 1971, the magazine noted. A sales official agreed that capital activity could have a “snowballing” effect. He warned, however, that steel users are in the process of working off 11 million tons of excess inventory. Varying Opinions As these comments sugested, opinions varied on the timing of the steel recovery. There was general agreement, however, that a decisive change for the better was in the making. In some cases, steel officials were sticking with earlier forecasts but viewing these with greater confidence. “Until last week, I had some misgivings,” said a marketing man. “I'm not as nervous as was about 1972.” A mill analyst said smewhat the same thing. “The new program turns what might have been a really sluggish situation into an acceptable situation.” Mill officials were not sure how currency and tariff changes would affect steel imports. Regarding the immediate outlook, officials pointed out that many importers will have filled their 1971 quotas by the end of September.

756-> Zoo Cat's Death Starts Lead‐Poison Study
Lead from paint and possibly from the atmosphereapparently has caused serious illness in two leopards at the Staten Island Zoo, and animals in captivity elsewhere could be similarly affected, a team of veterinarians and physicians said yesterday. The doctors were joined at a news conference in the New York Medical College by Dennis Crastori, a toxicologist from the Medical Examiner's office, who said that four brands of “leadfree paint” had been found to have higher levels of the metal than permitted by the city's Health Code. The two sets of findings, the doctors said, raise new questions about the hazards to humans of lead from the environment. Lead poisoning has been known to affect children who eat chips of paint containing the metal, which can produce anemia, brain damage, convulsions and other problems. The question of whether atmospheric contamination can cause lead poisoning has been raised before, but scientists have had difficulty documenting evidence to support that theory. The researchers said that the animals living in outside 200 areas had higher lead levels than those living inside, suggesting that lead fallout from the atmosphere might explain the difference. The animal lead poisoning was discovered recently “quite by accident” at the Staten Island Zoo after a leopard suddenly became paralyzed and died, according to Dr. Ralph F. Strebel, a pathologist at the New York Medical College. Autopsy Performed He and other doctors at the medical school are cooperating with the New York and Staten Island Zoological. Societies to learn more about the diseases that man shares with other animals. Originally mystified by the leopard's death, the doctors examined its vital organs in an autopsy and found abnormally high levels of lead and zinc. Then, a few weeks later, the leopard's twin known as “Mr. Leo Pard” also became paralyzed at the zoo. Tests showed that it, too, had high levels of lead. The leopard recovered after intensive treatment in the animal quarters of the medical school. When it was returned to the zoo, the values of its lead tests rose and the animal lost three teeth. About three weeks ago, Mr. Pard had a convulsion. The animal was rushed back to the medical college at Fifth Avenue and 106th Street, where the cat is now recuperating. As a result of finding abnormally high levels of lead in the leopards and also in some snakes that had lost their ability to slither normally, Dr. Strabel said, the doctors began broader studies of other animals in the Staten Island Zoo and of some housed elsewhere in the city. Surprisingly, Dr. Strabel said, they found abnormablly high levels in the hair and the stool of monkeys and other primates, and of the entire cat family. The researchers also are testing a great horned owl to learn whether lead poisoning might explain why the bird has been moulting abnormally. Also to their surprise, the investigators found high levels of lead in the paint, bricks, mortar, and the dust accumulating around exhaust vents and in dead rodents that had scurried about the inside of the zoo. Cages Are Repainted Outside, the doctors said they found similarly high levels of lead in soil and leaves. Normal lead levels, they said, were found in the food and water that the animals ate. To prevent further cases of lead poisoning, workers have repainted animal cages and quarters at the zoo, its general curator, William Summerville, said. Eventually, he added, “We hope to have the cages tiled to end the problem.” The doctors said they did not know how the dust, soil and leaves had become contaminated. However, the doctors said they suspected that automobile exhaust from leaded gasoline had played a significant role. A hitherto unappreciated hazard may exist for children as a result of the tests that Mr. Craston made on 16 brands of supposedly leadfree paint. Mr. Craston said that 12 of the brands met the standards of the New York City Health Code, which prohibits the use of paint containing more than 1 per cent lead for “interior” use within dwellings. Lead paint is permissible for use on roofs and outside walls of houses, but the label must say that the paint contains lead. Yet four of the 16 brands labelled “interior,” Mr. Creston said, had between 1 and 3 per cent lead content. The labels on those cans did not warn of lead content, he said. The New York City Health Department tested about 50 brands of paints in 1967 and 1968, Dr. Vincent Guinee, a City Health Department physician, said in a separate interview, and found that all had lead levels within the criteria in the health code.

757-> Mr. Nixon on Housing
President Nixon's statement of policy concerning racial discrimination in housing recognizes that there is a decisive difference between desegregation and integration. Desegregation forbids any racial barrier to the purchase or rental of property and precludes a community's use of the zoning power to keep out federally assisted housing which would be racially integrated. The President pledges himself to the vigorous enforcement of the laws against racial discrimination. The Justice Department's suit filed yesterday against the St. Louis suburb of Blackjack on the zoning issue is an effort by the Administration to show good faith on that pledge. Integration, however, is much more than the mere absence of overt discrimination. It entails active use of the Government's financial power to plan and carry through the dispersal of population in accordance with certain criteria. The criterion can be economic and require that if a community is to qualify for any Federal financial assistance, it must have a mix of lowmiddle and high‐income people. Or the criterion can be racial and require that a white community accept a certain number of blacks and other racial minorities. Whichever criterion is used, the Federal Government would have to apply unremitting financial pressure on recalcitrant communities to enforce acceptance of planned integration. Whether such a Federal program would work under the best of circumstances is open to serious question. In any event, President Nixon undoubtedly reflects the preponderant weight of public opinion in refusing to use various kinds of Federal financial assistance as a lever to brig about integration. As a practical matter, if, there is to be any largescale dispersal of low‐income blacks from the inner cities, it can only be to new towns. If such towns were built with attractive housing, industry to provide local jobs, and adequate transit and community facilities, whites as well as blacks would be attracted to them. It would then be possible for integrated social patterns to emerge naturally. The sore issue of disrupting existing community patterns would not arise. The Housing Act of 1970 made generous provision for starting federally assisted new towns. It is dismaying that the Administration has requested only token sums to carry out this program and has adopted a chilly attitude toward it.

758-> Marcuse as Torquemada of the Left
WILMETTE, Ill,—Reading Marcuse since 1955 has been, of course, a protracted struggle against his prose. Until the publication of “Repressive Tolerance” I did not clearly perceive that he is a Torquemada of the left; nor did I see when I began to read him how defective his thought is. I'll mention some of its most glaring defects: The aprioristic disregard of empirical data; the frozen certainty about open questions; in some crucial respects, its shallowness and its incoherence. Only in two respects is Marcuse utterly lucid: in his desire to destroy our world, and in his yearning to be relieved of the tyranny of the genital in order to live in a nebulous, polymorphically anarchic dystopia. These defects can be fully documented, but here are a few random samples. Take his rage at the alleged fact that Americans crave big cars. Would Detroit be worried about imports if we all did? Take his appeal to “Reason” which, as a critic has noted, enables him to assert anything he wants. Take his indifference to rigorous sociological methods. More importantly, take his argument against Freud, that culture condemns us necessarily to radical frustration. He asserts that “instincts” are culturally determined and not exclusively biological in nature. So they are. But it does not follow that their genetically transmitted structures can be culturally controlled—not as yet, at least. Failure to face this question invalidates Marcuse's revision of Freud. Why doesn't he see this obvious error? Because he is not concerned with the truth but with propaganda. Not one of his critics, to my knowledge, has dwelt on the coarseness of his thought. But note that a man can be intelligent and learned and think with a sledgehammer, or can be illiterate but endowed with a fine mind and think with a scalpel. Marcuse's coarseness is revealed in his failure to note substantive distinctions. I'll give two examples. He calls our democracy “totalitarian,” thus lumping it with the Communist dictatorships, He writes that “those whose life is the hell of the Affluent Society are kept in line by a brutality that revives late medieval and early modern practices.” He is not writing about Haiti or Nicaragua but about America, whose people are desperately trying to redress ancient iniquities, and in which Black Panthers, Kingman Brewster's Marcusean opinion to the contrary, get a fair trial. Take his assumption that everybody suffers from the tyranny of the genital, which in his dystopia we would be freed from. There is no hard data, but I suggest that people probably range from a few satyrs and nymphomaniacs through numbers of persons suffering from varying degrees of sexual nagging, to a few undersexed but otherwise “normal” and a few neurotically frigid. Marcuse is ready to wreck our society to free its members from a condition they may not suffer from. Or take the over‐all absurdity of his charges. He not only sputters angrily because American workers do not want to destroy the system that gives them a good life, but also because Americans love gadgets, can't do without television, play their transistor radios loudly at the beach, love splitlevel homes, use acronyms, and express their aggressiveness by pulling their monstrous cars up to the pump and ordering, “Put a tiger in my tank.” Trivialities are mixed with half‐truths, with exaggerations and with total inventions, in a rancorous arroyo of slanderous abuse of our world, be cause it does not live up to his ideal of a “rational” society. Mixed with the slanders are some wacky theories such as his notions of the function of philosophy and of art. “The intellectual dissolution and even subversion of the given facts [the status quo] is the historical task of philosophy.” And “Prior to the period of cultural reconciliation” (prior to our period) art revealed “a dimension of man and nature which was repressed and repelled in reality.” These generalizations disregard the heterogeneity of Western philosophy and art, the many contradictory functions they have actually served, not to mention the difficult theoretical problem of how to select from the plurality of actual functions performed the one which defines the essential of each. Has Marcuse's criticism of America, then, no value? Whatever its value as propaganda, the truth value of his popular work — this excludes “Reason and Revolution” and “Soviet Marxism"—is negligible. As propaganda it could help bring about a fascist reaction. But Marcuse has not proved that we are oppressed, and chiefly because he has not made explicit the notion of freedom on which he bases his indictment. But for me, his work has a high value he did not intend to put into it. It was not until I began to struggle with his, prose that I fully realized how lucky we Americans are. For Marcuse the man I have developed a profound pity. Endowed with talent, learning, an enormous intellectual drive, toward the end of his life Marcuse faces, in spite of his efforts, defeat. For is this not what an activist faces whose hope of wrecking our world is based on “the kids” and the black extremists?

760-> U.S. COURT OPENS REP. DOWDY TRIAL
BALTIMORE, Nov. 8 The bribery, conspiracy and perjury trial of Representative John Dowdy, Democrat of Texas, began today with the screening of a jury panel in Federal District Court here. The 59‐year‐old former chairman of the House District Education Subcommittee is charged with accepting a $25,000 bribe to interfere with a 1965 Justice Department investigation into a now‐defunct home improvement company. Judge Roszel C. Thomson said he expected the jury screening process to continue tomorrow. Stephen H. Sachs, a former United States Attorney for Maryland, is prosecuting the case; Mr. Dowdy is bebig defended by John W. Rey Jr. of Texas and Leon H. A. Pierson of Baltimore. At a brief news conference during the lunch break today, Mr. Dowdy repeated his contention that he had been “framed.” He said, “Because it didn't happen, I am confident of being exonerated.” In March, 1970, Mr. Dowdy publicly denied the charges against him. He contended that the prosecution was depending on “witnesses who are both convicted criminals and professional con artists.” The two main witnesses are expected to be former officials of the improvement company—Myrvin C. Clark, the sales manager of the Monarch Construction Company, of Silver Spring, Md., and Nathan H. Cohen, president of the company. Clark has already pleaded guilty of paying Mr. Dowdy $25,000 at an airport in Atlanta. Mr. Cohen was named as a coconspirator in the indictment, but he was not charged. The case prompted some controversy on Capitol Hill because four of Mr. Dowdy's conversations with an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation were recorded. After the use of the recording devices was disclosed during pretrial motions, Representative Hals Boggs of Louisiana, the House majority leader, accused the F.B.I. of tapping the telephones of several other Congressmen. The indictment charges that Mr. Dowdy attempted to interfere with the investigation of Monarch, primarily by using the powers of his position as a committee chairman. Among the actions Mr.'Dowdy is accused of are taking subpoenaing papers involving the repair company's activities in Washington urban renewal programs and making photocopies of Federal Housing Administration files to pass on to Mr. Cohen. Mr. Dowdy is also accused of lying under oath to the Federal grand jury investigating his connections with the repair company. The electronic evesdropping was done with the cooperation of Mr. Cohen. It included tape recordings of two telephone conversations between Mr. Dowdy and Mr. Cohen. Judge Thomsen authorized the surveillance and said it had be approved by Attorney General John N. Mitchell and J. Edgar Hoover, director of the F.B.I. Mr. Dowdy's defense is being financed, in part; with a $21,000 contribution from the Liberty Lobby, a right‐wing organization that contends that the case is a “frame‐uy leftists who have indicted Mr. Dowdy] on a trumped‐up Federal bribery charge.” The case had been postponed six times because Mr. Dowdy has had continued health problems after a back operation in September, 1970.

763-> J. P. MORGAN'S NET UP 34% IN QUARTER
J. P. Morgan & Co., Inc., parent company of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, the nation's largest “wholesale” bank, catering almost exclusively to the corporate carriage trade, reported yesterday a 34 per cent gain in profits for the first quarter. The profit margins and rate of return on equity also improved dramatically. Income before profits or losses on securities transactions came to $30.4‐million, or $1.66 a share, up from $22.7‐million, or $1.24 a share in the same period last year. Net income, reflecting substantial profits in investment securities this year and losses last year, shot up 61.4per cent to $33.5‐million, or $1.83 a share, from $20.8‐million or $1.13 a share in the first three months of 1970. J. P. Morgan's sharp increase in profits was aided by a healthy increase of more than $5.5‐million in gross profits from day‐to‐day trading in the money market, which offset about quarter of the company's decline in interest revenues due to lower rates. But the big boost to earnings came from a drop of 26 per cent in Morgan's largest item of expense, interest payments to others, which declined to $79‐million in the first three months this year, from almost $107‐million In 1970. In its statement, the company for the first time reported gross revenues and expenses from its overseas operations. Previously it had shown only the net profits from its foreign offices as an unspecified part of its “other operating income.” By comparing the first quarter of 1970 as originally reported last year, and the restated figures for that period as published yesterday, it was possible to derive a rough estimate of J P. Morgan's business abroad in the first quarter last year. Gross revenues reported yesterday for the first quarter last year were $180.2‐million, while expenses were $140.9‐million. By contrast, the bank's statement at this time last year showed revenues of $137.8‐thillion, and expenses of $99.96‐million. Subtracting the figures originally reported from the restated numbers given yesterday, would indicate that Morgan's overseas revenues in the first quarter last year were slightly less than $41‐million. A spokesman for J. P. Morgan said yesterday evening that the surprisingly slim difference between these two figures did not necessarily give a correct indication of the company's foreign profits. J. P. Morgan's over‐all profit margin in the first three months this year — its income before securities transactions as a per cent of gross revenues — was 17.4 per cent in the first three months this year, up from 12.6 per cent last year. The rate of return on equity —net before securities dealings taken at art annual rate as a per cent of stockholders’ equity — was 15.7 per cent, up from 12.5 per cent in 1970. The First National. Boston Corporation, parent of the First National Bank of Boston, reported income before securities transactions rose 12.1 per cent in the first quarter to $11.43 million, or $1.90 a share, up from $10.19‐million, or $1.70 in the 1970 period. The net after securities transactions spurted 29.8 per cent to $13.82‐million, or $2.31 a share from $10.65‐million, or $1.78. The National Bank of Detroit said yesterday operating results before securities transactions fell 6.3 per cent in the first quarter while net income clirfibed 20.8 per cent. Profits, excluding securities transactions, fell to $9.08‐million, or $1.51 a share, down from $9.68‐million, or $1.61 a share. Net amounted to $9.83‐million, or $1.64 a share, up front $8.13‐million, or $1.36 a share.

764-> Budget Wrought by Blood and Sweat Brings Tears
Over a sandwich luncheon in Mayor Lindsay's City Hall office—ham and roast beef, with chocolate chip cookies and iced tea—Budget Director Edward K. Hamilton first explained to the Mayor and a fiscal advisory committee of five outside bankers and economists the new city taxes authorized by the State Legislature. One of the questions raised by the group at the briefing last Wednesday at noon was, “Would every interest group be hit?” The response was, “Yes, there's something for everybody.” The exceptionally complex making of the new budget submitted yesterday had already required days of computer talk between Mr. Hamilton in Albany—using a portable terminal he brought in two suitcases —and his bureau in the Municipal Building. Charter Provision Cited Under the City Charter, the Mayor's proposed budget is automatically adopted unlessl, the Council and Board of Estimate approve a different version by a deadline that this year had been extended to June 8. The Legislature failed to act on the city's package until the early hours of June 9, last Wednesday. So the 315 employes of the city's Budget Bureau, which lost 36 workers through economy layoffs effective May 1, had been putting together alternative budgets, depending on the legislative outlook, to amend the $9.13billion proposal first offered by the Mayor on April 30. Expenses Are Cut They had developed alternatives of $8.5‐billion and up, depending on legislative action, involving as little as $450‐million, then $500‐million, $550million, $600‐million and eventually the $625‐million that was approved. Then Deputy Hamilton, and the city's legislative representative, Richard A. Brown, the city's negotiators in Albany, relayed word and the Council extended its deadline for action until June 22. Mayor Richard R. Aurelio, Mr. Last Wednesday's noon briefing — with some comments on the danger in the revenue estimates—was followed by internal city group sessions that afternoon that directed the Budget Bureau to produce papers on 11 issues for the Mayor that night. At 8 A.M. Thursday at Grade Mansion, the papers came up for tentative decisions. On hand were the Mayor, Mr. Aurelio and Mr. Hamilton, Deputy Budget Directors David Grossman and James A. Cavanagh, Deputy Mayor Timothy W. Costello and three mayoral aides, Jay L. Kriegel, Gordon J. Davis and Edward A. Morrison. One issue was the Mayor's hope for a new Agency for Child Development, first set for a budget of $2‐million, mainly in Federal and state money, but with $440,000 from city taxes, to administer day‐care services. This was highly vulnerable because it was a new program. The decision was to keep it, but to cut administration expenses to $150,000, including $20,000 in city taxes. Mr. Hamilton also urged an increase in city tax allocations for payments to day‐dare centers. He said city costs for rent on a completed but unused center would not be federally reimbursed, and would actually exceed the city's share of costs for operating a center for which there would be Federal money. “I will never understand budgets,” one of those present said, and Mr. Hamilton, an unruly forelock sliding over his right temple, grinned. Housing Agency Spared There were other decisions then and at City Hall later that day—the closing of the Women's House of Detention; the reduction of the police force by attrition, but keeping up courts, prosecutors and probation; the acceptance of heavy attrition in the Sanitation Department with its relatively older force eligible for retirement. It was also decided that executive management staff slashes should be scheduled for $500,000. We always had strong view that you can't cut all Indians and not chiefs,” one participant said. Half the Budget Bureau staff ground out memorandums and impact statements for 35 agencies, working until 11 P.M. On Friday, nine agency heads made their appeals to Mr. Hamilton, more flexible on mix than on totals. The last decision was to use city tax money to finance $4.5million in housing code enforcement, rather than drop 450 employes from a program in which state aid had been trimmed. The budget staff worked again until 11 P.M. Toba Dobkin, fiancee of a public affairs aide, Andrew Barth, found herself spreading cheese on crackers for their supper instead of the night on the town for which she had come up from her Maryland day‐care center job. Mr. Hamilton worked out first draft of a budget message for the Mayor—12 doublespaced typed pages—and delivered it to a guard at the Mayor's Gracie Mansion home. It was 3 A.M. Saturday. Saturday morning at 8:30 A.M., the draft was discussed at the mansion. At 9:30 A.M., Mayor Lindsay left by his Cadillac for a drive to Philadelphia and a national meeting of Mayors. By radio telephone between the car and City Hall for that whole drive, the draft was worked over and over. With the Mayor were Mr. Kriegel and Toni Morgan, press secretary; at City. Hall were Messrs. Hamilton, Aurelio and Davis. More discussions went on when the Mayor reached the Bellevue Stratford Hotel. At 6:30 P.M., Mr. Hamilton gave the final draft for printing to Charles J. Biers, his director of administration.

765-> Crash Kills James E. Allen Jr. and Wife
PEACH SPRINGS, Ariz., Oct. 17—Dr. James E. Allen Jr., for mer United States Commis sioner of Education, and his wife were among all the 10 persons killed yesterday when a twin‐engine airplane flew into an early winter storm and crashed in rugged mountains, the president of the small air line said today. John Seibold, head of Scenic Airlines, confirmed that he had informed Dr. Robert F. Goheen, president of Princeton Univer sity, that the Aliens were pas sengers on the plane. Dr. Allen, who was 60 years old, had been a visiting lecturer this year at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Af fairs. Scenic Airlines said in Las Vegas, Nev., that it would not release a list of passengers un til the bodies were identified and the next of kin notified, probably tomorrow. A Civil Air Patrol spokesman said a helicopter crew reached the crash site today after the wreckage was spotted by an Air Force plane in an area 40 miles north of this northern Arizona community. The heli copter crew had been hampered in its effort to reach the site by heavy snowfall and poor visibility and was forced to re main there when the storm worsened. The spokesman said the bodies would probably remain at the site until a ground party made its way 10 the area, local ed in a rugged forest section known as Pine Mountain, about 60 miles east of the Arizona Nevada border. The plane, a Cessna‐402 piloted by Wayne Leeth, 44 years old, of Las Vegas, was last heard from yesterday morning when the pilot said he was returning to Las Vegas because of poor weather. The plane was on the way to the Grand Canyon on a sightseeing tour. Scenic Airlines said that two other planes also had reported poor weather and returned to Las Vegas yesterday from Arizona. A fourth plane con tinued to the Grand Canyon, but did not land. It returned to Las Vegas safely. The storm, which moved into Arizona early yesterday, dumped up to six inches of snow in the northern part of the state and forced most of the Civil Air Patrol's planes to remain on the ground. Mr. Seibold said It was the first crash in the airline's four‐ year existence. He said the company, which has a fleet of seven planes, has carried about 50,000 passengers on sightsee ing tours that originate in Las Vegas, flying the 200 miles to the Grand Canyon airport and then returning to Las Vegas. “We're at a complete loss to explain; why it happened,” Mr. Seibold said. “The pilot knew his aircraft like the back of his hand.” He said Mr. Leeth had more than 3,000 hours of flying time, and had made the round trip to the. Grand Canyon about 600 times.

767-> State Weighs Auto Insurance Changes
Youthful drivers may pay substantially more for automobile insurance than they do at present under a new rate reclassification plan under consideration by the New York State Insurance Department, it was disclosed here yesterday. At the same time, older, more mature automobile drivers may possibly be paying less for coverage than they do now if the plan is adopted in New York State. The proposed new system, already in operation in 44 states, would break up an estimated 500 to 750 classifications into which New York drivers are now separated into about 3,000 classifications. In addition, because the state is divided into 70 diferent territories, the new plan would create more than 200,000 rate categories into which a driver might be placed compared with about 3,500 to 5,000 at the present time. Michael A. Walters, associate actuary for the Insurance Services Office, representing a major segment of the industry, testified before the state insurance agency at 123 William Street that the state's present classification system assumed that unmarried male owners or operators of cars were “uniformly reckless’ until age 25, after which they become “a good adult risk.” Suggesting that this assumption was untrue, he said the industry proposal sought to separate the group into one from age 17 through 29 for single male owners or principal operators and others through age 24 who are either unmarried males that are not the principal operators of cars, married men or married women. “Seventeen‐year‐olds in each youthful operator category,” he said, “are seen as worse than any other individual year of age.” Moreover, Mr. Walters said, with each increasing year of age and maturity of driving habits, the insurance experience generally improves to a point where it is close tc that of adults at the oldest age of each youthful operator category. In a proposal similar to that of the Insurance Services Office, the Home Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the City Investing Company, said the proposed plan would “serve the public policy helping to provide a larger market for auto insurance. F. S. Mostero, senior vice president of Home, said present data suggested that male op orators under 20 would pay more than now while males between 20 and 25 would pay less. He noted, however, that many drivers now under 20 who are unable to buy coverage in the normal market because of present rates would be able to obtain coverage because of the greater rate incentive. Theodore M. Sprague, president of the New York State Association of Insurance Agents, who sell about $250‐million of auto insurance, said in a prepared statement that the new plan would enable insurers to sell to “virtually all licensed drivers — from the very best to the very worst.”

768-> Senate Panel Ends Its Questioning of Powell With No Apparent Opposition to His Court Nomination
WASHINGTON, Nov. 8—In a friendly five hours of questioning, the Senate Judiciary Committee completed its interrogation today of Lewis F. Powell Jr. with no Senator indicating opposition to his Supreme Court nomination. Liberal Democrats who had closely questioned President Nixon's other Court nominee, William H. Rehnquist, for two days last week, were apparently satisfied with Mr. Powell's responses. At several points, they stressed that the civil rights record of Mr. Powell, a 64‐year‐old Richmond lawyer, has been more liberal than that of Mr. Rehnquist, an Assistant Attorney General who once opposed a public accommodations ordinance in his home city of Phoenix, Ariz. This suggested that the liberals' strategy would be to offer no opposition to Mr. Powell, while comparing his record favorably to That of Mr. Rehnquist. Mr. Powell cleared a major hurdle early in the hearing when he answered the Senators' questions about possible ethical conflicts that might arise from the $1.3‐million portfolio of stocks and bonds held by him and his immediate family. He said that he would sell most of the stocks in companies that would be likely to come before him as litigants. But he added that he did not plan to sell about $320,000 worth of shares in the Sperry and Hutchinson Company, which he received from his father, and “two or three others” that had appreciated greatly in value. If he sold these shares,. Mr. Powell said, he would suffer “serious losses in taxes” on capital gains. But he assured the Senators that he would disqualify himself from any cases involving these companies. Mr. Powell said he had considered using a “blind trust” designed to keep him from knowing how his money was invested. But he said he dropped the idea because the canons of judicial ethics require a judge to know, and to disqualify himself from, any case that might raise a conflict. He said he would have learned the contents of any blind trust anyway when he signed his income tax forms. Three liberal Democrats —Senators Birch Bayh of Indiana, Philip A. Hart of Michigan and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts — asked most of the questions, concentrating on the nominee's views on wiretapping, governmental surveillance of political activities and civil rights. Many of the questions grew out of a strongly worded newspaper article on alleged “repression” that Mr. Powell wrote several weeks ago for The Richmond Times‐Dispatch. Commenting on the Nixon Administration's contention that it is not illegal for the Justice Department to wiretap “danierous” radical groups without court permission, Mr. Powell wrote that it was almost impossible to separate domestic subversives from foreign subversives, who have been subjected to wiretapping without court orders since the beginning of World War IL Today, Mr. Powell backed away from that position, saying that he “was, not writing a law review article” and thus did not deal with all the nuances of the issue. He said that, “in most ases, it would not be difficult” to draw a line between clothes tic and foreign subversives, and added that court approval and other safeguards could be applied to the Government's wiretapping of domestic groups in many cases. Mr Powell concluded that, despite his article, he did not have “a fixed view” on wiretapping. Thus, he said that, as of now, he saw no reason why he could not participate in the upcoming Supreme Court case concerning wiretapping of domestic groups without court authority. Asked about his statements that some, or the Warren Court's criminal law decisions had hindered law enforcement, Mr. Powell said he disagreed wih the decisions that limited police interrogation at the scene of crimes. But he added that some of the Warren Court's rulings extending the safeguards of criminal suspects “will be regarded as landmarks.” Senator Bayh released today the text of a letter he received from Attorney General John N. Mitchell, refusing to waive his attorney‐client relationship with Mr. Rehnquist. Senator Bayh has requested a waiver so that Mr. Rehnquist could testify in greater detail about controversial positions taken by him as a Justice Department official. Mr. Mitchell replied that this would set a precedent that could retard free discussion between Government employes and their superiors. At the conclusion of, the hearing, Senator James O. Eastland of Mississippi, chairman of the committee, said that two more days of hearings would probably be necessary to receive the testimony of the opponents of the two nominations. He said he would like to hold a committee hearing later ta the week to vote on both nominations. Any member of the committee can demand a one‐week delay, however. In any event, haste in committee action seems relatively unimportant because the Senate majority leader, Mike Mansfield of Montana, has indicated that he will not set aside other Senate business to permit an early vote on the nominees. Senator Mansfield has said that the nominations may not be voted upon until late this month.

769-> Ford Grants $10‐Million To Debt‐Ridden Troupes
In an effort to deal with the most persistent problem of arts organizations — a shortage of cash to meet cur rent expenses — the Ford Foundation has set up a $10‐ million grant program to aid 37 drama, dance and opera groups, it was announced yesterday. The overridihg aim of the cash‐reserve grants is to en able economically troubled organizations to cope with their accumulated deficits and to create a viable cash flow. If the new program works as intended, the or ganizations will be able to raise money for the next season instead of for the one just ended. The first series of grants provide $6‐million for 6 thea ters, 2 dance companies and 15 civic opera groups. Anoth er batch, to be announced in several months, will allocate $4‐million to 14 additional drama, dance and opera companies. The foundation has not in cluded orchestras because in 1966 it established an $80.2‐ million program for the coun try's major and metropolitan symphonies: The new grants bring the foundation's total outlay for the arts this year to $36‐million, the highest since 1966. Included arc $11.5‐million to three consei Vatories. A $7‐million grant to the Juilli ard School has been announced. The New England Conservatory in Boston will receive $3.5‐million and the Cleveland Institute of Music $1‐million, both on a match ing basis. The cash‐reserve grants have been limited at the out set to professional companies with annual budgets from $100,000 to $1‐million. Key selected groups, most of them with larger budgets, such as the New York City, Jaffrey and Pennsylvania Ballets and the Arena, Alley, Guthrie, Mark. Taper and American Conservatory Theater groups, have received grants this year under other programs. The companies and the grants under the new pro gram are: Fifteen of the 23 recipients have a total of $2,593,604 in accumulated operating deficits. To illustrate how the pro gram is expected to function, consider'the case of an opera company with a deficit of $150,000 and expenditures ?? for the new season of $400, 000. The foundation will pay 50 per cent—$75,000—of the ac cumulated deficit if the com pany raises a similar match ing fund by the end of its fiscal year. To help with cash reserves the foundation will provide 40 per cent of the operating budget, or $180,000, over a four‐year period‐15 per cent or $60,000 in fiscal 1972 and 10 per cent or $40,000 in each of the next three fiscal years. Funds withdrawn from the reserve for current oper ating expenses must be re placed at year's end with earned or contributed in come, not loans. The foundation hopes to keep arts groups from going to banks for short‐term loans to meet urgent demands such as payrolls. Interest rates are always above the prime rate of 6 per cent and have gone as high as 10 per cent. “The cash reserve grant represents a new approach to the continuing economic difficulties of nonprofit per forming arts groups,” said McGeorge Bundy, president of the foundation. “Without involving the foundation in current operating budgets, which are more properly the concern of communities sup porting the companies and of public agencies, the grants are designed to put the com panies on an even keel fi nancially by eliminating defi cits, breaking the cycle of cash‐flow crises and alleviat ing the preoccupation with accumulating liabilities.” W. McNeil Lowry, vice president for humanities and the arts, said that prepara tions for the program began in 1967, when the founda tion began to set aside budg eted funds.

771-> Agnew Denounces ‘Home‐Front Snipers’
WASHINGTON, April 1— Vice President Agnew called critics of the war in Indochina “home‐front snipers!” today and accused them of having fos tered a negative attitude to ward American combat vet erans. The Vice President said the war had been described almost daily as worthless and immoral by “some of the leading mem bers of the United States Sen ate, prestigious columnists and news commentators, academic figures, some church organiza tions, as well as assorted radi cals, draft card burners and street demonstrators.” As a result, he said, the vet erans of Vietnam “have carried a greater burden, piled on them by home‐front snipers, than any American servicemen who ever went to war.” Mr. Agnew Made the re marks In a speech to the 25th anniversary meeting of the Veterans Administration Volun teer Service, which represents volunteer workers at 165 vet erans hospitals. He did not make any refer ence in his remarks to First Lieut. William L. Galley Jr., whose conviction by a military court‐martial for the deaths of 22 South Vietnamese civilians at the hamlet of Mylai 4 three years ago has become the sub ject of widespread criticism. The Vice President spoke sev eral hours before, President Nixon ordered that Lieutenant Calley be spared imprisonment while appealing his conviction. But it was clear that Mr. Agnew regarded himself as a defender of those serving in the war. “Never mind,” he said, “that the President of the United States, the soldiers' families and close friends, most of the Congress of the United States and the great majority of other Americans do not share the masochistic, guilt‐ridden view that they are being exploited in Southeast Asia, but feel that they have served their country honorably and well. Unfortu nately, this message doesn't get through as loud and as clear as does the negative one.” The readjustment to civilian life by the 2.4 million veterans of Vietnam combat is difficult enough, Mr. Agnew said, “with out having to confront an in difference or hostility in the general public.” He said that, “incredibly, they may even find themselves stereotyped—and falsely stero typed, let me emphasize as drug addicts and cold‐blooded criminals because of the nega tive propaganda mounted by critics of the war.” The Vice President noted that one psychiarist had gone so far as to recommend that veterans be confined for three or four weeks for “psycho‐social de toxification” before rejoining the general public. “Such treatment, in my judg ment,” said Mr. Agnew, “is more appropriate for some ele ments of our civilian popula tion.”

772-> A POWER SQUEEZE TO '74 OR '75 SEEN
“Tight conditions” for elec tricity will “continue for the next two to three years” for New York City and Westches ter County customers, and not until 1974 or 1975 will there be a “comfortable reserve” again, a Consolidated Edison Company spokesman warned yesterday. Separately, the city's En vironmental Protection Admin istrator, Jerome Kretchmer, as serted that some agency should be empowered to decide who is to get electricity and under what circumstances. The city official said that “we have to begin to limit the demand on our power supply.” The Consolidated Edison spokesman, Robert O. Lehrman, vice president for public affairs, said on WOR‐TV's “New York Report” that there was “no way” to be optimistic about averting cutbacks next summer and until the completion of power plants and transmission lines planned 5 to 10 years ago but held up by controversies. Even so, Mr. Lehrman held that Consolidated Edison had “about the best reliability rec ord in New York State by a factor of some fivefold over certain other of the utilities” in terms of averting service in terruptions in an average year. As to the continuing squeeze, he said one planned intercon nection with the Pennsylvania New Jersey‐Maryland grid from Branchburg in Somerset County, N. J., to Ramapo and Millwood in New York—had been described in 1965 by the Federal Power Commission as “the most vitally needed trans mission line in the United States.” Objections by municipalities along the route, he said, mean that this line “won't be com pleted probably for another year.” The second nuclear generat ing plant at Indian Point, scheduled to produce 873,000 kilowatts, can be ready for testing early this spring in the view of its manufacturer, the Westinghouse Electric Corpo ration. But after nearly six years of construction, its op erating license is being chal lenged by six or seven groups, Mr. Lehrman said. When a million‐kilowatt con ventional generator went into operation in Ravenswood, Queens, in 1966, Mr. Lehrman said, the company's plans called for building a pumped storage plant at Cornwall, N. Y., with two million kilo watts of hydroelectric power for emergency and peaking backup. The Cornwall plant, he said, “would have been built just year later.” The Ravenswood unit has been shut down for repairs since last July 21. While the Federal Power Commission has twice issued a license for the Cornwall proj ect, conservationist objectors have appealed to the United States Court of Appeals, and Mr. Lehrman said this litigation “will take about perhaps a year and a half.” Nevertheless, Mr. Lehrman held that Consolidated Edison had moved to close these gaps by using combinations of gas turbines, conventional plants on the Hudson River and in Astoria, Queens, and expansion of nuclear projects. He asserted that “by 1975 we should have the most modern utility system in the entire country.” A “preliminary prospectus” offering new stock subscrip tions to holders of Consolidated Edison common stock cites net generating capacity as 8,974, 000 kilowatts, as of Jan. 15, and indicates future schedules as follows: Gas turbines — 636,000 kilo watts in barge‐mounted genera tors planned for service before this summer. Roseton — an oil‐fired plant being built by Consolidated Edison, Niagara Mohawk and Central Hudson near Newburgh, with a first 600,000‐kilowatt unit to be in service late in 1972 and a second 600,000‐ kilo watt unit in the spring of 1973. Consolidated Edison is to get 40 per cent of the output. Bowline — a 600,000‐kilowatt oil‐fired plant being built by Consolidated Edison and Orange & Rockland near Haverstraw, for service late in 1972 or early 1973, with two‐thirds of the output for Consolidated Edison. A second 600,000‐kilowatt unit is planned to start service in 1975, also with two‐thirds for Consolidated Edison. Astoria — an 800,000 kilo watt oil‐and‐gas fired unit to expand the Astoria plant, with Mayor Lindsay's approval, rep resenting half of a project that had been proposed for service in 1974. Nuclear Plants — Indian Point No. 2, with 873,000 kilo watts, for service in the second half of this year, and No. 3, under construction for 965,000 kilowatts, for service In 1973. An application has been filed with the Atomic Energy Com mission for a fourth nuclear generator at nearby Verplanck, at 1,115,000 kilowatts, for serv ice in 1978, and a possible fifth unit there. Transmission Lines — PJM and Southern Tier interconnec tions, the latter from Bingham ton to Ramapo in New York State, to increase capacity to transfer electricity between Consolidated Edison and other utilities by about 1,400,000 kilo watts — double the present. In his telecast interview, Mr. Lehrman said Consolidated Edison was spending $12‐mil lion in redesigning the Indian Point nuclear complex to change the plant's water intake from the Hudson River to solve problems that have led to the killing of fish. The company has also asked for a state per mit to establish a fish “stock cry” to replace any fish killed, he said. The utility vice president also said Consolidated Edison planned to make public, prob ably by next June, another 10 year plan—revised from a plan submitted to Mayor Lindsay on July 22, 1969. The earlier plan had been criticized by David E. Lilien thal, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, in a report to the Mayor commis sioned by the city but never made public by Mr. Lindsay. The Lilienthal study, dated Oct. 28, 1969, suggested that the company might be under estimating demand since its plan projected an average an nual growth of only 4 per cent starting in 1969. For the pre vious 20 years from 1948 to 1968, Mr. Lilienthal said, demand had increased at a compound annual rate of 5.8 per cent. In his WNBC ‐TV interview, Environmental Protection Ad ministrator Kretchmer said, “I think the question now is: Can the demand for power continue to grow at the rate it's been growing?” Suggesting an agency with power to decide on uses, Mr. Kretchmer attacked the World Trade Center, now under con struction, as requiring 100, 000 kilowatts and representing “probably one of the greatest environmental disasters ever perpetuated on the city.” He suggested that office buildings be built with windows that could be opened, instead of de pending on air‐conditioning. In his separate WOR‐TV in terview, Mr. Lehrman said that “people should not be using electricity needlessly.” He said Consolidated Edison had stopped advertising air‐condi tioners six or seven years ago, but about 50 per cent of the increases in electrical demand each year had been for air conditioning. Mr. Kretchmer urged a “re ordering of priorities” on days of power crises, instead of early resort to cutting off heat in subways, as occurred once this winter, or slowing sub ways, as happened once last summer.

773-> M.O.R.C. Title Race Nov. 21–27
The Midget Ocean Racing Club, composed of yachts under 30 feet in length, will hold its first national championship Nov. 21–27 in Miami. The regatta will consist of four races of 15, 127, 58 and 28 miles respectively, the longest race an overnighter across the Gulf Stream to Great Isaac Light in the Bahamas and back. The New York station of M. O. R. C., which recently reported a sense of futility in competing with yacht clubs who attract M. O. R. C. boats away from its own sponsored racing events, has called for local members to support its fall single‐handed race, set for Oct. 17 off Stamford, Conn. In a letter to M. O. R. C. members, Dick Sockol, fleet captain, wrote: “Our spring single‐handed race had four starters. The champagne was dry, chilled and sparkling. It was a terrible burden for the race committee to have to drink it, since there was no one to whom to award it. “It is important to the owners of yachts under 30 feet to preserve M. O. R.C. Otherwise, there is no spokesman for the little fellow. Unrepresented, in the company of the goldplaters and 60‐foot racing machines, who is going to listen to the owner of the 26‐foot yacht who has a grievance or point to make?”

774-> Black Legal Help For G.I.'s Is Urged
Nathaniel R. Jones, the general counsel for the Na tional Association for the Ad vancement of Colored People, called yesterday for black civilian lawyers to be sent to West Germany to defend Negro soldiers facing military trials there. This was a principal rec ommendation of a three member N.A.A.C.P. investi gating team, headed by Mr. Jones, that completed a three‐week tour of United States military bases in Ger many this weekend. Another recommendation was that the military “set up an Army ‘Philadelphia Plan’ to recruit more black offi cers” and to give more blacks “command instead of staff assignments.” The Philadel phia Plan is the name given to a Government effort to put more black workers into the building trades unions. At a news conference at the Park Sheraton Hotel, Mr. Jones said that he had found that black soldiers often had little faith in white military defense lawyers. He added: “I have talked to more than 100 white lawyers in the Judge Advocate General's of fice in Germany and they all shared a feeling of utter frus tration in getting black cli ents to confide in them.” The result, Mr. Jones said, was that the rights of many black defendants were not being fully protected. He suggested also that the Government should help de fray the cost of sending black civilian lawyers to Germany because the military “has the responsibility of providing legal counsel” in whom a defendant can freely confide. The investigation came as the result of letters the N.A.A.C.P. received from black servicemen complain ing of discrimination, Mr. Jones said, plus news re ports of racial disorders in Germany. With another N.A.A.C.P. lawyer, Melvin Boldin, and Julius Williams, the organization's director of military and veteran affairs, Mr. Jones toured bases in and around Berlin, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Mannheim, Munich, Mainz, Wiesbaden, Karlsruhe and Heidelberg. Mr. Tones said they talked to more than 500 black enlisted men plus hundreds of whites, officers and civilians. “The mood was very tense,” he said, when asked about the black soldiers, “and they are extremely apprehensive for fear that no one cares. But I also found they were willing to work for change for the better within the system,” Mr. Jones said he was optimistic “because of the determination on the part of the black G.I.'s.” “All they need is some help,” he added. The 44‐year‐old black lawyer, who had served as the deputy general counsel for the President's Com mission on Civil Disorders in 1967 and 1968, said that charges by the black sol diers of double standards of military justice had absorbed most of the lengthy “eyeball to eyeball” talks. He said the practice of pretrial confinement, where a soldier can be put into the stockade for up to 30 days before being formally charged, was being used by some “inexperienced” and “frightened” commanders to remove “so‐called black militants” from their units. While black troops amount to 13 per cent of the total American military strength of more than 300,000 in West Germany, 50 to 55 per cent of the stockade population is Negro, Mr. Jones said. Most of the soldiers in the stockade were there on pre trial confinement, Mr. Jones said, and some 30 per cent were released without being charged. He said this went far to prove the black sol dier's contention that pretrial confinement was being used by company commanders and sergeants to get soldier activists out of their units. The lawyer, who took over as the national civil rights organization's chief legal of ficer in October, 1969, had some praise for some military attempts to solve racial prob lems. He singled out Brig. Gen. George S. Patton Jr., son of the World War II com mander, for the general's or der that there was to be no pretrial confinement in his command unless he person ally approved of it. Mr. Jones said that he and his aides would immediately begin working on a full re port of his investigation that would be made to the group's executive director, Roy Wil kins, and the national board of directors. He said he hoped the or ganization would then make recommendations for action to the White House, Congress and the Pentagon. Mr. Wilkins, who attended the news conference, said when it ended that the or ganization had made similar investigations of the military since World War I and that Thurgood Marshall, a former general counsel, had made a similar trip to Korea during the Korean war. Mr. Marshall is now a United States Su preme Court Justice.

775-> CONNALLY HOLDS TALKS WITH THIEU
SAIGON, South Vietnam Nov. 1—Secretary of the Treasury, John B. Connally met with Pres ident Nguyen Van Thieu today in talks covering the future of continued American economic aid to South Vietnam and the Senate vote last week to kill the fereign assistance program. Official spokesmen said, that in the 45‐minute meeting Mr. Connally, who represented President Nixon at Mr. Thieu's inauguration yesterday, dis cussed not only the prospects for aid but also political and military affairs. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker also attended. Officials in South Vietnam, whose economy is kept afloat by American dollars, are ap prehensive over the Senate de cision on the bill, which in cluded $549‐million in economic and technical assistance for this country. Of that total, $150‐million represented a spe cial fund to offset diminished spending as a result of the de parture of United States troops. “The Senate has thrown a cloud over the whole future of Vietnam,” said one American official. “The Vietnamese are worried and are in touch with us about the prospects. We tell them that there are efforts un der way in Washington to try to revive the bill and to work out something else.” Officials said that Mr. Con nally undoubtedly discussed the aid vote with Mr. Thieu and assured him that Mr. Nixon was doing all he could to restore the program. The Senate vote does not affect military aid for South Vietnam, which is roughly estimated at $2‐bil lion a year. The news from Washington came as South Vietnam was preparing an extensive series of economic reforms, all based on the assumption that Ameri can economic aid, now totaling about $700‐million a year, would continue at the same rate for at least two years. The amount, which includes funds authorized outside the foreign aid bill, is regarded by officials here as vital to South Vietnam. “The reforms are aimed at reducing our dependence on American aid,” said a ranking Vietnamese official. “But the package assumes a declining level of aid, not a sudden cut off.” The reforms, expected to be announced next week, will in volve a change in the exchange rates of the piaster, tariff changes, and other measures viewed as essential toward strengthening Vietnam's econ omy, long wracked by, in flation, inefficiency and bureau cratic confusion. Though stressing the need for self sufficiency in his inaugural address yesterday, President Thieu made a special plea for continued United States eco nomic and military aid to en able South Vietnam to carry on the war. Earlier today, Mr. Thieu marked South Vietnam's Na tional Day, the eighth anniver sary of the overthrow of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, by go ing to a Catholic mass and then to the National Cemetery, where he placed a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier. At the cemetery, he also gave money to families of four soldiers killed in recent operations aimed at securing the area around Saigon for the inaug ural ceremony. The man who led the coup ?? against Mr. Diem, Gen. Duong Van Minh, marked the occasion with a statement call ing for a political solution to the war. He charged that the “current situation of the coun try is still more dangerous than in 1963.” The retired general, who briefly led Vietnam after the death of Mr. Diem, qual ified to run in the presidential race this year but pulled out in mid‐August because he felt Mr. Thieu was rigging the election. In a statement issued from his villa as he met with 50 of his colleagues in the coup, General Minh said that the hopes of the people for a healthy democratic govern ment had been virtually ex tinguished by President Thieu's uncontested election. He called the electihn a comedy “which no one still in his right mind could accept.”

776-> Industry Fails to Blight Chinese ‘Paradise’
HANGCHOW, China, May 22 —This lovely garden city em bracing the ethereal West Lake has been transformed into a major industrial complex. But Americans who visited Hangchow before the Com munists took control of the China mainland in 1949 will find if they return that in dustrialization has not polluted what the Hangchow people call their “paradise on earth.” The central city with a popu lation of 720,000 nestles among green, terraced hills. The people appear healthy. There are plenty of smiles. The tree‐lined streets are immaculate. Most of the popu lation walk or ride bicycles. Only a few cars, trucks and buses nose among the pedes trians, horn honking. Office buildings, shops and homes are neat and in a frugal manner extraordinarily well maintained. The factories, built since the Communist take‐over, have been situated mainly in wood ed suburbs with surrounding vegetation intensively cultivat ed as screening and to absorb fumes. Some factory chimneys trail black smoke, but a program is being pressed for better control. “We are trying to deal with pollution before it becomes serious problem,” Yang Shao shen, a municipal official, ex plained. “We are building special treatment facilities to convert waste water from factories into fertilizer for use on surround ing farms,” he said. “One paper factory converted successfully after the peasants indignantly protested that fish were dying from waste discharged. Now the peasants get fertilizer and the fish are back.” Situated in Hangchow is the Chentang truck plant, which assembles vehicles made from parts manufactured locally and shipped from elsewhere in the country. There are also iron and steel works and electronics, machine‐tool and chemical plants as well as newly opened coal mines. Hangchow remains a leading vacation mecca but no longer only for well‐to‐do Chinese and foreigners. Today along the nine‐mile shoreline of the West Lake where gondola‐like native boats glide, there are secluded pa latian homes that are believed to be the vacation retreats for top Peking officials. Chairman Mao Tse‐tung is said to have a house beside the lake. In the excellent Hangchow Hotel there are army officers and party and government of ficials who are traveling on va cation or on official missions. Occasionally a foreign delega tion passes through and West ern diplomats resident in Pe king are sometimes granted permission to vacation here. However, the mainstream of visitors consists of ordinary people. Thousands are bused into Hangchow on organized tours. Family groups also travel here from nearby cities, some riding the comfortable double decker passenger train from Shanghai. The people look relaxed and there is more diversity and col or in their dress than in Can ton, although they are in the uniform costume of jackets or blouses over trousers. The people stroll in the West Lake Park, and in the Wha Rang fish lagoon beside the Pavilion of Calm Lake and Autumn Moon they feed the foot‐long red carp that swarm to the surface for food. The visitors lounge in pavil ions of the Running Tiger Spring and sip the fragrant Lung Ching green tea of the region made with the mineral water of the spa. Two great Buddhist shrines closed during the convulsions of the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1968 have been re furbished and reopened as “his torical relics” operated by the state. Visitors swarm into the Six Harmony Pagoda, a russet‐col ored, 200‐foot, 13‐tiered tower built in the year 970, and the 1,700‐year‐old Ling Ying Temple with its magnificent gilded Buddhas. There is no sign of the dam age done to the Ling Ying Temple in 1966, when a mob of Red Guards, young ideological militants, attempted to destroy the structure, which was then functioning Buddhist shrine. They were beaten off by a rival faction of Red Guards of Hang chow after some of the temple statuary had been burned. Today Red Guards in col umns of four still march in cadence through the parks, but now they are smiling, relaxed teen‐agers who seem to be on exercise marches. The Red Guard groups, some of which wreaked the greatest, uncon trolled violence during the Cul tural Revolution, have now been merged into one disciplined, ideological youth organization devoted to peaceful pursuits. There are strikingly fewer propaganda posters here than are evident elsewhere although occasionally columns of chil idren or adults, two by two, pass by with their leaders, carrying red banners or portraits of Chairman Mao. The scene in Hangchow is one of tranquility and the people say, “Heaven above, Hangchow below.”

777-> P.S.C. MEMBER ASKS POWER RATIONING
ALBANY, May 24—A mem ber of the Public Service Com mission recommended today that no electricity be provided for buildings put under con struction or substantial modifi cation after July 1 in New York City or Westchester until Con solidated Edison is assured of adequate supplies. He also suggested that in the event of “severe or chronic power shortages” power to large buildings in Manhattan and “elsewhere in the New York City area” be cut off temporarily and on a rotating basis. Still another proposal by William K. Jones, one of the agency's five commissioners, was that power be temporarily discontinued in an emergency to customers in the less densely populated areas of Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, Staten Island and Westchester. Mr. Jones's report was made to the full commission and his recommendations will not be come effective unless the agency approves them. Before acting, it will seek reaction and assessments from New York City, Westchester, Con Ed and others who may be affected. When questioned about the report, Joseph C. Swidler, the commission's chairman, said it would be given careful con sideration. He added that the commission would be careful not to take any action “more drastic than circumstances re quire” but stressed that the city faced a serious power problem. “Some method of reconciling environmental and energy inter ests must be found so that Con Ed can get on with the job of installing power plants,” he added. He noted that “30 or 40 permits” were needed before work could start. A number of bills, including one offered by Governor Rocke feller, for streamlining proce dures for approving power plant sites are now before the Legislature. The timing of the release of the Jones report was interpreted in some quarters here as pressure for enactment of legislation of this kind. William O. Farley, acting vice president of Con Ed, said the concern had not had a chance to study the report by Mr. Jones but that his recommenda tions did “point up drastically the need for new power plants, for new transmission facilities and the need for power‐plant siting legislation.” “His report,” Mr. Jones said, “also brings into sharp focus the choices the city must face: unless power plants can be built, new building construction in the city will have to come to a halt.” At City Hall a spokesman said the city would have no comment until it had a look at the report. Mr. Jones, who presided at commission hearings on proce dures needed to meet a power emergency, conceded that his recommendation for a bar on electricity for new or substan tially‐modified buildings was drastic, but he added: “It is sheer folly to build or expand power‐consuming struc tures in an area subject to a critical power deficiency.” He also recommended voltage reductions in a crisis in steps from 3 per cent to 5 per cent to 8 per cent “to avoid the need for more drastic measures.” His report said that an 8 per cent reduction could under some circumstances damage electric motors and affect the proper use of X‐ray equipment, computers and elevators. Mr. Jones indicated that the denial of power to large struc tures such as stores, factories and office buildings would mean they would have to close, and he acknowledged the economic effect could be severe.

778-> Wage‐Price Controls?
For two years George Meany has been warning the Nixon Administration that pleas for voluntary restraint are never going to check the wage‐price spiral. Last weekend, in his strongest statement yet, the crusty A.F.L.‐C.I.O. chief set forth his conviction that mandatory controls on an across‐the‐board basis represent the only way to halt inflation. The Meany statement reflects the sense of impotence, even desperation, that grips most union heads as they approach the bargaining table these days. Membership pressure obliges them to hold out for higher and higher wage increases, even though it is clear that higher prices will swiftly eat up the wage gains and undermine job security by promoting automation or stimulating foreign competition. The latest evidence of the damage caused by the Ad ministration's refusal to move toward any clear‐cut incomes policy at all, far short of wage‐price controls, yesterday's walkout of 400,000 telephone workers. The Bell System is a nationwide monopoly, dependent on Federal and state regulatory agencies for determination of its rates. Its principal union, the Communications Workers of America, has a responsible, automation minded leadership. But that leadership has seen the sub stantial wage gains it negotiated three years ago eroded by the rising cost of living. The union's members are In a state of near‐rebellion, so much so that any pay increase, however high, would probably have faced rank‐and‐file rejection without strike. In the absence of any over‐all governmental ap proach, everyone on both the management and union side finds himself trapped in a situation that means steady deterioration of telephone service if the tie‐up proves prolonged—one in which the final bill, in any event, will have to be paid by all phone users. Elsewhere on the labor front there is a similar upsurge of pointless turmoil. The copper mines, which were shut down by a seven‐month strike three years ago, are shut down again. This time the sole issue is the industry's unwillingness to follow the inflationary pattern set by the United Steelworkers of America in its negotiations earlier this year with the can and aluminum industries. The Administration waited until after both those con tracts had been signed, then issued pious denunciations. It is perfectly evident that If copper now joins the parade there will be no slightest possibility of blocking a similarly excessive settlement in the basic steel industry when its contracts run out at the end of this month. Yet the President himself is staying out of the copper talks and has nothing more persuasive to say to the steel nego tiators than empty moralization about the need for a “constructive” settlement, whatever that may mean. The West Coast waterfront has been shut down by a longshore strike since the beginning of this month and paralysis will almost surely spread to the East Coast when agreements in New York and other Atlantic and Gulf ports expire this fall. The railroads face selective strikes, tomorrow, despite their readiness to give pay increases of 42 per cent over 42 months. The carriers’ insistence that the trainmen's union follow the lead of the engineers and other rail unions in agreeing to the abolition of archaic featherbedding practices is the only reason for this indefensible strike threat. It is incontestable that the irrationality underlying all these disruptions will not be cured without emphatic assertion of Presidential responsibility. We do not agree with Mr. Meany that putting the entire economy in the straitjacket of compulsory controls is the only prac tical answer. But the longer the situation is allowed drift, the more inescapable so drastic a remedy will become. A preferable alternative now, as we have suggested before, would be a brief freeze of all wages and prices, pending creation of a wage‐price review board to estab lish rules that would combine meaningful curbs on infla tion with the flexibility essential for a dynamic and expanding economy.

779-> MAIL‐ORDER ABUSE SCORED AT PARLEY
A persistent consumer com plaint—that some prepaid mer chandise is delayed overlong by some mail‐order companies or even fails to arrive—was the subject of a one‐day conference hero last week attended by more than 300 businessmen and government officials. Representatives of both the Better Business Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission told the gathering at the University Club, at 54th Street and Fifth Avenue, that late delivery and nondelivery of mail‐order goods was the largest single source of complaints received by both their agencies. The meeting was entitled “The Crisis of Mail Order.” Richard A. Givens, the F.T.C. regional director, particularly criticized the practice of some companies of accepting checks for merchandise they have not yet ordered from the manufac turer. His office is investigating at least one case on which cus tomers were promised that goods would be sent out within 24 hours of receipt of their or der, he said. As it turned out, some buyers waited as long as six months to get the merchan dise. Mr. Givens also said com panies that used a post office box as their sole address gave the mail‐order business a bad reputation, because customers found it almost impossible to locate the concern if they had a complaint. Those attending the confer ence later unanimously ap proved a resolution calling for a change in postal regulations to improve that situation. The proposal adopted sug gests a requirement that com panies state when they take out a box whether they will be col lecting money for mail orders. The postal office would then be authorized to give out the name and address of the boxhold er to anyone who complained. Better Business Bureau rep resentatives told the meeting that magazine and book sub scriptions, photographic serv ices, home furnishings and ap parel accounted for more than half of the late delivery and nondelivery complaints it re ceived about mail orders. Many businessmen com plained that much of the non‐ delivery problem in mail order sales could be traced to in creasing thefts within post of fices themselves.

780-> FACILITY MAY AID SUBATOMIC STUDY
MOSCOW, Oct. 17 — French and Soviet officials have for mally inaugurated a gigantic nuclear research installation south of Moscow, opening new prospects in the study of sub atomic particles in conjunction with the world's biggest atom smasher, already in operation nearby. The new installation, is a liquid hydrogen bubble cham ber as high as a five‐story building. The bubble chamber, which was manufactured at the French nuclear research center of Saclay near Paris, was disman tled and shipped to the Soviet nuclear accelerator at Serpu khov, 50 miles south of Mos cow, as part of a continuing program of Soviet‐French col laboration in high‐energy phys ics research. The French installation, which has been five years in develop ment and construction, is ex pected to increase the effec tiveness of the original ring shaped accelerator, about one, mile in circumference, which has been in operation since 1967. Known technically as a pro ton synchrotron, it accelerates, protons—the nuclei of hydro gen atoms—to an energy of about 70 billion electron volts (BEV) before they smash into a target material to produce the collisions that are used in the investigation of subatomic par ticles. The French‐made bubble chamber, built at the end of long gallery about a third of a mile from the circular accelera tor, is expected to open up new possibilities in these stud ies by increasing the chances that protons accelerated by the circular atom smasher will hit other protons in the liquid hydrogen of the chamber. Bubble chambers derive their name from the fact that they are used to study matter by photographing “bubble trails” left behind by minute and elu sive subatomic particles as they decay. The liquid hydrogen, which is kept near its boiling point at a temperature of minus 250 degrees Centigrade, offers max imum density of hydrogen atoms and this enchances the probability of proton‐proton collisions. According to an account by Tass, the official Soviet press agency, the 3,000‐ton chamber contains seven cubic meters of liquid hydrogen. The protons accelerated by the circular atom smasher will have straight flight of about one‐ third of a mile from the time they leave the ring until they hit the chamber. In this gallery the Soviet French research team hopes to produce a beam of antiprotons, which may help clarify the re lationship between the many particles of matter and anti matter that have been discov covered in recent years in smaller atom smashers. Particles of antimatter such as antiprotons are mirror im ages of particles of matter in their electric charge or other properties. They are annihilat ed when they meet bits of matter.

782-> For Young Readers
“There was a poor young boy who left his country home/And came to the city to seek employment,” recounts the grand old W. C. Fields number, and everyone knows what traps and trials await youthful innocence in the sinful city. Nearly as prominent in folk tradition is the urban easterner‐gone‐west. Newest addition to the westward procession is 14‐year‐old Marianne Temple. Arriving by air in Missoula, Mont., Marianne faces the unknown with a tape recorder, a gunbelt (albeit a toy one) and a large load of resentment at being thus packed off to visit a grandmother she hasn't seen since she was 2. Like every dude since Balboa, Marianne is confounded by the West. Grandmother Katherine Carter turns out to be a retired actress. Her house is not “like the one in but a gabled Victorian residence full of antiques where she dines each evening with candlelight and wine. Katherine's hired hand is a college‐bound native American named Oliver Everybodylooksat, a kindly and self‐reliant individual nei ther wild‐eyed nor picturesque. Marianne's months in Montana are packed with enough action to satisfy any TV fan. They center on a conflict between Oliver and a bigoted under‐sheriff (more Bull Connor than Bat Masterson), and include a barn‐burning, false arrest and a dramatic hunting accident. Counterpoint to these events is Marianne's slowly unfolding realization that her parents are planning a divorce. The spectrum of her reactions nicely complements her growing affection for Katherine and friendship with Oliver, so that in the end her departure is as unwilling as had been her arrival. Though the story does not pretend to offer any great depth of insight into personalities and situations, the narrator's voice (Miarianne's) has made the most of a brisk and, lively surface. However, one reservation must be registered. For a with‐it kid like Marianne, some initial tenderfoot‐type gaffes are just plain incredible. No one who writes outraged letters‐tothe‐editor about pollution (signed E Pluribus Unum) can convincingly make remarks like “I didn't know Indians went to college.” Caviling aside, this is an exceptionally readable story and possesses one further shining, if negative, virtue. For once in fiction the nonequestrian tenderfoot stays that way to the end, instead of winning the junior trophy in the local rodeo during the last chapter.

785-> Sience/Medicine
Some 2,500 years ago, the Chinese practiced an elab orate form of medical treat ment that called for the sticking of needles into vari ous parts of the body. The needles, of differing sizes and thicknesses, were inserted at points defined by maps of the body surface. And the technique, called acupunc ture, was used to cure all manner of ailments: head aches, stomach pains, paral ysis, rheumatism, heart palpitations, appendicitis, nervous disorders, mental illness—even blindness. Last week Western news men, visiting China for the first time in many years, dis covered that acupuncture is not only still in wide practice, but is being emphasised more strongly than ever ‐by the Chinese Communist Govern ment. In Tientsin, the reporters saw the technique applied to a husky young woman with a stomach pain. The doctor pulled 12 needles from her stomach, left leg and knee joint. “I feel much better,” she said as she got up from the bed. “It didn't hurt at all.” The premise upon which acupuncture is based is that there are invisible channels or canals under the body's surface through which the forces of yang and yin run. Yang represents the male, or positive, elements and yin the female, or negative, elements. It is claimed that the needles cure or help by influencing the pattern of these forces. The explanation offered the newsmen by a Chinese doctor was that the effectiveness of the treatment can be traced to a stimulation of the nerves. Chinese doctors trained in Western‐type medicine no longer deprecate acupuncture, it is said, as they did in the past. And they report that practitioners of Western medicine and acupuncture cooperate to use both systems to best effect. In fact, since the ancient treatment re quires less training than Western medicine, China's millions of new “barefoot doctors” use it extensively. These are medical personnel with practical qualifications rather than with top‐level college educations. While Western physicians are apt to be highly skeptical of acupuncture, many believe that it should not be dis missed out of hand. Some have suggested that acupunc ture works because of its patients' faith in it, that it is a form of psychosomatic medicine. Others have raised the possibility that the needles stimulate the autonomic ner vous system or increase the production of antibodies against infection. But there seems to be general agree ment that any firm conclu sion about the treatment must await scientific research to find out if acupuncture really works, and, if so, why. Acupuncture is also popular in Japan, Hong Kong, Viet nam and other areas in fluenced by Chinese culture. French physicians returning to France from Vietnam in the early 1950's introduced the practice, and it has also had some vogue elsewhere in Western Europe. The late Aldous Huxley was an ad vocate. One of the Western re porters asked a Chinese doctor if the treatment could cure a hangover. “Yes, cer tainly,” he replied.

786-> London Ground Crews Battle Airport Police
LONDON, Nov. 1 (AP) — More than 12,000 travelers were stranded at Heathrow Airport here today when ground crews staged a sud den walkout that virtually crippled the airport, battling with policemen, tossing bag gage into the air and storm ing an office. Some 40 people were ar rested after hundreds of crewmen tried to smash through 200 policemen who had formed a cordon around an Iberian Airlines jetliner. Some of the policemen had dogs with them. British European Airways canceled more than 145 flights; Swissair canceled three; Scandinavian Air Serv ice scratched half a dozen. U.S. airlines managed to con tinue most of their scheduled flights, but with long delays. The crewmen charged that Iberia threatened their jobs by awarding a ground‐han dling contract to a Canadian owned company, Ground Air Services.

788-> Black Women Take Roles as Directors
In theatrical and film direction, where women of any race have been rare, at least five black women have emerged here as significant new voices in the shaping of black consciousness. While none has directed on Broadway, two have created their own Off Broadway theater companies, where they are training a new generation of black and ‘minority group actors, dancers, singers, designers, choreographers and musicians, and one has established a “ritualistic” theater, based on African rather than European models. All have presented works that were well received by the major critics, and two of these women were recently signed to direct featurelength motion pictures. The women, Vinnette Carroll, Shauneille Perry, Maya Angelou, Novella Nelson and Barbara Ann Teer, are not new to the theater; indeed, their skills embrace almost the entire spectrum of the arts. Working on Film Miss Carroll, actress, director, producer and mother hen to a generation of black mformers, sees the rise of black women into the directoral ranks as a natural outgrowth of the new black consciousness. “When I started out in the fifties,” the ebullient founder and director of the Urban Arts Corps theater on West 20th Street said, “there were no black women directors because there were almost no black playwrights and no black theater to speak of. Now we are getting the playwrights and everything else is bound to follow.” Miss Carroll, who will begin directing “Sweet Jesus,” a Christmas film set in Harlem, on the day after Thanksgiving, also traces the development to the traditional freedom of black women. “Black women never had any of the problems about their roles that white women “have,” she explained. “Black women always worked and felt they had more in common with black men than with white women. I think white women were probably less inclined to try things traditionally considered to be male provinces.” Similar views were expressed by Miss Perry, Miss Angelou and Miss Nelson, all of whom have or shortly will have directorial credits. Miss Perry is a graduate of the Royal Academy of Drama in London and has taught drama and speech in several American colleges and universities. She recently directed “Black Girl” at the Theater de Lys and is now working on “The Sty of the Black Pig,” which opens on Tuesday at the Negro Ensemble Company's theater in the East Village. Miss Angelou, a statuesque singer, dancer, author and poet, who has been signed to direct the film based on her prize‐winning autobiography, “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” felt the emergence of women directors “just follows —nothing grows without roots. It is an accumulation of the black struggle, one of its fruits.” Directing for Papp Miss Nelson, a singer and actress, who last June directed “Nigger Nightmare,” what she hopes will be the first of many plays for Joseph Papp's Public Theater, believes that it is a natural development for artists who want to grow to move into more challenging roles. On the other hand, Miss Teer, a University of Illinois graduate, accomplished dancer, composer and winner of a Vernon Rice Award for an outstanding Off Broadway performance, doesn't even want to be called a director, despite the fact that she is the founder and head of the revolutionary National Black Theater, which eschews traditional drama for a ritual theater based on African culture. “To direct is limiting,” Miss Teer commented. “I don't use people, tell them to move from here to there. Therefore, I'm not a director. “I gave up acting because I couldn't be directed. No one could tell me what had to be done, because I knew better than anyone else. I don't direct people, I help them to liberate themselves, to free their creative powers through ritual, through dance, music and poetry. And along the way, we help to liberate our audiences.” ‘Sensitive, Creative People’ In Miss Teer's theater, actors are, called liberators and she refers to herself as a creator or a priestess. She said black women had moved into responsible positions in the theater for the same reason that black men had—“because black people are sensitive, creative people and it is only natural that they should when opportunities arise.” None of the women ad mitted to having any problems directing men, their view being that actors, most actors anyway, like to work and will respond to anyone who can help them function better. But Miss Teer expressed annoyance with contemporary black playwrights, who, she said, create unsympathetic and often degrading roles for black women. “It's part of the total culture,” she declared heatedly. “Men don't know how to behave toward women, don't understand us as sensitive human beings. They're always portraying us as prostitutes, who slink ridiculously around the stage, or as hateful people. That's why I've created my own theater.”

789-> Rudo Bird Triumphs by a Nose Over Red Reality on Aqueduct Truf
Only the margin of a nose prevented the Cragwood Stable from scoring its third straight victory in the Long Island Handicap at Aqueduct yester day, as its Red Reality was beaten by William A. Levin's Rudo Bird. Rudo Bird; racing as the $8.20‐for‐$2 third choice with his stablemate, Close Attention, snapped the Cragwood string with a display of stubbornness that won high praise from Jorgé Velasquez, the 4‐year‐old gelding's jockey. “My horse just wouldn't give up,” said the Latin rider after his mount had held on to a razor‐thin lead in the closing yards. The issue was so close in the $35,350 contest over the 13–16‐mile turf course that few in the damp crowd of 34,806 felt sure of the outcome. Even Velasquez and Chuck Baltazar, aboard Red Reality, had doubts. Baltazar was so curious that he rushed into the jockey's room after weighing out to watch the race's final phases on a filmed rerun. He slapped Velasquez's open palm in a friendly gesture — just as football players do after a touchdown—as he watched the outcome. It revealed that while Red Reality had plenty of late foot, so did Rudo Bird. And while it seemed almost certain that the Cragwood color‐bearer was going to catch his rival in the final strides, Red Reality seemed to lack the final drive in a race run in 2:03 1–5. Thus was Cragwood's dom ination of the fixture ended. Two years ago, Red Reality, as a 3‐year‐old, captured one of two divisions of the Long Island Handicap. Last season, it was Larceny Kid who car ried Cragwood's colors into the winners' circle in the second of two divisions. Yesterday, Red Reality, con ceding 7 pounds to Rudo Bird, who toted 109, was far from humbled. Kept well back of the pace along with Rudo Bird, the Cragwood performer moved from last (eighth place) to third rounding the turn. The only drawback, as it de veloped, was that Rudo Bird, who had been tucked in the seventh spot and then the sixth, moved right along with him.

790-> FOREIGN AFFAIRS
MORONI, Comoro Archipelago—With the exception of the Portuguese empire, which lingers on like some political dodo bird, there are few imperial relics left in this revolutionary age and it is questionable whether any, even British Gibraltar or French Djibouti, have real value. Rather, for the most part, the vestiges of empire that still dot odd corners are either too weak, too poor or simply too tiny to aspire to independence and prefer, on the whole, to remain attached to old if distant masters rather than risk being seized by new ones. This will almost surely prove the case with the Comoro Archipelago off Africa's eastern coast that is still considered an integral part of France and, although autonomous, is ruled in fact by a French official. Whether these impoverished, illiterate islanders want full freedom is the main issue in elections next summer. In Tanzania, west of here, there is a Comoro liberation movement called Molinaco, which demands an end to French ties and protests against training or the Foreign Legion here. But some Comorians claim Molinaco is merely a front for Communist powers who would like to take over and turn this archipelago into another puppet Zanzibar. Such remnants of colonialism as exist today in outposts like Tahiti or the Falklands make one ponder: Was the colonial era wholly bad and what did its leading exponents bequeath to the people they once ruled? The British stressed law and order, the French stressed culture and the Belgians stressed economics during their imperial heydays. While each experienced a brief period of hatred during the revolutionary processes that produced liberation, this was succeeded by a kind of love and frequently by a form of renewed, voluntary dependence. The British are now liked and respected in such former colonies as Burma or Cyprus; the French are immensely admired and relied upon in Madacascar or Senegal; and even the Belgians, once derided for authoritarian rule, are today regarded by the enormous Congo as the best of friends. King Baudouin, who has close relations with Congolese President Mobutu, believes Belgium's emphasis on building a broad economic infrastructure made possible the immense republic's evolution following initial chaos. The British take pride in ungrudging acknowledgment by new nations that London ?? ?? ?? for civil administration. And the impress of France's culture remains dominant not only in ex‐colonies like Madagascar or Tunisia where French is the lingua franca but even in Mauritius, taken from Paris by London more than 150 years ago. Leopold Senghor, Senegal's poetPresident, once told me: “We inherited both qualities and defects from France. The Anglophone states were better off in practical and economic ways but the French taught us to go beyond prejudice. I am a Catholic but we represent less than 10 per cent of the Moslem population. And my wife is white and French—yet that doesn't count against me here.” One unexpected inheritance from erstwhile imperial masters is what Malian statesman named Ba called “a new kind of slavery, the slavery of the appetite.” He means that every fledgling country feels, even if it cannot afford the luxury, that it must boast embassies abroad, armies, broadcasting networks, an airline and other external trappings that once pertained only to their European overlords. One of the worst colonial legacies was a cockeyed set of artificial frontiers. Borders drawn in Europe to suit the convenience of rival statesmen before two world wars are often wholly unrealistic, bisecting tribal areas in Africa, ignoring geographical features in Latin America, or producing crises through careless cartography in Asia. History is likely to regard European imperialism as far less civilizing than Kipling imagined but also far less harmful than was argued by Lenin. It unquestionably served a purpose in spreading the habits of modern government, the bases of international culture and the foundations of an industrial economy—even if it was harsh and frequently gummed up the map. Colonialism has almost run its course because the Western powers, save for Portugal, recognized that neither physically nor morally can they hope to maintain the responsibilities once assumed—that is to say, except for one massive European nation, Russia. Moscow still insists upon its own civilizing mission in non‐Slavic Turkoman or Persian tracts and also (like Lisbon) contends that these subject peoples prefer to be provinces of foreign capital.

791-> International No Windfall For OTB or for the Bettor.
Yesterday's $150,000 Wash ington D.C. International in Maryland caused an intriguing, if moderate, stir of interest here among offtrack bettors. Despite a flurry of advertis ing over the weekend, the Off track Betting Corporation gen erated a handle of only $87,571 for its one‐day “special” on the 1½‐mile race at Laurel Race Course. However, the $2.80 offtrack payoff on Run the Gantlet re flected a sharp departure from patterns established in OTB's previous separate‐pool ven tures on the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes. In those events, favorites got comparatively less play with OTB than at the track, long shots comparatively more play. Yesterday, big‐money off‐track customers in search of a bar gain apparently decided Run the Gantlet could be it. They guessed wrong. Of the $58,540 wagered here to win on the International, $33,075 went on favored Run the Gantlet. He was 2 to 5 here, 4 to 5 at Laurel. As a result, the Rokeby Sta ble colt returned twice as much profit for those who bet him at the track or with bookmak ers ($3.60 for $2) than he did for the OTB bargain‐hunters. On the other hand, five of the eight remaining contestants would have paid more with OTB than at the track. Action at OTB's 26 offices and one phone room was limit ed to win and exacta wagering. In the exacta, only $29,031 was risked here — another indica tion that big bettors were inter ested primarily in getting a first place windfall on Run the Gantlet. The OTB exacta of Run the Gantlet and Irish Ball (let ters C and D) returned $26.20 for $2, or 60 cents less than the same combination paid at Laurel. Yesterday's operation lacked the festive novelty of OTB's pools on the Triple Crown rac es, each of which involved four days of manual ticket‐selling at special windows, Bets on the In ternational were taken by com puter from 8 A.M. to 3:15 P.M. at all the windows, along with the regular daily action on rac es at Aqueduct and Yonkers Raceway. Whether from the rain, the partial holiday or the Interna tional, regular offtrack wager ing on Aqueduct races suffered. The OTB handle there yester day was $261,704, compared with $379,643 the previous Monday. With far fewer betting sites, OTB handled $1,030,432 on the Kentucky Derby last May, $1,151,686 on the Preakness and $1,176,898 on the Belmont Stakes. Unfamiliarity with the horses and a lack of television also may have inhibited off track wagering on the Inter national. OTB had hoped to ar range a telecast, but the net works were cool and finan cial negotiations with Laurel fell through. Except for large, blue entry sheets erroneously labeled “Laurel Invitational,” betting at the OTB shops yesterday was no different from any other day. Cougar II was listed on the sheet, though he had been scratched the day before. Jorge Velasquez was designated as Chompion's rider, though Vel asquez rode yesterday at Aque duct. If Run the Gantlet attracted the big bettors, he scared off some of the small ones. “His odds are too short,” said Mario Bottino, a Brooklyn bar tender. “I'd rather bet some exactas at Aqueduct or the daily double.”

CHERRY HILL, N. J., Oct. 25 (AP)—H. P. Oliver's Careerist and Buckland Farm's Sea Saga won divisions of the Vineland Handicap for fillies and mares before a crowd of 21,033, at Garden State Park today. Slated to be run on the grass for the first time, the split fix ture reverted to the main course because of slippery foot ing, caused by rain. The first di vision had a net value of $42, 200. The second division was worth $41,450. Careerist, under Carlos Bar rera, won the first division by eight lengths. Able Jan was sec ond a length ahead of Gem Wood Betty. It was nine lengths back to the favorite, Helen Jen nings, in the field of seven. The winner was timed in 2:04 ⅘ for the sloppy 1¼ miles under 110 pounds. The winner paid $13.40 for $2 straight. Only five started in the sec ond division and Carlos H. Mar quez got Sea Saga's nose in front of Kittiwake. Third was Nurse Mada. Sea Saga paid $4.40 to win, and was timed in 2:06.

MONTPELIER, Vt., Nov. 16— Richard W. Mallary, a 42‐year‐old Fairlee dairy farmer, won the Republican nomination for Vermont's lone seat in the House of Representatives today in a special primary. Mr. Mallary, former Administration Secretary of Vermont, won the nomination in a race against five other Republican contenders. He is favored to win the Jan. 7 special election. With all 246 precincts reporting, unofficial returns showed Mr. Mallary with 15,011 votes to 10,833 for Secretary of State Richard C. Thomas. State Senator Jhn T. Alden had 5,660; State Senatr Fred Westphal had 4,515, while two political unknows—John Buik and George Abbott—had 417 and 278, respectively. Probate Judge J. William O'Brien, 45, of Chittenden County, defeated three other Democrats for his party's nomination. The special election today stemmed from the death of Senator Winston L. Prouty on Sept. 10. Representative Robert T. Stafford, Republican, was appointed to fill the Senate vacancy.

794-> IN THE NATION
WASHINGTON—“A promise to dis cuss means nothing from the North Vietnamese,” President Nixon said at his news conference. Maybe not, but would be hard to prove it the way the President tried to do. Mr. Nixon gave as a basis for his statement the fact that the North Viet namese had failed to honor President Johnson's expectation that they would “negotiate seriously on ending the war,” an expectation that had caused Mr. Johnson to halt the bombing of the North in 1968. In fact, Mr. Johnson ordered the bombing stopped as part of a tacit un derstanding that Hanoi would no longer shell South Vietnamese cities or violate the demilitarized zone, and that it would permit the Saigon regime to join the Paris negotiations for what Clark Clifford, who was then Secretary of Defense, later termed “substantive talks.” It is still disputed whether. Hanoi also undertook not to attack American reconnaissance planes flying over North Vietnam. No one contends that the North Vietnamese have seriously violated the “understanding” by shelling the cities or crossing the DMZ. On the other hand, Mr. Nixon has breached the un derstanding— the only substantive achievement at Paris—by resuming bombing in the North either on the reconnaissance plane question or in response to what he considered threat ening troop and supply movements. As for “substantive talks,” while there certainly have been none since the “understanding” of 1968, neither Saigon nor Washington has a much better record than Hanoi. For Mr. Nixon to demand mutual withdrawal of foreign troops (including North Vietnamese) and free elections to de termine the South Vietnamese Govern ment is as unacceptable in Hanoi as Washington finds the Communists' proposals. It takes two sides who want an agreement to produce “substantive talks” or “serious negotiations.” In, the Paris talks, there have more nearly been two sides each of whom wanted to negotiate a substantial advantage the other. Mr. Nixon apparently thought that that was what Hanoi was doing when it proposed this week that “we discuss the question of fixing the date for the withdrawal from South Vietnam of United States forces ... so as to be able then to take up the question of the guarantee of the security of the United States soldiers during their withdrawal, and the question of the release of the prisoners of the captured troops...” So the President replied defensively that “any action on our part of ending American involvement completely” would require “not just the promise to discuss the release of our prisoners, but a commitment to release our prisoners.” In fact, it had not been suggested that he take any action to “end Ameri can involvement completely”—only that he discuss the possibility of set ting a date for such action. Obviousty, he would not actually agree to such a date until he got in return the kind of commitment he could accept for the prisoners' release. Perhaps Mr. Nixon's negotiators are exploring the possibilities of the North Vietnamese statement more thor oughly than his statement suggested; this is to be hoped, because the Presi dent in his news conference seemed to offer the possibility of flexibility, on his own part. Three times he said that Ameribans would not completely depart South Vietnam until that country had devel oped a “chance” to defend itself; once he added the proviso that it also have a “chance” to choose a government by free election. This repeated the formu lation of his April 7 statement, and represented a slackening in the stiff “self‐determination” rhetoric of the past. Moreover, Mr. Nixon specifically denied that he planned, as has often been charged, a “Korean” solution in South Vietnam, with a residual Ameri can force guaranteeing its continuing survival non‐Communist state. None of that may have any more meaning than Mr. Nixon said Hanoi's latest proposal had; and even if did, Hanoi may prove as skeptical of him as he is of Hanoi. Both Governments have ample reason—and no doubt ample will—to mistrust each other. Even so, with Hanoi expressing a willingness, however hedged and guarded, to talk about releasing the prisoners and guaranteeing the security, of withdrawing American troops, and with Mr. Nixon apparently holding out for a mere “chance” of South Viet nam's survival, it is hard to see bow much could be lost by the most ex tensive explorations at Paris and else where. It is true that there Is no guarantee in Hanoi's latest proposal that certain ends will be achieved; but neither does there seem to be any irrevocable com mitment that the United States is asked blindly to make. And despite Mr. Nixon's denunciation of Hanoi's promises, it remains a fact that the two countries did once reach an “un derstanding” on matters about which each had seemed intractable. It does not therefore seem beyond the realm of possibility that on the questions of withdrawal and prisoner release some such tacit understanding might again be developed. That in its turn might well lead to more substan tive talks about the future of Indo china, including that “chance” of the South Vietnamese regime's survival for which Mr. Nixon now says he is fighting the war.

795-> U.S. Strength in Vietnam Is Lowest in Six Years
SAIGON, South Vietnam, Nov. 1 (AP)—American troop strength in South Vietnam dropped below 200,000 to day for the first time in near ly six years. The United States com mand said the force in the war zone decreased by 5,300 men in the last week to 196,‐ 700—the lowest since Janu ary, 1966. At its peak in 1969 the total was 543,000. The headquarters of Gem Creighton W. Abrams also announced that 13 Army units totaling 1,335 men, were pulled out of combat. Battlefields in South Viet nam remained quiet. It was disclosed that United States air strikes had dropped to the lowest level of the year, with tactical fighter‐bombers aver aging 10 missions a day and B‐52's flying only two mis sions in South Vietnam in nine days.

796-> Shame of the Catholics, Shame of the English
To be at the same time a Catholic and an Englishman is today to be ashamed on both counts. As a Catholic one is ashamed that more than a thousand years of Christianity have not abated the brutality of those Catholic women who shaved a yoUng girl's head and poured tar and red lead over her body because she intended to marry an English soldier. As an Englishman the shame is even greater. “Deep interrogation”—a bureaucratic phrase which takes the place of the simpler word “torture” and is worthy of Orwell's “1984”—is on a different level of immorality than hysterical sadism or the indiscriminating bomb of urban guerrillas. It is something organized with imagination and a knowledge of psychology,, calculated and cold‐blooded, and it is only half condemned by the Compton probe. Mr. Maudling, in his blithe jolly, style, reminiscent of that used by defenders of corporal punishment when they remember their school days, suggests that no one has suffered permanent injury from this form of torture, by standing long hours pressed against a wall, hooded in darkness, isolated and deprived of hearing as well as sight by permanent noise, prevented in the intervals of the ordeal from sleep—These were the methods we condemned in the Slansky trial in Czechoslovakia and in the case of Cardinal Mindszenty in Hungary. Slansky is dead; he cannot be asked by Mr. Maudling how, permanent was the injury he suffered, but one would like to know the opinion of the Cardinal on methods which when applied by Communists or Fascists we call “torture” and when applied by the British become down‐graded to “ill treatment.” If I, as a Catholic, were living in Ulster today I confess I would have one savage and irrational ambition—to see Mr. Maudling pressed against a wall for hours on end, with a hood over his head, hearing nothing but the noise of a wind machine, deprived of sleep when the noise temporarily ceases by the bland voice of a politician telling him that his brain will suffer no irreparable damage. The effect of these methods extends far beyond the borders of Ulster. How can any Englishman now protest against torture in Vietnam, in Greece, in Brazil, in the psychiatric wards of the U.S.S.R., without being told, “You have a double standard: one for others and another for your own country.” And after all the British tortures and Catholic outrages, what comes next? We all know the end of the story, however long the politicians keep up their parrot cry of “no talk until violence ends.” When I was young it was the same cliché they repeated. Collins was “a gunman and a thug.” “We will not talk to murderers.” No one doubts that, it was in our power then to hold Ireland by force. The Black and Tans matched the republicans in terror. It was the English people who in the end forced the, politicians to sit down at table with “the gunman and the thug.” Now too, when the deaths and the tortures have gone on long enough to blacken us in the eyes of the world and to sicken even a Conservative of the right, there will inevitably be a temporary truce and a round‐table conference—Mr. Maudling or his successor will sit down over the coffee and the sandwiches with representatives of Eire and Stormont, of the I.R.A. and the Provisional I.R.A. to discuss with no preordained conditions changes in the constitution and in the borders of Ulster. Why not now rather than later?

797-> 500 Blocks Reported Cleared of Rats This Year
Health Services Administra tor Gordon Chase reported yes terday that rats were eradi cated in 500 of the city's most infested blocks during the first six months of this year. These blocks are in five “target areas,” slum communi ties containing a total of nearly 2,000 square blocks: Harlem, 284 blocks; Lower East Side, 260; South Bronx, 368; Bedford‐ Stuyvesant, 351; and Browns ville, 714. At the same time, Mr. Chase pointed to “impressive produc tivity gains over last year” in the Health Department's rat‐ control program. The coordi nator of the program is Paul Elston, assistant commissioner in charge of environmental health services. The number of buildings in spected per man‐day rose from 5.5 in the first quarter of 1970 to 15.6 in the second quarter of this year and was 17.7 in the month of June, Mr. Chase said. This lowered the inspection cost from $10 a building to $3.11. Garbage totaling 8,449 tons was removed from the 500 blocks during the six months, three times the amount removed during the same period last year. In the final phase of the pro gram—extermination—rat poi son was spread in 34,207 biuld ings in the last six months, compared with 15,648 during the same period last year. At a news conference yester day, Mr. Elston was asked how he could be sure the program was effective. Was it not pos sible, he was asked, that by cleaning up one block and spreading poison there, the Health Department was merely driving the rats to adjoining blocks? Very little chance of that, replied Mr. Elston. “The aver age rat doesn't move more than 150 feet from the place where he was born,” he said. Further, he asserted, when a new food is introduced to a rat pack, the pack allows one rat to try it and then watches him for a day or so. If he dies, no other rat will touch the food. If he does not, the whole pack devours it. The Health Department, Mr. Elston said, uses a bait called Warfarin, an anticoagulant that takes about three days to kill the rat, by internal bleed ing. Thus, by the time the “of ficial taster” is stricken, the other rats have long since lost their fear and eaten the poison, too. The department is currently making a “recidivism” study to determine how soon rats can be expected to return to a block once it has been cleared. A preliminary survey of a small sample showed that after six months 30 per cent of the blocks had experienced no reinfestation. Mr. Elston said community cooperation had been particu larly strong in these blocks. Picking up this theme, Mr. Chase remarked: “With that kind of help from the com munity, this program ought to be able to phase itself down and out.” The blocks to which rats have returned will be attacked again, Mr. Elston said, start ing next week with the two target areas in Manhattan and one in the Bronx. Mr. Chase said that the pro gram currently employed more than 590 residents of the tar get areas, many of whom had been considered unemployable because of their lack of edu cation and marketable skills.

798-> Stage: Caught in the Sway of a Sea‐Changed Pinter
The past then is another country, a landscape vague with memories, forgotten like Freud, sea‐changed with the deep realization of present realities. I am talking about Harold Pinter's new play, “Old Times,” which opened last night at the Billy Rose Theater, and is the finest play yet of a master dramatist and lends its luster to a New York season that so far needs all the luster it can acquire. But by the standards of any season, past, present or future, this is a marvelous play, beautiful, meaningful and lyric. A joyous, wonderful play, that people will talk about as long as we have a theater. It is a play about the past, or rather a man meeting his past. Pinter's ideas leap madly like March hares in desperate need of April. Silence falls upon silence like rose petals pretending to be a slender snowstorm. A man and his wife—waiting quietly in an English country cottage, drenched with the chic of good, honest taste and the exquisiteness of Sunday newspaper color supplements. A woman arrives—strange, from Italy. She knew the wife, lived with her, indeed, 20 years ago, but now the dolce vita has drawn them apart, and yet now she returns. She knew the wife — in some way, in some specially intimate way. She knew the way she took baths and the films she once liked. And perhaps she knew the husband. The husband says he knew her. He had seen her, often he says, in a pub, and then once at a party. He was drinking light ale and trying to assess the impenetrable secrets of her legs. Yes, they seem to have known each other, some time 20 years ago, in another world —when, perhaps, they were other people. They chatter away in silence. They murmur their halfarticulated, Joycean thoughts, like the people in Pinter's earlier “Landscape” aril “Silence,” and the intensity of the writing makes too much concentration on it almost dangerous. Pinter's plays are hand grenades thrown into the perilously conscious subconscious. Three people meeting. Three people? Perhaps only two people. Perhaps just a man and a woman and his memories of that woman, or his hopes of that woman, or his fantasies of that woman. Or perhaps a woman and her lover and then the man who loved both. Or perhaps … but what we have here are intertwining memories Of the past, a collage of ponderable trivialities agglomerating, almost by chance, into a statement. This was Proust's way, yet memories change and verbal coinages tinkle a different tune. Where were we when—where were the tunes we sang, the places we met, the silent, eye‐grasping understandings we shared? Where was that country, bounded by the reverberations of a map we now no longer quite recognize? We remember of course—very clearly —how great, let us or Pinter say, how Robert Newton was in “Odd Man Out.” But do we not need to be reminded—as Pinter reminds us—that F. J. McCormick was good, too? Memory is a fallible defense against the past. Pinter's little mysteries tease us into comprehension. They make us uncertain, and yet uncertainty is precisely what they are vaguely about. You can discuss his plays and learn nothing. The value of Pinter is that he is a playwright who can be experienced only in the cool instant of the theater. He is nothing more than honest magic—a come‐as‐you‐are party of the heart. In this new play, “Old Times,” his various themes of time‐traveling and personal, minute awareness of the instant, and his concepts of emotion remote from circumstances, all here seem to come together in a mature and astonishingly satisfying play. It is a play to wander in, a play to luxuriate in. The Royal Shakespeare Company, with Peter Hall's direction, John Bury's supernaturally accurate settings and lighting and Beatrice Dawson's costumes have made “Old Times” into a very specific theatrical experience. Together with many of my New York colleagues I saw the play in London last season, in the same production but with a totally different Royal Shakespeare cast. Everything is here the same, but perhaps just deepened with a second view. There is nothing like hindsight to improve a play. Mr. Hall's staging, that mysteriously conversational tone and ritual movements, and Mr. Bury's attractively architectural parody of good taste remain, as instinctive and as immediate as ever. But was the glacierlike formality of the final lighting cues—a coda within a play if ever there was one—so effective in London? Probably, but the mind clouds over past perceptions. The cast? The cast in London must have been as good —yes, indeed, and in places better. But nothing could be completely better than Rosemary Harris, blandly selfcontained, secretive in her sexuality, or Mary Ure, more flagrant but no less hidden, enigmatic with a smile as Lisa as Mona's, or Robert Shaw, objectionably affable and fearfully vulnerable with the shrill‐voiced masculinity of a barnyard rooster. A great cast in what I am tempted to think of as a great play.

799-> Christmas Trees Free From Phase 2 Control
The Internal Revenue Service said yesterday that Christmas trees were not subject to any phase of President Nixon's economic program and venders could charge whatever they liked for them. The price freedom applies only to natural trees and not plastic or aluminum ones. Real trees are what the economists call “raw agricultural products,” which have been exempted from price controls. However, if the trees are altered in any way, such as sprayed with fireproofing or painted pink, then they are no longer “raw agricultural products” and go back under the President's economic stabilization program, the I.R.S. said. The I.R.S. invited those who do not understand, or who do understand and do not like it, to call the nearest I.R.S. office.

To the Editor: Your Oct. 7 news story, “Panama Informs U.N. of U.S. Talks,” referred to Panama's action in placing its demand for canal treaty modification before the United Nations as an “unusual procedure.” Another news story, “Panama's Leader Warns on Canal” (Oct. 12), reported on inflamatory antis American mass demonstrations adjacent to the Canal Zone—demonstrations staged by Brig. Gen. Omar Torrijos to intimidate our negotiators and timed to coincide with Panama's attempt to delude the U.N. into considering a false claim, concerning matter solely under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. Panama's charge of U.S. aggression must be emphatically rejected. Panama alone engaged in aggression in 1959 and 1964 by riotous attacks at the Canal Zone—consistently recognized sovereign territory of the United States by all responsible Panamanian governments, ever since the HayBunau Varilla treaty of 1903. These are invulnerable facts—conclusions and opinions such as expressed In your Oct. 19 news story “U.S. Concessions to Panama Seen” to the contrary notwithstanding. Former Treasury Secretary Anderson headed the emissaries appointed by President Johnson in 1967 for Canal treaty revision. Despite chaotic confusion resulting from the preposterous concessions to Panama proposed in the 1967 draft agreements — not approved by either nation — Anderson was reappointed by President Nixon not only as chairman of the AtlanticPacific Interoceanic Canal Study Commission, but also as head of a new treaty negotiating group. The Oct. 7 news story states “The negotiations . . . broke down in 1967 and languished until last June.” True, but for a very good reason—spontaneous massive waves to protest within Congress and among citizens informed of the ominous threat of the planned and totally unnecessary give‐away of our legitimate sovereign rights in Panama, rights always diligently exercised with justice to all nations, with great economic and financial benefit to Panama, and for the defense of the free world. Like the Bourbons, concerning whom Talleyrand said “They have learned nothing and forgotten nothing,” our “negotiators” now recommend more disastrous proposals—proposals which, if adopted, would set the stage for “Suez Canal” type disaster in Panama. Moreover, although unintended, there was a clear invitation to Communist take‐over of the Canal itself implicit in Assistant Secretary of State Charles H. Meyer's recent statement, published on July 23 in the Torrijos‐controlled El Panama America: “If the Communists should cut off Venezuela's oil shipments or if the Santo Domingo incidents should be repeated, the United States would not intervene. There will be no United States intervention in Panama.” Forces which thwarted the planned give‐away in 1967 will be much stronger and more determined than they were at that time and will, it hoped, successfully prevent planned surrender now.

801-> NATIVE ROYALTY VICTOR IN CARTER
Harbor View Farm's Native Royalty, blanked in seven pre vious attempts this season to get into the winners' circle, finally made it at Aqueduct yesterday by winning the $58, 800 Carter Handicap before 43,269 fans. The fast‐moving son of Raise A Native, was clocked in 1:22 4–5 for the seven‐furlong con test staged on a muddy track. Only a neck separated Native Royalty from Locust Hill Farm's favored Tyrant at the wire, but the latter's position as the run ner‐up was only of short dur ation. The stewards' inquiry sign was flashed on the, tote board moments after the race had been completed. And, after a brief view of the motion pic tures by the officials, Tyrant's number was taken down and the horse was placed last in the field of 12. It, was decided that Tyrant, with Bill Hartack up, had in terfered with Herbert Allen's Forum at the half‐mile pole. For those in the crowd who had been viewing the proceed ings with binoculars, the in quiry did not come as a sur prise. Hartack, in contention for the lead front the start, had been seen looking back at Forum at the point of the al leged infraction. As a result, the official order of finish behind Native Royalty was hastily changed. Green tree's Cut the Comedy, who had come home 2½ lengths behind Tyrant, was placed sec ond. Key‐Hill's Shut Eye, who had trailed the Greentree geld ing by a head at the wire, was advanced to the third spot. Although a nonwinner for the season, Native Royalty was the recipient of considerable support from the crowd. Aware that the 4‐year‐old had shown improved form in finishing a close second in an allowance race at the Big A last week, the crowd sent the colt off as the $15.80‐for‐$2 fourth choice. Native Royalty also had one other factor in his favor. He carried 112 pounds as compared to 121 for Tyrant and 126 for Hickory Tree Stable's, Towzie Tyke who finished sixth in the corrected order. With the aid of that light package the colt raced in his best form, He was kept off the early pace by the highly capa ble John Rotz in the run down the backstretch and was sent to the lead nearing the stretch. Hartack, after his close brush with Forum, trailed Na tive Royalty only slightly as the two leaders entered the straightaway. But in the run for the wire, the Harbor View performer outlasted his rival. Particularly delighted with the outcome was Rotz, New York's leading stakes rider in 1970, who was making his de but this season as a stakes win ner in his home state. Said Gentleman John: “My horse had to do his best and he did it. I set him down at the head of the stretch and he gave me a fine run. He had to, for that other horse, Tyrant, I think, gave him a real battle.” Forum, ridden by Johnny Ruane, was the early leader, but he was not allowed to lead by much. Hobeau's Handsome Kid, who also toted 112 pounds, with Braulio Baeza at the helm, took over nearing the far turn. But as the field came round the bend, the duel between Na tive Royalty and Tyrant began to take form. The Harbor View colt took the lead from the outside. Kept on the inside by Hartack after passing in front of For um, the favorite continued on the rail as he fought Native Royalty for the lead. He tried to head the leader approaching the sixteenth pole, but the Har bor View performer was able to stave off the threat. The victory, worth $35.280, increased Native Royalty's 1971 earnings to $55,127, just short of the $56,070 earned by the son of Raise A Native last year. In the contest that preceded the feature, Tartan's favored Lonesome River captured the six‐furlong $15,000 Reality. The victory was in keeping with the theme of the program's earlier five races, which pro duced only short‐priced win ners. The Tartan 5‐year‐old, clocked in 1:10 1–5, returned $4.40 for $2. Kept off the early pace, Lonesome River showed lots of speed in the closing phases to pass C. V. Whitney's leading Prize Silver in the stretch. Then the Tartan performer held off a late rush by Brookmeade's Climber with ease to win by three lengths. The Carter is best remem bered by elder horsemen for the triple dead heat it produced — the only one in American stakes history — in 1944. In volved were Brownie, Wait a Bit and Bossuet. The fixture is named for Captain William Carter, a tugboat captain, who contributed $500 of the $600 purse for the race's first run ning in 1895.

803-> Lower Minimum Age for Congress Urged
WASHINGTON, Nov. 1—Two Democratic members of Con gress proposed today that the age at which young people be come eligible for the Senate and House be lowered by three years, to parallel the drop in the voting age from 21 to 18. Senator Birch Bayh of Indi ana and Representative Robert F. Drinan of Massachusetts in troduced a constitutional amend ment that would permit young people to enter the House at 22 instead of 25 and the Senate at 27 instead of 30. Most proposals to change the Constitution are either ignored by Congress or make long, slow progress toward ratification, but the sponsors of this move expressed confidence that it would win Senate and House approval in a matter of months and possibly be adopted in time for the 1972 election. Senator Bayh noted that the 26th Amendment, which au thorized the 18‐year‐old vote, had required only 100 days to win the necessary approval of three‐quarters of the state leg islatures after it cleared Con gress. The Senator declared, “I be lieve that the incredible speed of this ratification and the en thusiasm with which the pro posed amendment was met in Congress and in the states demonstrates the trust and confi dence Americans across our land have in our younger citi zens.” The amendment is known un officially in Massachusetts as the Kerry Amendment because, if it were adopted early enough in 1972, it would permit John F. Kerry, leader of Vietnam Vet erans against the War, to run against Senator Edward W. Brooke, a Republican. Mr. Kerry will be 28 this Decem ber. In 1970 Mr. Kerry cam paigned for a month in the Third District of Massachu setts, which includes his home in Waltham, but he then with drew in favor of Father Drinan and worked in the victorious campaign of the Jesuit priest. At a news conference today, Father Drinan said he hoped that adoption of the lower Con gressional age levels would “change young people's at titudes and restore their faith in our institutions.” Senator Bayh said that the proposal did not seek compa rable reduction in the Constitu tion's requirement that Presi dential candidates be at least 35 years old because the young est of them to date have been in their early 40's, so “that's not a ?? factor.” Representative Drinan said he had discussed the proposal with Speaker Carl Albert, Demo crat of Oklahoma, and Repre sentative Emanuel Celler, Democrat of Brooklyn, who is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and “I have found no resistance whatsoever.” Father Drinan said there had been “no overwhelming con sensus” when the present minimum ages were adopted at the Constitutional Conven tion in 1787. Virtually all state legislatures have lower age re quirements, he said, with only seven setting their minimums as high as 30 and 25.

General Motors, Ford, Chrys ler and American Motors yes terday reported dealer sales of passenger cars for the latest 10‐ day sales period. G.M.'s passenger car sales jumped to 189,453 in the Oct. 11–20 period from 139,050 in the previous 10‐day period and 56,859 in the 1970 period, when lits operations were strike bound. Ford's car sales shot up to 93,238 from 76,953 in the pre vious 10‐day period and were up 30 per cent from the 71, 466 sold in the Oct. 11–20 period of 1970. Chrysler sales of domesti cally built cars slipped to 43, 469 from 45,561 in the Oct. 11– 20 period last year but topped the 30,163 sold in the first 10 days of this month. Including sales of Chrysler's Colt and Cricket, both made abroad, sales in the period just ended totaled 45,983, which Chrysler counts as the second highest on record for the Oct. 11–20 period. American Motors said its sales rose to 8,130 for the period just ended from 7,976 in the 1970 period, but were down from the 8,579 sold in the first 10 days of this month. The auto industry had nine selling days in the period just ended, compared with eight for the previous period and eight in the Oct. 11–20 period last year. Chrysler said its sales for the first nine months totaled 1,058, 693 cars (including the Cricket and Colt), up 8.3 per cent from the same 1970 period. G.M.'s sales from the start of the year through Oct. 20 totaled 3,665,804, a 21 per cent gain from the 1970 period.

806-> 130 Lawyers Arrive to Observe Mississippi Voting
JACKSON, Miss., Nov. 1— More than 130 out‐of‐state lawyers woke up in mostly poor black homes this morn ing to a state that is in the middle of a bumper harvest and a promising hunting sea son, and is facing what many here are calling “the most im portant election of our times.” Arriving late yesterday, the lawyers—about half of whom, are white—were briefed on state voting laws and, then driven by local people to the homes of black families in the state's 82 counties. Tomorrow, the lawyers will serve as poll watchers when 286 black can didates compete for elective offices in elections that range from local constables to Gov ernor. In many white areas, it is only the newspaper, radio and television advertisements that talk about the upcoming elec tions. But there is a near frenzy of activity in black areas. In Belzoni, a flat, hot Delta town, Benita Bolden, a 20‐year‐ old Howard University zoology major, and six of her classmates conferred on last‐minute de tails today on how to get elderly and ill voters as well as housewives to the polls. Three busloads of Howard students made the 23‐hour trip to Mississippi last week; since then, they have been joined by hundreds of black and white students. Lester Hyman, an aide to Senator Edmund S. Muskie, Democrat of Maine, and Wil liam Weeks, an aide to Repre sentative Paul N. McCloskey Jr., Republican of California, worked in Mississippi's palm tree‐studded Gulf port area of Pass Christian and Biloxi, where the black Mayor of Fayette, Charles Evers, expects his strongest white support in his campaign for the Governor's office. His principal opponent is a white lawyer, William Waller, who is considered a moderate. Mrs. Lizzie Carpenter, former press secretary to Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson, campaigned in Sun flower and Bolivar Counties with Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer, a candidate for the State Sen ate. And Edward Weisl Jr., a former Assistant Attorney Gen eral under President Johnson, flew here today to coordinate any complaints that the black candidates might have. The campaign reminded many observers of the summer of 1964, when the Student Non violent Coordinating Committee and the Congress of Racial Equality brought hundreds of black and white college stu dents, as well as lawyers and celebrities, into the state to help with voter registration and voter education. But Michael D. Shagan, a lawyer, noted a major difference: “Local people are making the decisions now. We are simply supporting them.” Mr. Shagan, who is 30 years old, is the general counsel for the Offtrack Betting Corpora tion in New. York City. He is spending his vacation coordinating the travel and accom modations for the lawyers in the Evers for Governor head quarters in downtown Jackson. Mr. Evers's headquarters is busy from early morning until late at night, but many offices in black communities around the state are no less busy. In Madison County just north of Jackson, Mrs. Flonzie Goodloe joined other blacks in passing out sample paper ballots show ing the names and identifying numbers of the 30 black candi dates for county posts. “And if you have any trou ble,” Mrs. Goodloe tells every one she meets, “you just tell a voting official you want some one to help you and you can choose your official—you can choose someone you know, someone you trust.” Much of the activity in black districts in recent days has cen tered on the methods of cast ing a vote, both by voting ma chines and by paper ballots. The Drummer, a weekly, newspaper published by the Poor Peoples Corporation in Jackson, has issued a special edition dealing with the state election laws, voting machines and paper ballots. One contributor was Emily Paynter, who works for the At lanta‐based Voter Education Project at Tougaloo College. Miss Paynter, who is white and from Boston, has also produced motion pictures and color slide shows—using local people — to teach the basics of voting. Moving quietly through sev eral Delta communities, was John Lewis, director of the voter education project and founder and former head of S.N.C.C. For a brief time today he reminisced about his first trip to Mississippi. “Ten years ago, he said, “I had no idea that in 10 years black people would be challenging just about the entire state.”

807-> Two Gas Explosions Disrupt the Elegant Life on East 57th Street Block
One of the city's more ele gant blocks was jolted and covered with broken glass early yesterday by two un derground explosions of gas ignited by burning electrical cables. Only two persons were in jured, neither of them seriously. The explosions—of a kind that happen in the city every day, although usually on a smaller scale—collapsed windows in 10 of the stores on 57th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues and in all three of the block's apartment‐hotels. Three tons of glass on the street kept the block closed for five hours after the blasts, until 12:15 P.M., causing traffic snarls on Lexington and Park. Electricity was cut off in some buildings and was not restored until 3 P.M. And on a street where foie gras is considered a snack and $5,000 is the price of an antique vase, there were other problems. Grecian urns crumbled and haute cuisine adjourned. Sleep‐in maids re ported for work as usual, but daily help did not. Philip Col leck fell from his four‐poster bed. Mrs. Eleanor Wrench was “scared to death,” and her Pekingese, she said, suffered shock. “It's awful,” moaned Stuart Levin, owner of Le Pavillon restaurant. “Just awful.” It was 9:15 A.M., two hours after the first explosion, and Mr. Levin had just arrived at 111 East 57th St. with a glazier. He peered at the gaps where Pavilion's windows used to be; he stared at the shards of glass on the red carpet. Then he turned away and wrinkled his nose. “Smoke,” he announced. “Smell it. And Random House and Henrl Bendel are supposed to come to lunch.” Now no one could come to lunch or dinner either, he said, because in ad dition to the lack of windows, there was a lack of electricity. “We can't possibly open until tomorrow,” he explained later, “because for tonight, they'd have to be making the sauces now.” While Mr. Levin was worry ing about how to get in touch with Bendel's, Mrs. Erna Soares, housekeeper of the Dorchester at 110 East East 57th, was worrying about how to get the apartment‐hotel cleaned. “The police aren't letting anyone on the street,” she complained, “and none of the maids are in yet.” Con Ed Criticized And Mrs. Wrench, standing in the lobby of the Ritz Tower Hotel at 57th and Park, was be rating the Consolidated Edison Company. “They don't deserve a rate increase,” she said; “they deserve a decrease.” Like many of the residents, Mrs. Wrench chose not to lin ger on the block. “I've got to get my dog to my daughter's,” she explained, tugging at a beige Pekingese. “She's a wreck from the explosion.” There was more criticism of Con Ed along the block, as one shopkeeper after another ar rived to inspect the damage. Some storeowners found, after a glance around their premises, that there was actually little to complain about. Abel Abra hamsen, for instance, owner of Norsk, discovered that although his display window had col lapsed, none of the china on display had been damaged. But other were less lucky. “Nothing is replaceable,” said Mrs. Lee Abel, part‐owner of the Ephron antique and ob jets‐d'art gallery, as she stood before her front window and pointed out her losses. “There's a $6,000 pair of Greek vases, in pieces. There's a turquoise vase, $4,500.” Next door, in a store where bathrooms are designed and sold for several thousand dol lars, the owner, Sherle Wagner, had similar complaints. Mr. Wagner, Mrs. Abel and their colleagues were particu larly bitter that only two months earlier, on Nov. 12, they had had another, though lesser, explosion. Yet Con Ed officials said there was little they could do to prevent such occurrences. Norman Haynes, a company spokesman, said, “Our engi neers are working on it, but there's nothing we can do now.” The explosions, the officials explained, were caused this way: Salt used in snow‐clean ing efforts seeped into the man holes and eroded the electrical cables. The salt acted as a conductor and a fire occurred, burning the insulation on the cables, which emitted gas. The gas accumulated until, ignited by the cable, it exploded. “It happens every day, in some part of the city, in one degree or another,” said Fire Chief George C. Hennessy of the Eighth Battalion. Usually, as in yesterday's event, the Fire Department need not ex tinguish anything; Con Ed cuts off the electricity in the cable and the fire dies of its own accord. Instead, the firemen's role is limited to pushing broken glass out of buildings onto the streets, to be swept away by the sanitationmen.

808-> BALLOTING AT 18 PASSES IN ALBANY; REFERENDUM DUE
ALBANY, Jan. 11—The State Senate and the Assembly gave overwhelming, final legislative approval today to a proposed amendment to the State Consti tution that would lower the vot ing age from 21 to 18 in all state and local elections. The proposal, acted on by both houses on the first work ing day of the 1971 legislative session, now goes to the voters for a referendum decision in November. Because it is a proposed con stitutional amendment, the bill does not require action by Gov ernor Rockefeller. If it is sanc tioned by the voters, some 930,000 young people between the ages of 18 and 21 will be eligible to vote in the 1972 state elections. The United States Supreme Court has already upheld an action by Congress reducing the voting age in Federal elections from 21 to 18. But the nation's highest court also ruled that in dividual states must decide whether to lower the limit for non‐Federal elections. Dual Standards Feared A compelling reason for pas sage today was to try to bring state law into conformity with the new Federal standard, to avoid what many lawmakers consider to be a potentially “catastrophic” dual‐standard voting situation, where those under 21 years old could vote in Federal elections but not in state and local contests. The proposed constitutional amendment was passed by both houses last year. Such amend ments require the consent of two separately elected Legisla tures and then the voters to become effective. The measure passed first yes terday in the Senate by a vote of 51 to 3 after a half hour of debate. It then went before the Assembly for 45 minutes of speeches and passed 137‐8. In the Senate, the list of sponsors of the bill contained only Republicans, a fact that did not escape the notice of the Democratic minority leader, Jo seph Zaretzki of Manhattan, who took the opportunity to is sue the session's first political broadside. Contending that the reduction in voter age was a long‐stand ing Democratic proposal, Mr. Zaretzki said to his Republican colleagues: “I accuse you of legislative larceny.” “It is time we are given at least the credit for ideas we have originated,” Mr. Zaretzki said, urging prompt adoption of the bill “with the clear under standing that this is a Demo cratic bill.” Nonplussed, the Republican majority leader, Earl W. Brydges of Niagara Falls, rose and said: “I could accuse the distinguished minority leader of third‐degree harassment. I don't think the Democrats have any monopoly on progress.” A clause in the bill, carried over from the original 21‐year‐ old voting legislation, drew out cries from three Bronx Demo crats — all of whom represent predominantly Spanish‐speak ing constituencies. The three were Senator Robert Garcia, Assemblyman Manuel Ramos and Assemblyman Armando Montano. The three took exception to a clause that denied the franchise to persons unable “to read and write English.” They were somewhat mollified when told that a recent Supreme Court ruling had struck down such prohibitions. However, the State Constitution requires that a proposed constitutional amendment up for final legis lative approval must he identical in its wording to the bill that achieved first passage. Senator John J. Marchi, Re publican of Staten Island, voted against the bill because, he said, he felt it was “bad public policy, and I feel will be re jected wholeheartedly by the people.” Mr. Marchi said his opposi tion had been triggered pri marily by the fact that reduc tion of the voting age was not accompanied by a reduction of the age of majority from 21 to 18. There are estimates that be tween 1,400 and 1,700 statutes contain clauses establishing the age of majority at 21, and they range from criminal laws that provide child status for the treatment of 18‐year‐old of fenders to prohibitions against the signing of contracts by 18‐year‐olds. Another Senate opponent was Samuel L. Greenberg, Demo crat of Brooklyn, who said he felt that 18‐year‐olds “still do not have the worldly experi ence, maturity and knowledge . . . to cast a vote based on some logic and some reasons.” The third Senate dissenter was Richard E. Schermerhorn, a freshman Republican from Cornwall. Several sources said that while the issue of majority age deserved looking into, it was unlikely that legislative action would be taken until next year, after the referendum on 18‐ year‐old voting has been held. In both houses, supporters of the bill voiced the opinion that it would spur young people, many of whom resist “the sys tem,” to take part in govern ment in constructive, nonviolent ways. In the Assembly, Peter R. Biondo, a Westchester Republi can who sponsored the meas ure, said that the bill would cease to perpetuate “a paradox —one that prohibits our youth form voting for Governor Rockefeller and allows them to vote for the same man should he choose to run for President next year.” The argument was less than persuasive to Assemblyman Edwyn E. Mason, Republican‐ Conservative of Stamford, who said that “most of those in the 18‐and‐19‐year‐old bracket are interested in boys, girls, motor cycles and rock music,” and had “little knowledge of the duties of citizenship.” Other Assemblymen, all Re publicans, who opposed the measure were Rosemary R. Gunning of Queens, Charles A. Jerabek of Suffolk, Emeel S. Betros of Dutchess County, Frank A. Carroll, Monroe County; John T. Flack, Queens; Ronald H. Tills, Erie County, and James T. McFarland of Buffalo.

809-> JARRING CONVEYS ISRAELI PROPOSAL TO EGYPT'S ENVOY
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Jan. 11—Indirect Arab ‐ Israeli peace talks approached the negotiation stage today as Dr. Gunnar V. Jarring, the United Nations intermediary, con veyed to an Egyptian repre sentative the outlines of an Is raeli proposal for a settlement. Dr. Jarring, who returned from Israel yesterday, received Mohammed H. el‐Zayyat, the Permanent Representative of the United Arab Republic. This session, held tonight, followed two meetings between Dr. Jar ring and Secretary General Thant. Dr. Jarring had asked Mr. Zayyat to meet him at an un disclosed place in midtown Manhattan rather than in his office. Neither was available for comment. Muhammad H. el‐Farra, the Representative of Jordan, was due to confer with Dr. Jarring tomorrow. Israeli Talks ‘Useful’ This morning Dr. Jarring au thorized a United Nations spokesman to report that his talks in Israel with Premier Golda Meir and Foreign Minis ter Abba Eban had been “use ful and interesting” and had included matters of substance. He added the hope that the talks would “lead to construc tive results.” The Israeli proposal was un derstood to deal with all the major aspects of a Middle East settlement — agreement on a just and lasting peace, freedom of navigation through interna tional waterways, Arab refu gees, treatment of prisoners of war as well as security and withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied Arab territories. Informed diplomats cau tioned against assuming that the basic Israeli position on these points had softened. But Mrs. Meir and Mr. Eban were understood to have stated that they barred no issue from ne gotiation. A Significant Step The diplomats regarded it as a significant step forward that the Israeli Government, for the first time, had engaged in a substantive discussion on these issues with Dr. Jarring. This, it is felt, effectively dispelled the fears that the Is raeli Government's insistence on a visit by Dr. Jarring to Jerusalem was a stalling ma neuver. These fears had been widely held not only by Arab officials but also by some Western and neutral diplo mats. Until recently, the Israelis had expected the Jarring talks to deal almost exclusively with procedural matters for the next several months. Israel wanted the talks to be held at the level of foreign ministers. It opposed New York as a meet ing place and wanted a site closer to the Middle East. But over the weekend, ac cording to informed sources, the Israeli officials did not in sist on these preliminary de mands. Instead, the sources said, the Israelis plunged into a substantive discussion with Dr. Jarring almost immediately. It was believed also that the talks in Jerusalem had cleared the atmosphere between Dr. Jarring and the Israeli Govern ment. Although he has never publicly expressed his feelings, it is generally known that the United Nations intermediary was angry and suspicious when he left New York last Thursday for Tel Aviv. Not only was he reported to share the wide spread suspicion that the Israeli invitation was a delay ing tactic, but he also was known to have felt embarrassed in his relations with the Arabs by the fact that he felt it necessary to accede to Israeli demands that he visit Jerusalem. President Anwar el‐Sadat and other Egyptian leaders have been saying that they would not be in a position to extend the present cease‐fire beyond its Feb. 5 expiration date unless the Israelis agreed to negotiate in good faith and unless tangible progress to ward a settlement had been achieved. Arab sources speaking on the basis of the first reports on the Israeli initiative said here that Mrs. Meir's willingness to discuss questions of substance with Mr. Jarring was a step in the right direction. Israeli officials are known to feel that their Government has now given proof of its good faith and that the next step is up to the Arabs. Israel has taken the position that the Jarring talks must re main the only framework for negotiation at this time. Egypt and other Arab coun tries have been saying that they would call for a Security Coun cil meeting if there was no progress in the Jarring talks by Feb. 5.

810-> G.O.P. BLOCKS BILL ON CAMPAIGN COST
WASHINGTON, March 23— Republicans moved on several fronts today to counter Demo cratic pressure for speedy ap proval of legislation to limiting spending in political campaigns. Republican Senators used parliamentary maneuver to block a meeting of the Senate Commerce Committee at which Democratic leaders had hoped to report for floor action measure setting ceilings on the contributions a candidate may receive and on his total spend ing for political advertising. Deputy Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst asked the committee to reopen its hearings on the legislation so that the Justice Department could present testimony. He maintained that the Nixon Ad ministration's legal position could not be adequately pre sented to Congress in a letter. Five Republican members of the Commerce Committee, in separate letter, asked that the hearings, which were completed March 5, be resumed so that group of experts on campaign finance could testify on con stitutional questions raised by the legislation. The net effect of the various Republican moves was to delay for at least a month, and pos sibly two, any Senate action on campaign spending legisla tion. Its sponsors say it must be enacted before the end of the year to apply to all Presi dential campaign competition in 1972. Russell Hemenway, national director of the National Com mittee for an Effective Con gress, said the Republican moves were designed “to delay, obfuscate and eventually kill any reform legislation” and ran counter to President Nixon's comments on television last night. In an interview at the White House, Mr. Nixon declared, “We do favor a limitation on expenses. There's no question about that.” He also said that such legis lation should cover all cam paign expenses and not give incumbents an advantage over their opponents. “The President made a posi tive statement,” Mr. Hemenway declared, “and for his lieuten ants to mastermind this behind the‐scenes effort to block the legislation is unbelievable.” Senator John O. Pastore, Rhode Island Democrat who is chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Communica tions, had not yet decided to night whether to reopen the hearings, but the best informa tion was that he would feel compelled to honor the request of the Justice Department. Today's committee meeting was canceled when Senator William B. Saxbe, Ohio Repub lican, objected to its being held while the Senate was meeting. Under the rules, committees may meet when the Senate is in session by unanimous con ent of all members. Mr. Saxbe said later he had acted at the request of the minority floor leader, Senator Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania. Senator Scott is co‐sponsor of a campaign spending bill that does not contain any limits on spending. He says that 80 to 90 per cent of it represents the White House position. When Senator Pastore learned that the meeting had been blocked, he observed: “I know there is a strong feeling on the part of some who would rather have no bill at all.” The five Republican Senators who requested that hearings be reopened—Norris Cotton of New Hampshire, Robert P. Grif fin of Michigan, Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, Marlow W. Cook of Kentucky and Ted Stevens of Alaska—said in their letter that testimony should be taken from such campaign spending experts as Chancellor Alexander Heard of Vanderbilt University, Herbert E. Alexan der of the Citizens Research Foundation and Prof. Ralph K. Winter Jr. of the Yale Law School. Coincidenttally, the American Enterprise Institute made public, a report by Professor Winter in which he opposed any limit on campaign spending or contribu tions and any requirement that candidates make public reports of such figures.

811-> Chotiner Leaving White House to Aid Nixon's 1972 Race
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 — Murray M. Chotiner, one of President Nixon's key political aides, will leave the White House staff soon to begin organizing Mr. Nixon's cam paign for re‐election in 1972. Authoritative White House sources said today that Mr. Chotiner would remain in Wash ington as director of a pri vately funded campaign or ganization. The sources said he would act “under the tute lage” of Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who was Mr. Nixon's campaign manager in 1968. Mr. Chotiner confirmed this afternoon that he was destined for a new assignment, but would not disclose its nature. “I know what my plans are, but I can't say yet,” Mr. Cho tiner said. ‘It's not time to an nounce them.” Neither Mr. Chotiner nor the sources would give a precise date for his departure from the White House. But it ap peared likely to occur soon after the Republican National Committee holds its mid‐winter meetings here this week. As a private citizen, Mr. Chotiner would be free to begin working on the 1972 campaign effort, away from observers of the White House staff. His private role would also bolster an apparent effort by Mr. Nixon to adopt a nonpar tisan stance this year. The White House has been deliber ately playing down politics in recent weeks. “This is a noncampaign year,” the President told tele vision commentators during his “conversation” with them last week, “and now I'm going to wear my hat as President of the United States, and that's where I'll be on this program and on other programs for the balance of '71.” There had been speculation late last year that Mr. Chotiner would be reassigned to a staff post at the Republican National Committee after it had desig nated a new chairman. But Mr. Chotiner said today that he would not work for the National Committee. At first he did not answer the inquiry about a change in duties. Asked if he were going to leave the White House, Mr. Chotiner said, “I leave every day and I come back in the morning.” Then he confirmed that he was going to leave for a period longer than overnight, but de clined to be more specific. The White House sources said that they did not have any indication that the Presi dent intended to reassign his two other staff political opera tives, Harry M. Dent and Charles Colson. Speculation that Attorney General Mitchell would resign sometime this year also arose following the Nov. 3 Congres sional elections—and was denied by the Department of Justice. By assigning Mr. Chotiner to a campaign role, with Mr. Mitchell as a part‐time over seer, it would be possible for the Attorney General to re main in the Cabinet. One source said that Mr. Chotiner would begin with “a small group that will keep ex panding” as the 1972 campaign approaches in earnest. Mr. Mitchell could use it as the nucleus for an official cam paign organization, should he decide late this year to man age another Presidential bid. Mr. Chotiner's political as signment is the first solid indi cation of something few have doubted here, that the Presi dent intended to seek another four‐year term. The White House clearly has had the next Presidential elec tion in mind, however, as Mr. Nixon's legislative plans for 1971 have taken shape. Their focus will be on domestic pro posals, where the White House believes Mr. Nixon must estab lish in the coming months that the Administration is concerned about the well‐being of the American citizen. One source said today that Mr. Nixon would submit his legislative package in hopes that Congress would go along with his major suggestions of Federal revenue‐sharing and welfare reform, both of which are designed to rescue financially strapped cities and states. At the same time, the source said, Mr. Nixon was prepared to take advantage of Congres sional opposition if it should arise. “The Democrats are going to have to hang together on this legislation,” he said. “Either they all pass it—which removes a campaign issue—or they all reject it as bad legislation or insufficient. If they battle over it, they're going to be divided going into a national cam paign.” Mr. Chotiner, who is 61, has been one of the President's closest political allies since 1946, when he handled publicity for Mr. Nixon's first campaign for the House of Representatives. He helped again in a re election contest in 1948 and, two years later, managed Mr. Nixon's successful campaign for the Senate from California. Admirers have called Mr. Chotiner “the perfect political technician.” Enemies have de scribed him as “the complete political hatchet man.” Both sides have regarded him as a controversial figure in Republi can politics. He was rumored as a pos sible Republican National chair man when Mr. Nixon won the Presidential campaign in 1968, but opposition developed to Mr. Chotiner and he remained in the background.

812-> 4 Indicted in Picket Clash at S.I. Paper
Natale Marcone, president of the Italian‐American Civil Rights League, was among four persons indicted yester day on charges stemming from a fracas with the police when the league picketed the offices of The Staten Island Advance last month. Mr. Marcone, Peter Candor ini and Ralph Monda were charged in State Supreme Court on Staten Island with obstructing government ad ministration. The police said the three had prevented a pa trolman from arresting Mr. Candorini's son, Joseph, for criminal trespass during the incident on Feb. 25. Joseph Candorini, the fourth defendant, was charged with felonious assault on the pa trolman, James Howarth. The league demonstrated against The Advance for two weeks to protest a series of articles in the daily newspaper on reputed Mafia figures who make their homes on Staten Island. Among those the articles cited were Paul Castellano and James Failla, alleged captains in the Carlo Gambino family; Salvatore Celembrino, an al leged captain in the Vito Geno vese family, and Gandolfo Sci andra, Charles Panarella, Greg Scarpa, James V. Scianna and Charles De Pierro, alleged “soldiers” in the. Joseph Col ombo Sr. family. Mr. Colombo's son, Anthony, is vice president of the league. During the picketing the league demanded that the Ad vance stop using the terms “Mafia” and “Costa Nostra” in referring to organized crime. It also demanded the dismissal of Everett Harvey, the author of the articles. The Advance has not complied with either demand. According to the police, the fracas on Feb. 25 began when Patrolman Howarth arrested Joseph Candorini, who alleg edly hit him in the driveway of The Advances plant, in the Grasmere section. When Patrolman Howarth tried to take Mr. Candorini into custody, the police said, the three other defendants went to his aid, and while the elder Candorini and Mr. Monda grabbed the policeman's arms, the 57‐year‐old Mr. Marcone pushed him away from his prisoner, enabling him to es cape. Later the league charged that patrolmen had attacked two of its members during the demon stration and had shouted anti Italian remarks at them. The newspaper later ob tained an injunction against the picketing. Mr. Marcone, a retired union official who lives in the Todt Hill section of Staten Island, was among the league officials sued last June by some Manhat tan residents who objected to noise being made when the league picketed the offices of the Federal Bureau of Investiga tion.

815-> MISSISSIPPI BLACKS TO TEST VOTE RULE
JACKSON, Miss., March 23 Negro leaders, contending that white officials are once again trying to disfranchise Negroes in Mississippi, are pteparing to go into Federal court to chal lenge voter re‐registration plans in 24 Misaissippi counties as be ing a ruse to reduce the num ber of Negro voters this year. About 40 per cent of the State's estimated 251,000 regis tered Negro voters would be affected. The state has 82 coun ties, but most of the counties with large Negro registration are those involved. Negro leaders have com plained that it would be too costly, and too time‐consuming to alert Negroes to the need to to re‐register. Many of the state's Negro, voters live in iso lated rtiral communities. Stewart Baird,: a legal advi ser to Charles Evers, the black Mayor of Payette, said that registration would advertely affect Negroes because in many rural areas of the states, Ne groes do riot read newspapers and do not listen to radio news. “;And transportation for many of them would be a large problem,” Mt. Baird said. “And the inertia of many of the older people would be a problem.” Mr. Baird said that suit against the re‐registration plans would be filed within the next week. The state is scheduled to vote for Gover nor and many other offices this year. The plans to require re‐regis tration by voters in four of the 24 counties have been approved by the United States Justice Department. The other plans apparently have not been sub mitted. Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Mississippi and other Southern states must submit proposed changes in voting Iowa to the Justice Department for determination as to whether they are racially motivated. A spokesman for the Justice Department said that in the four counties where re‐registra tion plans have been approved —Copiah, Pearl River, George and Greene—officials have corn tended that the re‐registration was made necessary because of a shuffling of county districts. The five districts in each county were redrawn under the one‐man, one‐vote doctrine, and voting precincts In some stances were split. However, the Justice Depart ment spokesman said, other counties in Mississippi that have changed their county dis tricts have “agreed” to redraw voting precincts “administra tively” and thus avoid voter re‐registration. Mr. Baird said that it was manifest that the “rationale” behind the re‐registration was to reduce the number of Ne groes eligible to vote. Mayor Evers, a long‐time leader in Mississippi's Negro movement, has said that the state's white officials are changing Mississippi's election procedures “because they think some black person is going to win some top office.” In 1968, the latest year in which a statewide survey was made, eligible white voters out numbered eligible Negro voters, 691,000 to 251,000. Negroes, however, held an edge in several counties and cities. The re‐registration moves in Mississippi began last year after the state Legislature cre ated an unusual election sys tem. Under the new state law, primaries are abolished and there are two elections — a “preferential election” in Octo ber and a general election in November. If no candidate for an office receives a majority of the votes in the “preferen tial election” the two top can didates go on the general elec tion ballot. Mayor Evers said that the proposed system, which is also being attacked in Federal courts, would prevent third party candidates from getting on the general election ballots as they can in other states. The Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, Under Law, private organization, is attack ing the law as designed to de prive Negroes, independent voters and poor people of their rights to participate fully in campaigns and elections. A. F. Summer, the Missis sippi Attorney General, said he expected a quick trial for the law. “The court has indicated to us they will give us an ex pedited hearing,” Mr. Summer said. If the new law is approved by'the Federal court, voters in the 24 counties with re registration orders must re register by July 23 to vote in this, fall's elections. Mr. Baird said this would be impossible. For the last two years, May or Evers and Dr. Aaron Henry of Clarksdale have headed the Mississippi Loyalist Democratic party, which has urged many Negroes to run for public office in the state as independents. Mr. Evers was named national committeeman and Dr. Henry was named state chairman by the Democratic Executive Com mittee after the 1968 national conventimin Chicago, but they1 have been unable, to take over control of the state party. Under the new election law, which went, into effect on Jan. 1, any candidate who desires to enter the preferential elec tion with the designation “Dem ocrat” after his name must file through the old segregation oriented Mississippi Demo cratic party. Republicans must file through the Republican party. Candidates who decline to endorse the principles of either party may file as an independ ent with election officials. Although the Justice Depart ment said it had found “some indications” that the new elec tions law was racially biased, it was not disapproved. The Justice Department con sidered the new law for the full 60‐day period allowed un der the Voting Rights Act and then took no action. Assistant Attorney General Jerris Leonard of the Civil Rights Division wrote the Mis sissippi Attorney General, Mr. Summer, that the United States Attorney General, John N. Mitchell, had been “unable to reach the conclusion that the projected effect would be to deprive Negro voters of rights under the Voting Rights Act.” “I want to make clear that no inference of approval or disapproval is to be drawn from the failure of the Attor ney General to object within the statutory period,” Mr. Leonard wrote.

817-> Pamela A. Martens Married to Captain
BLAIRSTOWN, N. J., Oct. 9—The marriage of Miss Pamela Anne Martens, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert R. Martens, to Capt.

818-> Bridge:
The American Contract Bridge League's spring na tionals in Atlanta last week were the second biggest such championships ever held. Dur the 10 days, 9,706 tables were in play, a figure topped only by the spring event in New York in 1968, when there were 13,538 tables. About 25,000 deals were played, and one of the most interesting is shown in the diagram. It was played in the mixed pair championship, and most East players opened the bidding with one dia mond. A few, however, bid one club for no good reason and this had an impact on the opening lead. When South jumped to four hearts, North had to re strain himself from showing his fine spade suit. He re luctantly concluded that his partner's hearts were likely to be even better than his own spades. Influenced by his partner's opening bid, West led the club seven, and the defenders took the first two tricks in that suit. West was in dif ficulty. If he had returned a black card, South would have dis carded two losers on dum my's winners, finessed in diamonds — and gone down. He would have made the nor mal play of the ace and queen of hearts, hoping for a three‐three split, and the defense would have made two trump tricks. With some misgivings, West shifted to the diamond eight, which was covered by the nine, ten and jack. The declarer worked out that the normal play of the ace and queen of hearts at this point was doomed to fail. Even if the suit obligingly divided three‐three, the de fenders could put him back on lead with the third round of trumps. He would then have to lead diamonds from his own hand, with only a faint hope that the king would fall under the ace. South therefore decided to hope for a doubleton heart king on his right. He led the heart ace followed by the deuce, and was rewarded when East won with the king and was end‐played. Whether he returned a club, a diamond or a spade, the contract was home. The actual return was club, and South discarded one diamond loser at once and an other on the spade ace. He continued by ruffing a spade, drawing West's last two trumps and claiming the con tract. South was quietly pleased with himself, but East was irritable in the post‐mortem. “If you had been less clever, and had returned a club or a spade at trick three,” he told his partner, “we would have made two trump tricks and beaten the hand. “ “And if you had been more clever and seen that you were going to be end‐played, “West retorted,” you would have dropped the heart king under the ace. And that would have been that.” “Not so,” South said, coming to East's defense. “I would cash the diamond ace before exiting with the fourth round of trumps. And that really is that.”

819-> Saigon General Says Enemy Has Pulled Back 15,000 Men
DANANG, South Vietnam, Thursday, Sept. 16 (AP)—A South Vietnamese general said here today that half the North Vietnamese forces threatening the northern provinces of South Vietnam had pulled back across the demilitarized zone and the Laotian border. Lieut. Gen. Hoang Xuan Lam, commander of the five prov inces of Military Region I, South Vietnam's northernmost one, attributed the withdrawal of nearly two divisions—ap proximately 15,000 men—to the enemy's apparent shortage of supplies. “Now we are feeling the benefits of the Laotian cam paign,” he said in an interview, referring to the South Viet namese drive against the North Vietnamese supply‐trail net work in February and March. “The floods up North have set them back another six months, maybe a year.” The general said that they can come back anytime.” “But the monsoons begin in two weeks,” he went on. “I do not expect any major fighting until next year in the next dry season.” General Lam said there still were 15,000 to 20,000 North Vietnamese regulars in Quang tri and Thuathien, the two northernmost provinces, just be low the buffer zone, which straddles the border between the two Vietnams. But, he added, they are bro ken up into small units and ap pear to be avoiding contact with large South Vietnamese sweeping operations intended to prevent infiltration into the heavily populated coastal low lands. Vietcong strength In Quang nam, Quangtin and Quang gnai Provinces, General Lam said, remains at the same level as three months ago—about 25,000 Vietcong combat troops and 10,000 in political cadres and guerrilla forces. “But they are no problem,”; General Lam declared, “Our militia forces can handle the VC.” Some 390,000 allied troops, regulars and irregulars, guard Military Region I. General Lam has about 100,000 South Vietna mese regulars on the first line of defense, 207 miles of bor der from the hills below the DMZ to the mountain jungles on the Laotian border. A few American troops still conduct combat patrols in the foothills, but most of the re maining Americans, 70,000 or more, are'in defensive positions around their camps near such population centers as Danang, Quangtri, Phubai and Chulai. In war developments report ed today, South Vietnamese troops uncovered a North Viet namese supply base and muni tions dump a few miles from the Laotian border, both aban doned when the enemy pulled back across the border in re cent days under bombing by United States B‐52's.

820-> OTTO SCHNIEBS, 78, A SKI INSTRUCTOR
SARANAC LAKE, N. Y., Oct. 9 (AP)—Otto Schniebs, a pioneer skiing instructor, died of bone cancer last evening. He was 78 years old, and had been a resident of Lake Placid for nearly 34 years. Otto Schniebs, a native of Germany, came to this country in 1927 and became one of the nation's first teachers in his field as founder of the American Ski School of Boston. He was a skiing coach at Dartmouth College and later at St. Lawrence University. As reecntly as last January, when he had been skiing for 74 years, Mr. Schniebs told Michael Strauss of The New York Times: “I'm amazed at how quickly (most all Americans pick up the sport.” Asked how much longer he intended to ski, he added, “That's easy—until I die.” Mr. Schniebs was director of the first instructors school for the Eastern Ski Association. Recently, he had been operating a ski shop at the Whiteface Mountain Resort in Wilmington, N. Y. Hundreds of ski trails in various parts of the country were laid out by Mr. Schniebs and bear his name. The author of three books on the sport, Mr. Schniebs coached Dartmouth skiing squads to six national titles, In 1936, four of his collegians were selected for the United States Olympic squad. Surviving are his widow, the former Frida Knetel, and two daughters, Ursula and Mrs. vira Padnode, all of Lake Placid.

825-> Britain Considers Credit Reform
LONDON—In Britain the field of personal credit has long been a lawyer's night mare. Well‐meaning Vic torian legislators packed the statute books with controls and safeguards designed to protect the impoverished widow and the gullible gam bler from the excesses of the rapacious moneylender. Unfortunately, they could not foresee how their acts would inhibit the development of the consumer credit in dustry half a century later. Yet, extraordinarily, no at tempt has so far been made to place consumer credit on rational legal footing. The providers of credit have had to adapt to an un real legal environment through such expedients as the hire‐purchase or in stallment — buying contract— a legal fiction if ever there was one. Since such con tracts do not involve a formal loan of money they are not circumscribed by the 19th century moneylenders and bills of sale acts. The case for basic reform has been strong ever since the nineteen‐fifties when the volume of consumer credit began to expand dramati cally. But until 19G8 all that happened was the enactment of two laws framed to pro vide greater protection to in elividuals entering a hire‐pur chase contract. The laws were overdue and valuable. They gave the hirer better cancellation rights, placed restrictions on repossession by the owner (or lender), made the owner liable in certain cases for the quality of the goods and took a small step in the di rection of truth in lending. But they left the fundamental law on credit unchanged. In September, 1968, the British Government estab lished a committee under the chairmanship of Lord Crow ther “to inquire into the pres ent law and practice govern ing the provision of credit to individuals for financing goods and services for per sonal consumption.” The committee's report, was pub lished five months ago. Its recommendations could hardly have been more sweeping. It proposed the abolition of all existing legis lation on the subject and its replacement by two new statutes—a lending and se curity act, applicable to credit transactions generally, and a consumer sale and loan act, covering all the questions of sale, loan and security rele vant to a conswner credit transaction. Such radical conclusions stem from the committee's belief that the present law lacks any functional basis, fails to distinguish consumer from commercial transac tions, artificially separates lending legislation from se curity legislation, is exces sively technical and in gen eral fails to provide “just solutions to common prob lems.” The committee's report em bodies a wealth of specific proposals. Among the most important are the following: ¶A loan would be involved whenever full payment was deferred in a sale or hire purchase contract. ¶n any loari contract the lender would have the right to recover the loan, together with interest and stipulated charges, but no more. ¶The debtor should be treated as the beneficial owner of the goods, subject to the lender's rights as mortgagee, if he has taken a security interest in those goods. The debtor would have the right to any surplus arising on the sale of such a security, but he would also be liable for any deficiency on sale. ¶An efficient register of security interests in goods worth over £300 ($720) would be kept. ¶An individual buying a car subject to a security in terest would acquire a good title. A firm such as an auto dealer would have to search the register to make sure that the car was unencum bered. ¶The loan provisions of the consumer sale and loan act would apply unless the sum involved were more than £2,000 ($4,800) or the inter est charged were no more than 21/2 percentage points above the bank rate. Other wise, all forms of credit, in cluding trading checks and credit cards, would be cov ered. ¶The sale provisions of the act would apply wherever money was advanced by a seller or a “connected lender” such as a hire‐purchase fi nance house working in con junction with an auto dealer and wherever the sum would be repaid in three or more in stallments. Rental agreements would also normally be cov ered. ¶False or misleading ad vertisements of consumer credit facilities would be il legal and rates of interest quoted would have to be true rates. Advertisements of credit facilities “with no credit charge” would be pro hibited. ¶The consumer would be told the cash price of the goods to be bought on credit as the total cost of borrow ing expressed as a true rate of interest per annum. No statutory interest limit would be set, but a true rate of more than 48 per cent would be judged prima fade ex cessive. ¶A “connected lender” would be liable for misrep resentations and defects, but would have a right of Indem nity from the supplier. ¶Where £30 ($72) or more were involved, the pur chaser would have valuable rights of cancellation and could receive rebates for early settlements. A court or der would be required be fore a lender could re possess if a third of the debt had been repaid. ¶A credit commissioner would have wide‐ranging powers, including the licens ing of all providers of credit and the collection of sta tistics. He would be able to make regulations filling in details of the acts and act as an ombudsman in the field of consumer credit. These recommendations must be seen against the background of the commit tee's general conclusion that there are no grounds for viewing the growth of con sumer credit with concern, that it should be allowed the maximum freedom to develop in a competitive environment and that credit users should be treated as adults capable of managing their own fi nancial affairs. However, the committee has recognized the need for more credit ed ucation and more research in to the problems of the few consumers who do get into trouble. Almost all branches of the credit industry have wel comed the proposals in gen eral terms. A few errors of omission have been noted, particularly with respect to leasing, and there are some doubts about the practi cability of introducing a simple truth‐in‐lending pro vision. Some interested parties al so question the extent of powers envisaged for the credit commissioner, but no one appears to have found fault with the basic critique of the committee's report. Universally welcomed is the common‐sense distinction between a sale and a loan of money, something that existing legislation has made impossible. The concept of the “connected lender” is also judged sound, though some lending institutions are nat urally worried about; the potential extent of their li ability. The Government has al ready accepted one of the committee's recommendations and abolished controls of minimum deposit terms and maximum repayment periods. However, substantive legis lation is unlikely until the parliamentary logjam caused by Britain's application to join the Common Market has been resolved. Fortunately, some progress does not depend on legisla tion. Competition, for in stance, should certainly be enhanced once the Bank of England implements its pro posals for changing the basis of lending controls later this year. Enactment of the commit tee's proposals should remove many anomalies, improve con sumer protection and lead to a general increase in efficiency in the credit industry. It will be surprising if most of these proposals do not find their way into the statute books in time. Mr. Morrison covers bank ing Lfor The Times of London.

826-> WORLD OF SEVENTH AVE.
In a world where most everybody lives on the orig inality of a few, it is re freshing to meet those who persist in doing their own thinking and have achieved success by stubbornly adher ing to a basic concept. “I don't hold other people's viewpoints on merchandis ing,” Arthur 3. November, president of Art Shirt Lim ited, Inc., said last week. “Most sportswear makers want to be everything to ev erybody, but we resisted making a lot of different things and stuck to the shirt dress.” Mr. November's persist ence paid off. Since the busi ness was founded in 1964, Art Shirt has built its volume to the range of $10‐million and has become one of the top suppliers in its field. Mr. November's company pioneered in the so‐called shirt shift, a one‐piece gar ment with a top that looks like a shirt and extends into a knee‐length skirt. There was considerable dif ficulty in selling the idea to retailers. He had to fight a traditional policy of not put ting a one‐piece garment more easily described as a dress among sportswear items like blouses, skirts, and separates. Convincing sales manship among a few large retailers led to stocking the display of shirt shifts in sportswear departments in stead of in dress depart ments, where they were vir tually lost. “I knew that I had to get into the big stores because these were retailers who could stock in depth,” he said. “At first, our garments fea tured the button‐down shirt collar, and later we intro duced the Bermuda collar, shaped like a pan. When the button‐down collar lost fa vor, we held to the Bermuda type. We convinced the re tailer that the variations should be in fabric and color, rather than merely in de sign.” Art Shirt differs from other makers in that it takes the risk of preparing its line con siderably in advance of a season, and then producing ample stocks before orders come in. Mr. November felt, how ever, that there was a cer tain stability in the product, and his risk, he said, is not as great as that of manu facturers who have gone into high fashion or into produc tion of “kooky” garments. His operation stressing qual ity first is more on the order of David Crystal, Inc., a suc cessful sportswear company that offers the Lacoste shirt and shirt dress. “To obtain variation, we went into sportswear fabrics like corduroy and denim types,” Mr. November said. “More recently, of course, we have been in knits and this fabric has given the shirt dress a new look. But knitters have got to do something new, if the importance of the cloth is to be maintained. We can't sustain the business with just the crepe stitch or the Lacoste stitch.” Like many other dress manufacturers, Art Shirt got caught in the dress‐length controversy last fall. “I thought I had it figurecl right,” Mr. November said. “My own swing around the country convinced me that the midi length dress was a railure, so we stuck to shorter lengths, but what we hadn't taken into considera tion was that women and girls wouldn't buy short lengths either. They were waiting for seine consensus, and in the meantime they went for pants.” As a result, business for the company softened last fall. This year, there is an other problem, according to Mr. November. Some store managements have put re straints on their buyers and will not permit them to buy in depth. “This is a discouraging fac tor, and one that is bound to hurt business. This is an un fair and unreasonable stand on the part of stores that, in the final analysis, have little regard for the needs of their customers. It is hypocritical in the sense that what they will be offering consumers in the middle of the season are goods from second‐ and third rate sources, because their prime quality sources will not sit still for such conduct. “Unfortunately,” he went on to say, “manufacturers are running scared. There are not enough of us who will stand up to the big re tailers and refuse to be whip sawed.” Mr. November, 43 years old and Brooklyn born, came into the garment industry when he was 15 years old as an after‐school dress sales man, taking a line around to small stores. After graduation from Abraham Lincoln High School he attended the University of Arkansas, Eureka College in Eureka, Ill., and the City College of New York. He worked for several garment concerns before joining the women's division of the Jay son‐Excello Shirt Company. In 1964, he and Sidney L. Schiro, a man with 23 years’ experience in the blouse busi ness, teamed together to form their own organization. Mr. Schiro had a friend in Philadelphia who offered facilities for sampling of a women's shirt line. Their vol ume of samples got so large that the friend chased them off the premises. Fortunately they found a shirt contrac tor in Philadelphia who of fered them his basement for sampling and cutting and up stairs facilities for manufac turing. In its first year in busi ness, the company shipped $500,000 worth of merchan dise, but in 1965, the wo men's shirt business turned soft, and the partners almost went broke. It was then that they decided to go into the knee‐length shirt, and soon afterward they were on their way to success. Mr. Schiro, a Wharton School of Finance graduate, and a concert violinist, takes care of production, which is now centered in Bridgeport, Pa, Mr. November handles sales, administration, design and styling at 1407 Broad way in New York.

827-> An Educational Reversal
Two months ago the State Legislature unanimously passed a bill again extending the life of the city's Interim Board of Education for another year, this time until June 30, 1972. In part, the Legislature's action was motivated by a desire to put off until next year a decision on how a permanent school board should be selected. News Analysis But the unanimous vote also represented, in large measure, an unusual tribute to the Interim board during the current transitional period to decentralized city school operations. In fact, in signing the bill into law, Governor Rockefeller congratulated the five board members on “a fabulous job.” Now the same board, confronted by the most serious financial crisis in the school system's history, is under attack and scrutiny from many sides. Board Under Study Moreover, the Interim city hoard, in ordering systemwide reductions in school staffs and services, has touched off a revolt by the 31 decentralized community school boards, which have announced their refusal to go along with any cuts. Murry Bergtraum, the board's president, and other school officials have vigorously de‘flied that the bored overspent or was guilty of poor management of its pursestrings. They have called for an examination of their public statements and of their testimony at city hearings to prove that as far back as last spring the board had warned that there would be a budget crisis this year unless more school funds were provided. It will probably take many weeks before all the questions that have been recently raised can be answered — including, who, or which official body, might be responsible for the present school predicament. Commissioner Ewald D. Nyquist's inquiry, which should provide some answers, is expected to take about a month. But the school crisis has, for the first time, focused public attention on the behind‐thescenes working and relationships of the four men and one woman who make up the education board. Outward Show of Unanimity During their nearly two years in office, the five members — whose political and education views vary widely — have presented an outward show of unanimity on most issues. When they have differed openly, they have done so without acrimony or public accusaItions. This is a departure from the record of previous city school boards, whose members frelquently aired their differences in public and in sharp personal terms. In fact, some observers have criticized the present board for alleged postponing decisions on difficult issues until there was unanimous agreement among the members. The present budget crisis, however, has produced some signs of internal strain in the relationship between the members, according to the board sources. At least two members of the board are known to feel that they were not made fully aware of the extent of the present crisis by Mr. Bergtraum. Dr. Mary E. Meade, who served in the city system for nearly 50 years as a teacher and administrator and is reIgarded as the most conservative member, said yesterday that she could not recall any extensive board discussions that pointed up the seriousness of the impending fiscal crisis. Another board member, who did not want to be named, said that he was not “as aware as I feel I should have been” of the budget problem. But, he emphasized, “We may be unhappy about some things, but this is not a divided board—no one is trying to undercut, anyone. We're all in this together now.” Bergtraum Cites Talks But Mr. Bergtrautn insists that the board members were kept fully informed of the budget crisis step‐by‐step. He said there were frequent discussions at executive sessions on the extent of the problem and what the board's response should be. Complicating the problem was the fact that Mr. Bergtraum and other board members could not be sure until a few weeks1 ago of the actual extent of the', budget shortage. The school system's top business post had been vacant for a year and al half—it was finally filled last month — and board members and other headquarters officials, are privately distressed about what they consider to be a chaotic situation in the school business and financial operation. One official, in defense of the present board and. Mr. Bergtraum, said that the current members had inherited this situation and had been working to set matters straight. Dr. Meade, in her comments yesterday, also pointed to what many observers have regarded as a weakness of the present board: the tendency of its members to concentrate mainly on areas of concern in which they have a special interest or expertise. Dr. Meade's special interest is the high schools, where she spent most of her school career. Speaking of budget matters, she said, “I didn't interfere. I left it to the people who knew something about that.” Dr, Seymour P. Lachman's special interest is educational affairs and student rights; Joseph Monserrat, the former president, has as his main concern collective bargaining and community relations; and Isaiah E, Robinson Jr., the vice president who is slated to become president in June, has a strong interest in matters of decentralization. President An Accountant The special interest of Mr. Bergtraum; an accountant, is finance. Board members and school authorities have a high regard for his knowledge in this area and do not personally fault him for the system's present fiscal plight. The budget crisis has put the system's new Chancellor, Dr. Harvey B. Scribner, in the middle of a difficult problem not of his making. Although it was the board that gave the orders to cut school staffs to save money, the task of implementing this fell to Dr. Scribner as chief administrator. Regardless of how the present budget problem is resolved — through “new money, a, bookkeeping arrangement or school cuts—one thing seems certain, a Board of Education member said yesterday: “We're going to be taking a lot more interest in everything in the future, especially budget matters. There's going to be much more challenging of assumptions.”

828-> Scholar Disputes Key to Trumbull Oil
Who's the man wearing the hat in “The Declaration of In dependence,” John Trumbull's famous painting of the na tion's founding fathers? Most art scholars have never given the question a second thought, accepting his identity as established in a “key” to the painting pub lished nearly 150 years ago. Now Irma B. Jaffe, associate professor of art history at Fordham University, has come up with a new idenity for him, and several others in the crowded canvas, tradi tionally dated between 1786 and 1797. In the current issue of The American Art Journal, a scholarly publication issued twice a year by the Kennedy Galleries here, she disputes the identity of the hatted man as Stephen Hopkins, co lonial Governor of Rhode Is land, and suggests that he is really John Dickinson, a Quaker Congressman from Pennsylvania, who refused to sign the Declaration on the grounds that it would lead to war. The hatted man occupies position No. 23 in the key, an outline of the painting with the 48 figures in it cued by number to names underneath. The key has been associated with the painting since it was engraved by Asher B. Durand between 1820 and 1823. No. 23 is currently identi fied as Stephen Hopkins but, playing a complicated game of musical chairs, Professor Jaffe contends that the real Stephen Hopkins occupies position No. 8 in the paint ing. Thus, he unseats Gov. George Clinton of New York, who is really the man in posi tion No. 45, misidentified as John Dickinson. Professor Jaffe's findings are based on her examination last year of a group of Trum bull drawings given to Ford ham in 1943, specifically, a drawing of Stephen Hopkins dated 1791. “I looked at our drawing and then at the painting. The faces didn't match,' she recalls. “So took a magnifying glass to a photo of the work, and saw that No. 8 was our Hopkins.” “The problem then,” she continued, “was to find out what to do with Governor Clinton—identified as No. 8 —and even more intriguing, who was the man in the hat labeled by the key as Hop kins?” Reasoning that the hatted citizen had to be a devout Quaker, who would keep his head covered on such an occasion by reason of his be liefs, Professor Jaffe consid ered the four Quakers who were members of the Conti nental Congress at the time Independence was voted— Hopkins, Joseph Hewes, Charles Humphreys, who does not appear in the painting, and John Dickinson. Dismissing the others on various grounds, she arrived at Dickinson who, though he had played a leading role in formulating Congressional policy against British op pression, was convinced that the Declaration was prema ture and would lead to war. “As a Quaker, a pacifist, man of uncompromising char actor, he refused to sign,” writes Professor Jaffe. ‘He risked and lost his public career by his negative vote.” Her identification of No. 23 as Dickinson is based not only on his lifelong devotion to Quaker beliefs, but also on two portraits of him by Charles Willson Peale, done in 1770 and 1782‐83, that re seinble the face of the hat wearing figure more than they do any other in the painting. And she establishes the identity of No. 45 as Gov ernor Clinton through “the long bony nose and deep set eyes” in a Trumbull por trait of the New York Gov ernor, who became a Vice President, done in 1791, that bears a close resemblance to the face of the Declaration figure. At the Yale University Art Gallery. which owns the largest body of Trumbull works, including the original “Declaration” painting, Pro fessor Theodore E. Steb bins Jr., curator of American painting and sculpture, said yesterday that “like any new contribution, Professor Jaffe's findings will have to be au thenticated over time by other scholars. But the ‘Dec laration’ key hai always been taken for granted,” he added. “and it's very helpful to have someone re‐examine it.” “The whole discovery rests on the small pencil drawing of Hopkins in Fordham's col lection that no one ever bothered to look at before,” Professor Jaffe said yester day. “The images of Hopkins are all taken from that ‘Dec laration’ painting. It amuses me that in the musical, ‘1776,’ he tramps around the stage wearing a hat.”

831-> Panel Challenges U.S. College System
WASHINGTON, March 8—A study group report initiated and endorsed by top officials in the Nixon Administration challenged today the traditional institutions of higher education and called for an “intensive national effort” to develop an alternative system. The group attacked the “conventional wisdom” about who should go to college, when they should go, what kind of college they should attend and who their instructors should be. In an 18‐month investigation, the group found that colleges were not meeting the needs of most of their students. A majority of students who enter college each year drop out before they graduate, the group said, and added that a large percentage of those who stayed in school did so only because college was the socially acceptable pursuit for persons their age. The panel suggested that students go to college at the age when it would most benefit them, not automatically at age 17 or 18. It recommended that new forms of off‐campus education be developed, and that academic credit and even degrees be granted for experiences outside the classroom. Views on Faculty Sources Faculty members, the group said, should be drawn not only from those who have spent their live in academic pursuit but also from persons with wide experience in society. The group, consisting primarily of little‐known academicians and college administrators, was formed in the fall of 1969 at the suggestion of Robert H. Finch, who was then Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. Officials in the department said today that Mr. Finch had wanted a “fresh look” at higher education, and he persuaded Frank Newman, the associate director of university relations at Stanford, to set up a panel. Mr. Newman, a former executive in an electronics company and an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congress in 1966, is a friend of Mr. Finch's. The panel accepted no Federal funds and operated on $35,000 grant from the Ford Foundation. Mr. Newman said that he wanted his panel to maintain its independence from the Government and to “be free to say what we wanted to.” ‘A Significant Statement’ In a foreword to the 140page report, which was released today, the present H.E.W. Secretary, Elliot L. Richardson, said that he and the Commissioner of Education, Dr. Sidney P. Marland Jr., had found the report “as significant a statement on higher education as we have ever seen.” At a news briefing this morning, Mr. Richardson said that he had decided to write the foreword and to distribute the report through his department so it would receive “maximum possible discussion.” Although there have been a number of reports on higher education in recent years, including those of the Carnegie Commission and the President's Commission on Campus Unrest, this is the first to be specifically endorsed by Mr. Richardson and other high officials in the Administration. Education officials acknowledged that it was easier for Mr. Richardson to endorse this report than the others because the Newman group advocated few specific initiatives or expenditures by the Government. In fact, the report contained few specific recommendations at all, and it took no account of the cost of its suggestions, Before pleading for more money, the report said, “The academic community must assess how effectively available’ resources are utilized.” Despite the lack of specific proposals, several educators and education experts who were interviewed today said that they believed the report might have considerable impact. “If the report gets the people at H.E.W. to thinking, and if it encourages them to exercise some leadership toward change, then it could be terribly important,” one educator said. Other Methods Suggested The significance of the report, the educators said, is that it challenges the assumptions off which traditional higher education is based. For instance, the group noted that at nearly all schools, from the most prestigious state and private universities to the smallest community colleges, students were expected to learn from reading assignments, attending classes, listening to lectures and taking examinations. Perhaps, the report suggested, there are other ways to teach that would benefit students who are not attracted by the present method. The report proposed that equivalency examinations be developed to enable individuals to receive credit for knowledge acquired outside classrooms. It urged that educational television be greatly expanded to teach persons who do not want to attend classes. It also suggested the development of informal tutors from whom persons could obtain academic assistance. The Newman group questioned why for the most part only persons in their late teens and early twenties attended college, regardless of whether this was the time in their lives when they could most benefit from it. It contended that colleges were a principal cause of the “generation gap” and suggested that colleges and universities encourage and recruit older students. Both students and faculty members, the report said, live in an isolated community that bears little resemblance to the real world. It doubted whether education could be made more relevant to students and society simply by developing new curriculums because, it said, too few students and faculty members have enough experience outside the education system to know what is televant. Mr. Newman said that he did not want “big names” on his study group and had sought persons who would “think about conventional problems in unconventional ways.” In addition to Mr. Newman, the members of the panel were: William Cannon, vice president of the University of Chicago. Stanley Cavell, professor of philosophy at Harvard University. Audrey L. Cohen, president of the College for Human Services in New York. Russell Edgerton, special assistant to Secretary Richardson. Martin Kramer, a higher education specialist in H.E.W. Joseph Rhodes, a junior fellow at Harvard who also serves on the President's Commis sion on Campus Unrest. Robert Singleton, the former director of black studies at the University of California at Los Angeles who is now on the faculty of the U.C.L.A. business school.

835-> A Footnote: Kaiser's Plan to Invade U.S.
STONY BROOK, L.I.Ⅱ April 23 — A candidate for a Ph.D. in history says he has un covered evidence for the first time that Germany had formal plan to attack and in vade the United States at least 14 years before the United States entered World War I, in 1917. The plan was called Oper ation Plan III and, according to Holger H. Herwig, now completing his doctoral thesis at the State University here, it had for a time the full backing of both Kaiser Wil helm II and the German mil itary establishment. Basically, Mr. Herwig said in an interview today, Oper ation Plan III involved send ing the German fleet into the Caribbean. From the area of Puerto Rico, the fleet was to have been in a position to attack various targets on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. Among the suggested tar gets were New York, Boston and Norfolk, Va., and one early suggestion had the fleet steaming into New York Har bor to bombard the city while another force attacked east ern Long Island. In the years following World War I, the Kaiser denied there had ever been any plan of military or naval action against the United States. “The Kaiser's memory had obviously faded,” said Mr. Herwig. He documented the begin ning of planning as the winter of 1898, when an ambitious young naval lieutenant named Eberhard von Mantey decided to formulate a theoretical war plan against the United States. Within two years, the Ger man Admiralty was at work on the project and on Nov. 27, 1903, it was officially called Operation Plan III. The plan was dropped three years later because Germany concluded that the next war would be fought on two fronts and that it could not spare the men and materiel to attack the United, States. Mr. Herwig said he acciden tally found evidence of the in vasion plans a year ago while conducting research in the Ger man military archives at Frei burg, in West Germany. At the time, Mr. Herwig was doing, general research on his special ty, Wilhelmian Germany. The evidence was contained in 1,500 handwritten pages that were enclosed in five fold ers. The folders were inside cases and had never been in dexed or filed. To find them, Mr. Herwig estimates he read through 50,000 pages of infor mation, all of it in pen and much of it very hard to read. Mr. Herwig, a Canadian, is of German ancestry and reads the language with ease. He is 29 years old and earned a bach elor's degree in history at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and a master's at Stony Brook. The invasion plans clearly outline the intentions, and frequently are done in the handwriting of Germany's top military leaders in the years leading up to World War I. Key Contributors There are letters from Rear Adm. Alfred von Tirpitz, prob ably the most important force in mobilizing support for the war; Vice Adm. Otto von Dede richs, who at the turn of the century was chief of the Ad miralty staff: Count Alfred von Schlieffen, chief of the Army general staff, whose plan for invading Belgium in 1914 drew Britain and Russia into the war, and even a young major named Erich Ludendorff, who went on to become chief of staff from 1916 to 1918 and who was probably the single most pow erful man in Germany during the Mr. Herwig's statement that this was the first evidence of its kind was not immediately challenged. Barbara W. Tuchman, who wrote “The Zimmermann Tele gram” and “The Guns of Au gust,” and Prof. Gordon Craig of Stanford University, another, authority on this period, said in telephone interviews that they had never heard of such plans. The earliest invasion plans found—those of Lieutenant von Mantey—were apparently the result of his being assigned to do a “winter study.” These were projects designed to as sess the planning capabilities of German officers. ‘The Heart of America’ The lieutenant, who later be came a prominent naval his torian, developed several ideas. First, he recommended naval assault on the United States somewhere between Portland, Me., and Norfolk. “Here is the heart of Amer ica and here the United States can be attacked and forced into peace the easiest,” he wrote He suggested a joint naval military occupation of Norfolk, Hampton Roads and Newport News, to be followed up by operations on the Chesapeake Bay in the direction of Wash ington and Baltimore. He had a low opinion of the! United States Navy, Mr. Her wig said, adding that the lieu tenant had written: “It is very detrimental for the Navy of the United States that every citizen is allowed a say and that in case his opin ion is rejected he can ruthlessly, raise the greatest noise in the press.” As for the United States Army, he felt that it offered its men good food and good housing but almost nothing to do. “The result,” he said, “is very slack discipline, ridiculous exercises and many desertions.” The lieutenant's opinion of American fighting potential led him initially to minimize the need for infantry. He formulat ed one plan in which a German fleet would be divided into two attack forces, one at the end of Long Island, the other steaming into New York harbor and bombing the city as well as Fort Tompkins and Fort Hamilton. He further reasoned that if the attack failed, the force could withdraw and occupy Block Island, because it afforded good telegraph communica tions with Germany. In any case, he figured that the occu pation of New York would not have to last more than two or three weeks before America asked for peace terms. The lieutenant submitted his plans to Vice Adm. August Thomsen, chief of the First Battle Squadron, and soon the invasion plans were not just the dream of an eager young, officer but a bonafide project, that the Admiralty pushed. The lieutenant's original plans for an outright invasion of New York were put aside. Admiral Thomson was not so sure he could rely on the element of surprise. Admiral Thomsen considered attacking Puerto Rico, which he thought would offer little re‐, sistance, and from there carry’ the attack to the mainland of the United States. He also rec ommended confining the attack to the East Coast. Of America's vastness he wrote: “I don't even know its size.” Ultimately, the plans were refined until the Admiralty de cided that the United States should best be attacked by sending ships from Germany first to the Azores, where they would stop for coal, then onto either Puerto Rico or Culebra, an island off Puerto Rico. ‘Merciless Attack’ On Jan. 26, 1900, the Ger man naval attache in Washing ton submitted a report to Ad miral Tirpitz in which he sug gested not attacking Washing ton, since there was no indus try of any importance there. He called for a “ruthless and merciless attack against the trade and industrial centers of the Northeast.” During this time, Admiral Tirpitz was playing a major role in building up the German fleet. The Kaiser was apparently enthusiastic about the possibili ty of an attack. As Mrs. Tuch man noted in “The Guns of August,” the Kaiser complained to the King of Italy: “All the long years of my reign my col leagues, the monarchs of Eu rope, have paid no attention to what I have to say. Soon, with my great navy to endorse my words, they will be more re spectful.” But the Kaiser, who reigned from 1890 to 1918, did not want to rely on the navy alone and made the project a joint army navy venture, which is how both Schlieffen and Ludendorff came to work on it. At one point, the Germans considered invading Cuba but abandoned it, because they felt the Cubans would be hostile to them and friendly to the Ameri cans. As early as 1901, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge wrote to President Theodore Roosevelt saying he felt a German landing around Boston—the heart of his constituency—was a possi bility because “the German Em peror has moments when he is wild enough to do anything.” The President agreed on the menace Germany posed, al though it was not until 1913, that the United States actually drew up an official war plan against Germany. In the interim, the Germans collected informa tion on Long Island and, ac cording to Mr. Herwig's re search, Admiral Dederichs was especially Interested in Great Gull, Gardiners, Fishers and Plum Islands, which are off eastern Long Island. He also considered mounting a land at tack in Brooklyn. Was Loyalty Skin Deep? By 1903, American naval in telligence officers were so worried about rumors of a Ger man attack that one of them, Capt. C. D. Sigsbee, renom mended a survey to discover which American sailors with German names were native born and whether any had tat toos that would indicate loyalty to Germany. But the plan, which Germany was ready to implement by the winter of 1904–05, was dropped, The French and English be came more cordial, Italy's op position to German expansion became clear and only Austria Hungary remained solidly with the Germans. The German mili tary establishment thus did not feel strong enough to attack the United States. The advance formulation of contingency plans for invasions is a standard procedure of ma jor military staffs. These plans, which rarely see the light of day, detail potential deploy ment of forces and supply needs for a broad variety of contrived military emergen cies. In a paper based on his re search, Mr. Herwig wrote of the dangers inherent in draw ing up plans of aggression. “We are left once again with Bismarck's warning that by painting the devil on the wall, one makes him at last appear.”

836-> Egypt's Press and TV Berated For Too Much Attention to U.S.
CAIRO, April 23 — Com plaining that Egyptians were being subjected to “brainwash ing” by American influences, a Cairo newspaper has berated the Egyptian press, radio and television for devoting too much space and time to “im portant or trivial, serious or ridiculous events taking place in America.” In an article headlined “Prep aration for War and American Propaganda,” the newspaper, Al Gomhuriya, also protested that too many American films were being shown to Egyptian audiences. “The basic principle in pre paring the people for war is to rid ourselves of the enemy's direct and indirect propaganda, which we still allow to infil trate and fuse with the dreams and aspirations of our youth,” the paper said. “We must care fully study and sift all the shades of culture and informa tion that we offer to the citi zens.” Al Gomhuriya is the official organ of the Arab Socialist Un ion, Egypt's only official politi cal organization. Despite political tensions stirred by United States sup port of Israel, American films and television programs re main popular with most Egyp tians. Even a high information official has gained a reputation for ducking out of early‐eve ning receptions to get home in time to watch “Peyton Place.” Also, the gore and glitter of life in the United States are given prominent display in most Cairo papers as a means of building circulation. To bolster its warning about brainwashing, Al Gomhuriya complained that Egyptian read ers in recent days had been offered exciting news about a huge fire in Florida, a gorilla struck by smallpox in a Ne braska zoo and the adventures of Mrs. Aristotle S. Onassis. In the same edition, how ever, Al Gomhuriya diverted its readers with a photograph of Lcretta Young and the news that the American movie ac tress had decided to sell her home and jewelry and give the proceeds to help retarded chil dren. Al Gomhuriya also carried dispatches about an exodus of American business corpora tions from New York City and another about the drug prob lem among United States sol diers in Vietnam. In its criticism of brainwash ing, the paper singled out for attack the film “Tora! Tora! Tora!” and termed it a master piece of American propaganda “since it pretends to give the point of view of the Japanese enemy.” On page two, nonetheless, the newspaper carries adver tising for “Tora! Tora! Tora,” which has been one of the more successful films shown here in many months. Denouncing the American “propaganda presence” in Egypt, Al Gomhuriya pro claimed: “Anyone with an elementary grasp of psychology knows that the Arab conscience is often disgusted by these strange phenomena, especially as we prepare to confront American napalm, American conspiracies for intervention, and at a time when the American Sixth Fleet opposite our shores has been reinforced by two aircraft car riers, eight destroyers and four submarines.”

837-> Abrams and Sutton Warn Of Fight on Transit Bonds
The Borough Presidents of Manhattan and the Bronx said yesterday that they would fight Governor Rockefeller's proposed $2.5‐billion transportation bond issue unless they were guaranteed that the 30‐cent subway fare would be maintained. Borough President Robert Abrams of the Bronx said he was prepared to do “some dramatic things” next week to emphasize his opposition to the bond issue and a spokesman for Borough President Percy E. Sutton of Manhattan said Mr. Sutton totally endorsed the Abrams position. Mr. Abrams said he was particularly incensed by the Governor's Statement Tuesday that as much as $380‐million of the proposed bond issue would be used to offset fare increases in both the city and the suburbs. Where Funds Would Go The’ Governor said this money would be used for “capital maintenance” projects now paid for out of current revenues. Mr. Abrams insisted that all the money in the bond issue be used for capital expenditures and that funds be found elsewhere to keep the 30‐cent fare. “The subway system is dying, decaying,” Mr. Abrams said, “and we don't want to see one penny of the bond issue used for operating expenses.” The fact that the bond issue was vulnerable was “a stark political reality,” Mr. Abrams said, “and we ought to use the political leverage we have to force some major concession on the fare question.” The spokesman for Mr. Sutton said that although the Manhattan Borough President had made “no formal decision” on the bond issue, “we are lining up with Bob Abrams — we're working with him all the way.” Of the other Borough Presidents reached last night, Sebastian Leone of Brooklyn said that while he favored the bond issue “in concept,” it would never pass in his borough. And Robert T. Connor of Richmond, according to an aide, endorsed the issue because one of the projects it would underwrite was the modernization of the Staten Island Rapid Transit system. Donald R. Manes, who was sworn in yesterday as Borough President of Queens, was unavailable for comment. View in Brooklyn A spokesman for Mr. Leone, in Brooklyn, said the bond issue would never pass in that borough because “there is nothing in it for Brooklyn.” The aide explained that bond issue funds would be used to relocate and extend the 14th Street‐Canarsie Line, “a project people don't want.” This, plus the possibility of increased subway fares, increased tunnel tolls and new bridge tolls on East River crossings, “guaranteed the defeat of the bond issue in Brooklyn,” he said. Earlier in the day, Mr. Rockefeller took his campaign for the bond issue to New City, in Rockland County, where he told an audience that its passage would provide 1,500 more jobs annually in the county. The bond issue, which would provide $1.35‐billion for mass transportation and $1.15‐billion for highways, “is a tremendously important thing for the future of our state,” the Governor said. He said passage of the measure—it goes before the voters in November —would mean a $26.7‐million investment by the state in Rockland County alone.

838-> BOSTON RECEIVES LINDSAY WARMLY
BOSTON, Sept. 22—Mayor Lindsay of New York was introduced to a group of business and civic leaders here tonight as “our charismatic leader” by Mayor Kevin White of Boston. According to guests who attended a reception at the 40thfloor offices of the Boston Company an investment concern, Mr. Lindsay was the star attraction. Mayor White's introduction of his New York counterpart—and now his fellow Democrat—was effusive, they said. Tomorrow a legislative action committee of the United States Conference of Mayors, which Mr. Lindsay heads, will conduct a public tour of taxexempt properties here. Once again it appeared that Mr. Lindsay's professed role as a traveling mayoral lobbyist had merged effectively with his undeclared role as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President. As chairman of the mayors’ group, Mr. Lindsay led a oneand‐a‐half‐day tour here that will enable him and his fellow mayors to call for a better tax arrangement with the Federal Government. As a newly proclaimed Democrat, he helped focus some attention on Boston's Mayor, who is in a runoff for re‐election against Mrs. Louise Day Hicks. Mrs. Hicks won political renown as an opponent of school busing. Mr. Lindsay took a few minutes out at the reception, guests reported to confer quietly with Robert Q. Crane, the Massachusets Democratic chairman. For Mr. Lindsay, the trip represented a brief resumption of the traveling that recently has been taking him away from New York more and more as political attention has focused on him. Next week he has scheduled a three‐day swing to Phoenix, Los Angeles and San Francisco. After tonight's reception here, Mayor White told of how other mayors had been suspicious, in the first days of the legislative ocnference, that they might be merely providing a backdrop for Mr. Lindsay's political performance. “But all that dissipated,” he said as the other mayors found IMr. Lindsay to be a self‐effacing leader of their group. A member of the Boston Mayor's staff said, though, that the socially and financially prominent Bostonians who made up the cocktail crowd had been attracted by two names on the invitation—Mayor Lindsay and Mayor Carl Stokes of Cleveland.

839-> Treasury, Reducing Tax, Allows Fast Depreciation
WASHINGTON, June 22— The Treasury announced today that despite widespread crit icism, it was putting into effect a multibillion‐dollar tax re duction for business by liberal izing the deductions that may be taken for depreciation of equipment. In addition the Treasury also announced that it is laying the groundwork for further liberal izations on a regular biennial or triennial basis assuming that business continues to replace old equipment at an ever accelerating pace. The new depreciation system that is to take effect at once retroactive to the first of this year will be different in a few particulars front the one origi naly announced in January. But its central feature—which per mits business to depreciate equipment as much as 20 per cent faster than under the old rules—is unchanged. Spokesmen for Common Cause a public‐interest lobby headed by John W. Gardner, and for Public Interest Re search Group a public‐interest law firm sponsored by Ralph Nader, said that they would have to read the Treasury's entire announcement before de ciding whether to file suit in an attempt to block the actual adoption of the new deprecia tion rules. These two organizations plus a large number of Democratic Congressmen academic law yers and economists have ques tioned the Administration's authority to put the liberalization into effect without legisla tion. The liberalization would save businesses an estimated $3‐ billion in taxes in its first full year of operation Treasury officials said. For the first 10 years the savings are estimated to average $3.9‐billion annually. Public utilities will be permit ted to use the liberalized rules, subject to some special require ments. But the liberalized standards will not for the mo ment at least be applicable to equipment that is used pri marily outside the United States. These were two issues that were left open in the earlier announcement. The final Version of the new rules also contains a new sys tem for calculating deductions for maintenance and repair of equipment, which Treasury of ficials said was less generous than their earlier proposal though more generous than existing rules. The biggest change since the original January proposal was however the announcement of the creation of a new office In the Internal Revenue Service that will collect data on a Continuous basis, concerning the actual practices followed by business in the retirement and replacement of equipment. This information, which is not available to the Govern ment now would be used as the basis for subsequent revi sions of depreciation rules. John S. Nolan, Deputy As sistant Secretary of the Treas ury said that future revisions of the rules concerning the time periods over which equip ment can be depreciated would Still embody the same sort of flexibility as the present new rules. These rules provide for the use of depreciation sched ules as much as 20 per cent longer or 20 per cent shorter than the prescribed ones. While noting that the 20 per cent figure itself is subject to Change in the future, Mr. Nolan said that the concept of a range of acceptable time pe riods for depreciation had been Permanently adopted.

841-> Bad Day At Cairo, Ill
HE gospel singers huddled be neath a huge poster of a re volver resting on a Bible. Then they glided apart, bobbing and weav ing in their miniskirts and boots, the organ wailing high and moaning low, the faithful In St. Colomba's Church clapping their hands to the driving, syncopated beat. Jesus will be waiting He's going to take me across Because I got one more river To cross, to cross, to cross. Before the last chord had died, the Rev. Charles Koen, leader of Cairo's black United Front, took his stance at center stage. His Afro out lined like a warrior's helmet against the blue‐green of the stained‐glass window, he thanked the sisters for their song, which he said was “all too appropriate” for that day. “The essence of our struggle to day is that we got one more river to cross,” he said softly. “We crossed the Nile. We crossed the Mississippi. We crossed the mighty Ohio. But the river we're going to cross downtown today isn't a phys ical river. It's a river of the spirit. “On the other bank I can see brother Nat Turner. I can see broth er Malcolm X. I can see brother Mar tin Luther King. But they can't bring us across. Only faith will bring us across,” he said, his voice louder now, hammering home the rhythmic phrases, an amulet in the shape of clenched fist swaying from his neck. “It may be kind of tough to cross this river. You might see some brothers fall, going across. But no matter how many folks they kill, no matter how many armored cars they bring in, we got to have faith. We're going to show them down there today. We're going to show them we'll picket downtown as long as there is a downtown.” Then he motioned for the crowd to gather around and the faithful surged forward, covering the plat form, clogging the narrow aisle, heads bent forward toward the min ister as he prayed beneath a banner reading “Before I'll Be a Slave I'll Be Buried in My Grave.” On the sidewalk outside, the crowd spun off into tight little knots to discuss the decision Koen had just metaphorically announced: to defy a new city ordinance which virtually banned picketing downtown. The Front had been picketing downtown businesses for 21 months as part of its boycott to protest the merchants discrimination in hiring. When it promptly challenged the new law in Federal court, it was assured by the city attorney that the police would not try to enforce the regulations until the court ruled. But nobody at the church could be sure what the picketers might face downtown that afternoon. Cairo's retail merchants were pushing a new “tough line” toward the Front. Seriously hurt by the boycott, they had sought the ordinance so they could recoup at least some of their losses during the Christmas shopping season. There were rumors that if the police didn't enforce the ordinance some of the town's “white vigilantes” might take the matter into their own hands. UST before 3:30 P.M., about two dozen pickets climbed into cars for the three‐minute ride across town to Cairo's main shopping street, Com mercial Avenue. The avenue was festooned for the holidays: gold and silver tinsel dangling on cables strung from the rooftops of the two‐ and three‐story loft buildings; artificial snow frosting the corners of the plate glass windows; parking meters wound with red and white paper and topped with big red bows like giant candy canes. The picketers hoisted placards— “No Jobs No $$$,” “Your Guns Pro duce No $$$,” “The Boycott Is Not Over; Meet Our Demands”—and be gan marching single‐file down the avenue's west sidewalk. As they came abreast of the fire station at Ninth Street they could see what awaited them. Both sidewalks from there south bristled with Cairo policemen and special Alexander County sher iff's deputies—some of them known white vigilantes—armed with auto matic carbines, submachine guns, “grease guns,” shotguns and over sized riot sticks. As one picket line approached Eighth Street, several policemen ex changed heated words with Herman Whitfield, a husky picketer who was out on bail after being charged with aggravated battery in the beating of a white man and conspiracy to mur der another. Within seconds, the po lice were struggling with Whitfield and—according to some eyewitnesses —beating him around the head with clubs. A policeman fired a shot in the air. Having driven from the church and parked my car on a side street, I was walking toward Commercial Avenue when I heard the shot. Running to the corner, I saw four or five police men drag Whitfield toward an un marked police car. Two of them heaved him with great force against the car's side, then pulled him back a few feet and heaved him at the car again. Whitfield, his arms pinioned behind him, smiled and said, “That's hip, man, that's real hip.” Just then, the United Front's white van, emblazoned with pink and green flowers and slogans like “Christ Is Love” and “Black Is Beautiful,” sliced into the intersection. The driver, a Front activist named Switch Wilson, took one look at what was happening and tried to swerve out again, but half a dozen policemen and deputies surrounded the van, weapons at the ready. One deputy pointed a shotgun at Wilson in the driver's seat and ordered him out. Wilson reached for the door, but another officer ripped it open and whipped his club down on Wilson's left arm. At that, the deputy in front of the van fired his shotgun in the air. Other shots rang out from behind the Security National Bank, in the direction of the Ohio River levee. Policemen and deputies, crouching, scuttled across the street into the bank's parking lot, scanning the levee, raising their rifles to fire. Later, we learned that a deputy, Lloyd Bosecker, armed but not in uniform, had been shot in the groin during the volley of shots behind the bank. Four young blacks were arrested and charged with attempted murder or conspiracy to commit murder. As shots spattered in the alley, Koen continued to lead a dozen pickets up and down the west side walk under the glowering eyes of merchants clustered behind their plate ‐ glass windows. “Gunfire ain't never going to stop us,” Koen mut tered as he reached the corner and spotted the Rev. Larry Potts, one of Cairo's most militant whites, leaning against a building. “You preach about that tomorrow, Potts,” he shouted. Potts glared back icily. In front of Walder's Men's Wear, several tight‐faced white men listened intently to Jimmy Dale Jr., a cadav crous sheriff's deputy dressed in blue windbreaker and black baseball cap with “Police” embroidered in gold across the brow, and carrying well‐oiled grease gun with a folding stock. “I nearly got one of them niggers this time,” Dale told them. Suddenly, several more shots stam mered behind the bank. “Everybody off the streets,” the police and dep uties shouted. The Police Depart ment's blue armored car, an old Brinks truck with thick steel plating added around the front and sides, began lumbering down Commercial Avenue. It was getting dark and I decided it was time to get back to my motel. HE “Commercial Avenue Shoot out” on Dec. 5 marked a new stage in the racial conflict which has racked Cairo for nearly two years. It was the first gun battle downtown and the first major bout of gunfire in daylight. But, in other respects, it was only the natural extension of the continu ing violence between elements of Cairo's white and black communities. Probably no other American locality in recent years has lived through such persistent, systematic, stubborn racial violence as this tiny city at the southern tip of Illinois. Since March 31, 1969—when Cairo's current spate of violence began—gunfire has bro ken out on more than 140 separate occasions here. While the major racial battlefields of the sixties—Watts, Detroit, Newark — have regained measure of equilibrium, Cairo's shoot ing goes on and on. But what does it mean? Is Cairo, as some have suggested, merely bizarre anomaly, a monstrous hold over from some earlier era of race relations, an isolated enclave now going through the agonizing accom modations the rest of us faced years ago? Or is it, on the other hand, an ominous portent of the future? Is it, as Mayor Pete Thomas contends, “eight to ten years ahead of the rest of the nation in race relations,” a foretaste of the polarization which awaits us all, the “two nations— black and white” which the Kerner Commission warned us about? Is Cairo our destiny? “ F there was ever an American century, it was the 19th; there was ever an American region, it was the Mississippi,” Peter Schrag has written. And if there was ever an Amer ican city on that 19th‐century Mis sissippi, it was Cairo: a place where the wildest dreams, the limitless pos sibilities of this land mixed with the bitterest disappointments, the, hardest truths. A look at the map reveals a solid base for the city's dreams. Cairo occupies the confluence of the Mis sissippi and Ohio Rivers, the two great waterways of America's heart land, and in an era of river com merce a site seemingly destined for greatness. Early visitors to Cairo noted tendency to think big. “This tiny village gives itself anticipatory airs of a great city,” wrote Jules Rouby, a French traveler who passed through at midcentury. “It aspires to become some day a colossal center of prog ress, the key of all the commerce of the South, West and Northwest.” And Gen. Clark Carr gave full voice to these dreams: “The time is sure to come when Cairo will be the largest city in the world.” The very name—though pronounced “Kay‐ro”—hinted at imperial aspira tions. Its origin is a matter of de bate. Some say the narrow, fertile delta on which the city is situated reminded early settlers of Cairo's site on the Nile. Others say a famine in northern Illinois forced towns people there to trek south for corn, just as Joseph's brethren did cen tunes before. In any case, southern Illinois has long been known as “Little Egypt,” and other towns roundabout — Thebes, Karnak — bear the same stamp. There is the Egyp tian Real Estate Company, Pyramid Roofing and Lumber Company, high‐school baseball team named the Pharoahs. (Recently Cairo even bid unsuccessfully for the Egyptian temple of Dendur, displaced by the Aswan dam.) But from the start, reality never lived up to Cairo's great expectations. In 1842, on an American tour, Charles Dickens was appalled by the strug gling frontier settlement: “A dismal swamp, on which the half‐built houses rot away; cleared here and there for the space of a few yards; and teeming, then, with rank unwholesome vegetation, in whose baleful shade the wretched wanderers who are tempted hither droop and die and lay their bones; the hateful Mississsippi circling and eddying before it, and turning off upon its southern course, a slimy monster hideous to behold; a hotbed of disease, an ugly sepulchre; a grave uncheered by any gleam of promise; a place without one single quality, in earth, or air, or water, to com mend it; such is this dismal Cairo.” Eventually Cairo scrambled out of the muck. Throwing up high levees along both rivers, it held back the flood waters, mud flats and attend ant fevers. In 1854, the Illinois Cen tral Railway opened a line south from Chicago, at last making Cairo the vital depot on a trade route run ning south to the Gulf by water and north to the Great Lakes by rail. For six years, that route hummed with activity. Cairo held a strategic position in another kind of North‐South traffic also. As the southernmost point in the free state of Illinois it was a refuge for runaway slaves—a symbol of freedom dramatized by Mark Twain in “Huckleberry Finn.” As Huck and Jim floated down the river on their raft, they kept an eye peeled for Cairo, for it was there that Jim hoped to turn up the Ohio River to freedom. At one point, Jim cried: “We's safe, Huck, we's safe. Jump up and crak yo' heels! Dat's de good ole Cairo at las'.” But it wasn't Cairo. They had floated by the city in the fog and were back in slave country. When the Civil War broke out, Cairo's strategic location brought new kind of boom to the city. Gen eral Grant established his headquar ters at Cairo in September, 1861, and massed men and gunboats! for a Southern offensive. Merchants of all sorts set up shop to provision the troops. But as so often in Cairo, boom carried with it the seeds of its own decline. Imposing a blockade, North ern gunboats ran the cargo steam ers off the river. With this route blocked, the corn, wheat and beef from the Illinois interior, which had been flowing south to New Orleans, found a new course toward Chicago, from which it was never diverted. By shifting this pattern of trade, the war ended Cairo's hopes of be coming a giant metropolis. Once the war was over, the river traffic revived and brought a meas ure of prosperity to Cairo. By 1890, an average of 10 packet boats docked daily along the Ohio levee, spawn ing shipwrights, boilerworks and grain elevators. But it also brought cardsharps, pickpockets, pimps and prostitutes. The river was awash with sin and Cairo was among the most dissolute of river towns. Charlie Metheny, the 70‐year‐old son of a steamboat cap tain, used to deliver telegrams to Cairo's cathouses — advance reservations from rivermen downstream asked him where the houses had been and, without hesitation, he re called: “On 13th Street, where the deck hands went, they were at 512, 518, 524, 526 and 528 on that side of the street, and 521, 529, 531 on the other. Up on 18th Street where the mates, pilots and captains went, they were at 209, 211, 213, 215, and 224. . . .” ROM the start the city had been prey to criminals. In 1856, 48 citi zens began patrolling the community at night, and The Cairo Times soon reported that the town was “quiet as a claret‐colored cat.” The vig ilantes disbanded when the city hired five policemen, but the vigilante tra dition persisted. In 1909, William (Froggy) James, a Cairo Negro, was arrested for raping and murdering a white girl. Fearing mob violence, Sheriff Frank Davis took James out of town, but a pack of outraged citizens chased him 27 miles, took the black man back to Cairo and shot him. Still unsatisfied, the mob then broke into the courthouse, seized Henry Salzner, a white man arrested for killing his wife, and hanged hirn from a telegraph pole. In his “History of Cairo,” pub lished three years later, John M. Lansden, a Cairo attorney, said these lynchings “set before us in the clear est light the evil that flows from community taking or allowing others to take the law into their own hands.” Lansden also noted another Cairo characteristic — sensitivity to criti cism, whether from Dickens or closer to home. When such criticism is voiced, Lansden remarked, some Cairoites say “it is a falsehood and that Cairo is all right. . . . Others say if it is such a place as is represented one should not publish it abroad and keep people from coming here and in business. . . . And finally, others say we don't care, Cairo is good enough for us; if one does not like the town as is, let him go elsewhere.” (In the restaurant across from my motel hung a sign, “Cairo: Love It or Leave It.”) But within a decade after Lansden wrote, many Cairoites were com pelled to admit that something was wrong with their town. By 1923, Chicago Tribune correspondent could write from Cairo: “Here at the heart of our river system a would‐be trav eler has no more chance to buy a steamboat ride on a passenger packet than to buy a drink over the still immaculate bar of the big hotel back of the levee. Steamboats —real steamboats—are just as scarce as real bourbon in this town.” And with the increasing speed and mech anization of river traffic, most cargo boats no longer laid over at Cairo, either. Today, more freight tonnage passes by Cairo than is handled by any port in the world. That's the trouble. It passes by. Meanwhile, Cairo's other industries have sagged just as badly. Once sec ond only to Chicago in oats sacked, Cairo's oat mills followed the livery horse into oblivion. Cairo used to produce enough cotton to supply two gins and a cottonseed‐oil plant; but the fields were too small to sup port mechanical pickers and now the oil plant and one of the gins are closed. The city was a hardwood center, but as the hills were stripped of lumber it became increasingly ex pensive; the E. L. Bruce Company, the last big manufacturer of hard wood flooring and Cairo's second biggest employer, closed this month. Even sin, Cairo's old standby, has faded in recent years. Gambling be came so rampant—with a dozen slots and a crap game in every road house—that the syndicate tried to muscle in and Gov. Adlai Stevenson ordered state police to close up the games. Prostitution flourished until the late fifties, primarily for the goose hunters who flocked to Cairo in the late fall, but by 1960 most of the girls were gone, too (“Like rats leaving a sinking ship,” one old‐timer. INCE 1920, when Cairo reached its peak of 15,000, its population has steadily declined—to 6,150 to day (about 40 per cent black). But the situation is even worse than these statistics show. For those who have left are chiefly the young, vig orous and ambitious of both races who saw no future for themselves in Cairo. Those who remain are large ly the very young, the very old, the apathetic, embittered and de feated. Meanwhile, the exodus was partly offset by an influx of poor, unskilled blacks from the Deep South. Blacks looking north today are attracted to Cairo in part because of Illinois's relatively generous welfare payments. Almost 30 per cent of its population gets some form of public assistance. According to the 1960 census, of 86 Illinois cities with populations be tween 5,000 and 10,000, Cairo ranks first in poverty with 44.6 per cent of its families living on incomes of less than $3,000 per year. With the city's traditional unskilled jobs—ste vedoring, picking cotton, stacking lumber—now hard to come by, unem ployment is over 10 per cent (more than double that for blacks). About a third of Cairo's blacks live in Pyramid Court, the sprawling pub lic‐housing complex of .two‐story brick buildings huddled against the Mississippi levee. Others live in drab frame houses with sagging porches in the Uptown East section. Those lucky enough to have jobs may make seat padding for the Burkart Com pany, work as domestics or pick soy beans or strawberries in the sum mertime. The tiny black “middle class” is made up largely of school teachers and postal or highway workers. Despite these conditions, many Southern blacks feel more at home in Cairo than they would in a Chi cago slum because Cairo is essen tially a Southern city. Its Chamber of Commerce prose lays it on a bit thick—“where catfish still sizzle in frying pans and canebrakes cluster in the river, where dignified old Southern mansions hear the swish of sternwheelers”—but Cairo is farther south than Richmond, Va. And its racial attitudes are not very differ ent from those of Selma, Ala., or Jackson, Miss. With one major difference. Cairo is near enough to St. Louis, Chicago and Detroit that its Negroes have absorbed some of the militancy bred there first by the labor movement and then by the new brand of North ern black. As early as 1937, something very close to a race riot broke out in Cairo, Following a rally to protest low relief payments, several hundred Negroes marched on the Alexander County Emergency Relief Office and seized boxes of food, then broke into several stores, and beat a mer chant and three policemen. Two years later, a Missouri deputy sheriff was killed by striking Negro workers out side the cottonseed‐oil plant. So it should have been no surprise when the civil ‐ rights movement brought more violence to Cairo. In 1952, dur ing a controversy over school de segregation, a Negro dentist's home was firebombed and two crosses burned on the Mississippi levee. Then, on July 16, 1967, a 19‐year‐ old Negro soldier died in the city jail. Police said he had hanged him self with his shirt, but blacks charged police had beaten and killed him. This time the black community re sponded. Three white‐owned stores, a warehouse and a lumberyard were firebombed. National Guardsmen were called in and for three nights they ringed Pyramid Court. This clash led to negotiations be tween blacks and the city leadership, during which the city promised to hire more blacks in municipal depart ments which had few or none at that time. Some of the promises were kept; most were not. That same July, some 500 whites —including city officials and leading businessmen—responded in more tra ditional Cairo fashion. Led by Peyton Berbling, state attorney for Alex ander County, they formed a group called the Committee of Ten Million (the name drawn from the national citizens' organization Dwight Eisen hower proposed to combat crime) “to protect our families, our homes and our property.” Although the committee members said they were not vigilantes, they wore white plastic Civil Defense helmets (they were soon known as the “White Hats”) and patrolled the streets with rifles in radio‐equipped cars. Many were designated deputy sheriffs or deputy coroners. In September, 1968, Father Gerald Montroy, a young Catholic priest, was assigned by the bishop of the Belleville Diocese to work among Cairo's poor. Charging that the White Hats were terrorizing the city's blacks, he led a campaign which resulted in their disbanding under state pressure. (Since then, a new white organization — United Citizens for Community Action—has emerged:with largely the same mem bership and apparently much the same purposes.) Following three hours of gunfire on March 31, 1969, elements of the black community responded by launching their boycott of downtown stores and forming the United Front. The lead in these moves came chief ly from Charles Koen, the Cairo‐born black who, while licensed as a min ister in the African Methodist Epis copal Church, had recently returned from a year as Prime Minister of the militant Black Liberators in St. Louis. Under his leadership, the Front has been nominally committed to nonviolence, but also pledged to vig orous self‐defense, which means it will “fire when fired upon.” And fire it has. With the city grow ingly polarized around the United Front and the U.C.C.A., gunfire has rattled night after night along “Snip er's Alley,” the scant 200 yards be tween St. Columba's and the police station. Fires have razed white stores, a vacant TB sanitarium and, most recently, the Veterans of For eign Wars building. Two men have been killed as a direct result of the violence and several others wound ed. State police have often been called in to keep the two factions from doing even worse things to each other. So, as Christmas, 1970, approached and the tinsel went up along Com mercial Avenue, Cairo looked much like any small American town at holiday time. But it wasn't. Cairo had known palmy days and a gran diose dream. For whites, the good days were gone and the dream had soured; for blacks, who never shared the good days, the dream lay ahead. And the gap between those dreams and reality ached somewhere deep in people's guts. * * * N the morning of Dec. 6, I woke in my room at the Morse Motel to the rush of state police cars on the asphalt outside. The smartly tailored troopers seemed to be every where in town that morning, and decided I ought to go down and see their chief. Lieut. Don Evers, commander of the special state police detachment in Cairo, is a relaxed but obviously capable professional. “It was pretty rough out there yesterday,” he said. “So I called for reinforcements. We got 24 new men in overnight, which gives us 63 troopers here now. “Things are definitely getting worse here. A lot of the shooting we've had the past two years didn't amount to all that much. Some guy —black or white—would get a bot tle of wine in him, go out on his front lawn and fire his rifle in the air—brrrrp—‐then go back inside. But we'd be up all night trying to find out what was happening. It was just a harassment sort of thing, not really trying to kill somebody. “But lately they've been leveling those shots out. Last June, one of our sergeants was riding by Pyra mid Court and got a slug in the left shoulder. Later in the summer, corporal got hit in the right foot. Completely without provocation. We didn't even return the fire. There's people on both sides of this thing now—not many, but a few—who are shooting to kill. And that's one hell of situation in the state of Illinois!” MY next stop was a diner on the edge of town where I'd agreed to meet Leonard Boscarine, a young re porter for The Cairo Evening Citizen. I'd heard that the police had taken Boscarine's camera away during the fracas on Commercial Avenue wanted to check that out. “Yell,” he told me. “I was up where the deputy got shot and I saw these three black guys spread‐eagled against a wall with police standing over them. I started to take a pic ture and this cop shouted: ‘Hey, you can't take our picture,’ shaking his club at me. Then Charlie Jestus, the assistant police chief, came over and said: ‘Give me that damn camera.’ Jestus knew me and I showed him my credentials just to make sure. But he took the camera and put in his car. We got it back later, but the film had been ripped out. “I was really mad, and I got even madder when I found out the paper wasn't even going to report anything about it. The merchants told our ad vertising man we'd better be care ful what we said about the Satur day events or they wouldn't buy any more ads. I guess that scared the editor because we're not going to publish anything about the cam era. When I told Jim Flannery, the city editor [whose brother is a po lice sergeant] how disgusted that made me, he just looked up and said: A man's got to eat.” Boscarine told me more about his life in Cairo. Born in Eldorado, 90 miles to the northeast, he'd received a journalism degree from Southern Illinois University, then served in the Army as a Vietnam combat cor respondent and a public‐information specialist. When he got out of the Army, The Citizen hired him as its police reporter. “At first, people were really friend ly. They'd come up and say: ‘Hey, how about coming down to the Ki wanis? Be glad to sponsor you.’ But they began to cool off pretty quick after I'd been on the police beat for a while. The Mayor and the Police Commissioner would give out these great statements about how it was the blacks who did all the shoot ing. So I'd go over to the United Front and see what they had to say. There was usually a lot of differ ence. “Hell, at journalism school they taught me a reporter ought to get both sides of a story. But down here people didn't like that. In September, the Mayor and Police Commissioner came in and asked that I be fired. Instead, the paper switched me to the farm beat. After Saturday, don't know what they'll do.” The next day, Boscarine was fired. So I went down to see David Cain, the young Texan who is editor publisher of The Citizen. Cain said he had fired Boscarine because he had become too “emotionally in volved” in the racial story. “He was inclined to use his mouth too much and his ears too little,” he said. “Our readers just came to doubt the veracity of his reports.” (The credibility of news coverage in and from Cairo has been widely questioned in recent months. No na tional news organization has a staff er here. The Associated Press relies on its stringers at The Citizen. Unit ed Press International uses Bob Stout, news director of WKRO, the Cairo radio station whose license re newal is being challenged by the United Front on the grounds that it is racially biased. On Oct. 25, Stout wrote a story about “squads of armed Negro men” making three at tacks on the Cairo police station, during which they fired “hundreds” of rounds into the station at point blank range. But a New York Times reporter who arrived the next day found only 17 small pockmarks on the building's sandstone face—some of which dated from earlier gunfire ‐ —and far more bullet holes in Negro‐owned tavern and St. Co lumba's rectory across the street. Several reliable law‐enforcement of ficials suggest that Mr. Stout's re port was at best exaggerated.) David Cain also conceded that The Citizen did not intend to publish any thing about the camera incident. “In a big city you might feel you had to write about it because you couldn't let the police get away with some thing like that,” he said, “but things are done differently in a small Illi nois town.” One afternoon that week, another photographer had his own troubles with the Cairo police. Carl Hampton, a young black who takes pictures for the United Front, was following a Front protest march through town when police stopped the last car in the caravan, roughly searched its occupants, then arrested the driver for an “illegal muffler.” Hampton was snapping pictures of the arrest when a white policeman sidled up to him. I was standing directly be hind them and heard the policeman whisper: “There's a whole lot of us after you, boy. We're going to kill you, you know that? We're going to kill you for sure.” EFORE I'd gotten to town, I'd been given a copy of a survey on the Cairo Police Department carried out last year by the International Asso ciation of Chiefs of Police on a grant from the Illinois Law Enforcement Commission. The survey concluded that the Cairo police were “generally untrained and incapable of coping with the many problems facing them.” Some of its sharpest criticism was reserved for the police's handling of racial and community relations: “Lines of communication have not been kept open with various groups in the community. . . . In their con tact with citizens, both black and white, officers are often impolite and discourteous. . . There is some evi dence that members of the depart ment, both black and white, have be come personally involved in disputes between various factions in the com munity. . . . Professional law‐enforce ment officers must not take sides in disputes, no matter what their per sonal opinions or values may be.” in other words, the Cairo police were not part of the solution; they were part of the problem. To check these and other allega tions, I tried to see Fred Theriac, gaunt, taciturn man who is Cairo's fourth police chief in 18 months. For several days the desk sergeant said the chief wasn't in. When I fi nally tracked him down, he made an appointment but broke it. That afternoon I found him sipping coffee with his deputy at the Mark Twain Restaurant. When I asked once more for an interview, he refused. “You reporters just distort what we give you anyway, so I ain't giving you any more.” But I did manage to talk to Wil bert Beard, a black who resigned as a police sergeant last November. The International Police Chiefs' re port was out of date in one respect: all four blacks on the department when the survey was made have since quit or retired, and the depart ment is now all‐white. Beard resigned after he was sus pended on request of the part‐time Police Commissioner —Carl Meisen heimer, head of the local Coca‐Cola bottling company—for failing to carry out his orders (assigning men to a detail). “Of course I refused was a trained police officer and he wasn't. That's part of the problem with the department. Even the chief doesn't have the real power. The Mayor and Police Commissioner In terfere all the time in the smallest matters.” Beard's three and a half years on the force were uncomfortable ones. “I felt very isolated. Even though was a sergeant and supposedly in charge of a shift, I'd be out in my car and I'd hear the white policemen talking on the radio about ‘Code 4’ and ‘Operation So‐and‐So’ that didn't know anything about. Every body knew but me. And before shooting spree, the whites on the force knew all about it. It was un canny, but they'd already have men on stand‐by.” Most of the time, the white police men kept their feelings to themselves when Beard was around. But he heard a radio operator say: ‘What we ought to do is go out and drop a bomb on Pyramid Court.” But what bothered Beard most of all were the close ties between white policemen and the U.C.C.A. “A former chief once admitted to me that most of the white policemen were in the U.C.C.A. The White Hat guys were certainly in and out of the police station all the time, carry ing their rifles, and real chummy with the police.” HAT week I got a list of the 36 deputy sheriffs named earlier in the fall by Alexander County Sheriff Donald Turner. The use of deputy commissions to legitimize vigilantes is an old practice in Cairo. Turner, while serving as county coroner some years ago, created 200 deputies. But in June, 1969, when the White Hats were disbanded, all deputy commis sions were called in, and the State Attorney General's office ruled that in the future all deputies must be “trained and uniformed officers with legitimate law‐enforcement duties.” But this rule hasn't been followed. The 36 deputies on the current list include only a handful of trained of ficers, among them Charlie Jestus, the assistant police chief Who con fiscated Boscarine's camera. More over, it included at least five men known to be active, militant members of the U.C.C.A. and several others strongly sympathetic to the group, Among the five militants is Bob Hogan, who in 1953 pleaded guilty to a charge of “malicious mischief” growing out of the firebombing of the black dentist's home. Hogan was found guilty and placed on probation for a year. Today, he is a sheriff's deputy authorized to patrol the streets of Cairo with a rifle or sub machine gun and keep racial peace. One afternoon, I dropped in on the man who revived the vigilante tradition in modern Cairo: Peyton Berbling, county state's attorney and a member of the tight‐knit white oligarchy which has ruled Cairo for decades. They say Berbling's father used to carry a good‐luck charm made from the finger joint of a Negro lynched in Kentucky during the early years of the century. But the state's at torney is a mild, soft‐spoken man in a yellow cowboy shirt and string tie. “A whole lot of fuss has been made about the White Hats,” he said. “A bunch of us up in the Northwest just wanted to get together and pro tect our neighborhood, that's all. They bought these damn white hats for 75 cents, a real bargain. Now if they'd been green, nobody would have said a thing.” But the United Front, he said, was quite a different matter. “It's like that movie, Bad Day at Black Rock'; a gang comes into town and just takes over. The Front has brought in every goddam goon and hoodlum around as a strong‐arm out fit. How do you explain that two of those guys we arrested last Satur day were from Wichita and one from St. Louis? My own wife has been in sulted by these pickets downtown. They've used ugly words, obscenities. And who are they? I don't think single one of them pays a single penny in taxes. And yet they're try ing to put men out of business who've been paying taxes here for 100 NEXT I went to see Lou Michel son, the 26‐year‐old owner of Michel son's Jewelry and president of the Cairo Retail Merchants Association. When he took over the Merchants' Association last spring, Cairo's re tailers were in a bad way. Several stores — including Woolworth's, the mainstay of every Main Street—had closed and others were teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Under his leadership, the association mounted a major promotional campaign to encourage people to do their Christ mas shopping in Cairo: a Santa Claus who arrived by helicopter and set up headquarters in a little red house on Eighth Street, Christmas Cash Sweepstakes, and slogans (“Shop Cairo Where Your Business Is Need ed and Appreciated”). “Sure,” Michelson told me, “we've been hurt badly. But it's not the boy cott ‘that's doing it. Black shoppers’ buying power is limited anyway. It's not even the local whites that hurt us. It's the whites from surrounding areas—Kentucky, Missouri, rural Illi nois. Cairo used to be a regional shopping center. But those outlying people are frightened away by the sniping and arson. So if we can stop the violence, we don't care about the boycott. “But violence is at the heart of the Front's plan and it is a plan. I hesitate to use the word ‘Commu nism,’ but it's like a blueprint to take over a community—no, to de stroy it. First, they destroy the econ omy, then they destroy the educa tional system, then the political and democratic processes, then the civic form of government, then the social and cultural atmosphere. “I believe Cairo was handpicked for this plan because of its high con centration of poor blacks and its limited law enforcement. Once they destroy Cairo, and work all the bugs out of their scheme, they'll start all over in another community.” Who, I asked, were “they”? “The black revolutionaries, the black militants, and here that means Koen. The whites in this community have decided they can't work with Koen. Even a few months ago we were all hung up on this ‘communi cations’ business. The state, the Federal Government, everybody, was telling us you have to ‘communi cate’ with them. Well, we had couple of meetings, but they were farces. You can't communicate with men like Koen. “What proved that to us once and for all was the Front's rejection of our ‘Proclamation for Peace and Progress’ last September. The city and the merchants got together and made the most generous, sincere offer we could: to hire 12 blacks full‐time and six part‐time in our stores, while the city was going to hire six black police trainees and six black fire trainees. Well, the Front rejected it out of hand. Shall I tell you why? Because if they ac cepted the offer they'd have to call off the boycott and if the boy cott is broken their whole thing falls apart. “Eighteen jobs was a good offer. Hell, we only have 60 people working in the downtown stores. And some of those are already Negroes. I've got one—Melvin Paine—who's been with us 32 years. I imagine Melvin's a lot like most blacks here. They don't agree with the United Front, but they're too scared to say so. Koen and his crowd have threatened, in timidated and harassed the blacks in this town until they don't dare oppose them. Well, he's not going to intimidate us. We've had enough. Koen's got to go.” In recent months, this has become the recurrent theme of Cairo's white leadership. It rests heavily on their contention that Koen is not a re sponsible black leader but a “hood lum.” LOOKED up Koen's record in St. Louis, the center of his “militant” activities before he returned to Cairo. It is true that as Prime Minister of the Black Liberators there he was arrested and convicted several times. But one wonders whether these ar rests reflect Koen's violent nature or the St. Louis Police Department's harassment of black militants. Once he was picked up for driving without a taillight and fined $5. An other time, he was arrested for driving without brake lights, failure to display a driver's license and im proper state plates. At the police sta tion, police later testified, Koen and his companion attacked them and the officers had to defend themselves. Koen, who received severe scalp lacerations and two broken hands in the fracas, was sentenced to six months in jail; but the Police Depart ment suspended two officers and rep rimanded four others for using “ex cessive force” in the incident. In another case, Koen and three others were arrested for making “inflam matory and threatening” speeches to a meeting, but were acquitted. Com menting on that case, The St. Louis Post‐Dispatch called the arrests the result of “overzealous and misdirect ed police work” and said it hoped the police realized that “harassment of the militants in an effort to run them out of town regardless of their civil rights will not be tolerated.” But those who know Charles Koen well say he has always had fierce temper. They say his temper was particularly aroused when The Tri‐State Informer, Cairo's white mili tant newspaper, published his birth certificate with an entry “Father Unknown” under the headline: “Does Anyone Know This Illegiti mate?” A friend says: “Charles hasn't forgotten that. And if it makes him bitter toward some whites in town, can you blame him?” Others concede that the United Front, under Koen's leadership, did set out to rid the black community of certain well‐known “stool pigeons” before confronting the white com munity. This effort apparently re sulted in the death of one informer: Floyd Parker. “The way I understand it,” says one well‐informed source, “some blacks started shooting into Floyd's house just to scare him. A stray bullet hit him. It wasn't serious wound, but he was so frightened to go outside he lay down in his bathtub and bled to death. It was three days before they found him.” Another black the Front suspects of being an informer is James Avery, a former Cairo policeman who ran a tavern in Snipers Alley. The tavern used to be a favorite drinking spot among Front members, but when Avery accused two of them of steal ing from him, beat them up and dragged them across the street to the police station, the Front boycot ted his place so effectively that it closed in December. Since then, Avery has challenged Koen's leader ship—calling for an election in the Front and circulating petitions—but he has apparently found little sup port. Just how deep Koen's support runs in the black community is difficult to measure. Only a few hundred blacks—many of them children—at tend the weekly rallies. But there is little open opposition. Front spokes men say they know of only eight blacks who regularly violate the boy cott of downtown stores. Undoubted ly there are others who find Koei too militant but say nothing for fear of what might happen to them. Yet most of the black community seem to regard him as working in their behalf. And white militants are constantly making new recruits for the Front. During the Dec. 5 shootout, one black city employe was lighting the Christ mas decorations along Commercial Avenue when the police turned their guns on him. “What you doing?” he shouted. “You know me.” “Yeh,” one policeman acknowledged, “but we're awful mad now, so get out of here.” ITH all the firing in both di rections, Pyramid Court is a danger ous place to roam at night. So when several other white newsmen and asked for an interview with Charles Koen, Manker Harris, a white minis ter who serves as the Front's public relations man, had to drive us to Koen's small apartment in the housing project. Halfway in, he turned off his lights and gunned the car quickly down the darkened road. In front of Koen's apartment, we waited in the car for several minutes until Manker was sure we'd been recognized. But once we were inside, Koen and his wife greeted us warmly and found us seats in the tiny living room un der a portrait of Malcolm X and mock diploma from the “School of Cotton Picking.” A box of rifle shells rested on the record player. I started by asking Koen about Lou Michelson's charge that the job is sue was just a fake. What issues were essential to the Front? “Sure, we're serious about jobs. Forty per cent of the jobs in Cairo are held by whites from Kentucky. We're half the population and we're entitled to half the jobs. So what do the merchants offer: 12 full‐time jobs! “From government, we want an equal black‐white ratio in city jobs; a black police chief; a black assistant fire chief; removal of Peyton Herb ling as state's attorney; and some real commitment from the Governor to improve Cairo's economy and guar antee racial justice. “But in another sense, you know, Michelson is right. These things are no longer the issue. Because the way the whites responded with the White Hats and guns and armored cars means the real issue for us has be come survival. We stand on the threshold of being annihilated.” Still only 25, Koen has the presence of a much older man. His face is dra matic, with flaring nostrils, a high forehead and all sorts of complex planes and angles. His voice rings with conviction. Someone asked whether Cairo wasn't going through pretty much what Southern communities went through in the early sixties. “Cairo encompasses a lot of the sixties civil‐rights thing,” Koen replied, “But the mistakes made in the sixties aren't being made here. People have learned to defend themselves. We have to defend ourselves because no law‐enforcement body will do it. A little while ago, a black man moved next to a white man here and the white man got his rifle and went to threaten the black man's wife. But Berbling wouldn't issue a warrant for him.” Koen feels Cairo is so polarized now that the situation can be re solved only by pressure from out side: “The man who could bring justice here is the Governor [Richard Ogilvie]. But for him to act would be to jeopardize his Republican power base in southern Illinois. He'd lose his base, but he'd gain his soul.” The Front's leaders do not expect the Governor to act. So they are dig ging in for the long haul, attempting to set up autonomous black institu tions. Already, the Front has formed a black grocery store, a black clothing store and a pre‐fab housing factory; it plans a feeder‐pig pro gram, a broom factory and a shop ping center. MODERATES are very hard to find in Cairo these days. “Moderates are hard to find in any war and, don't kid yourself, this is a war,” said David Cain. “Would you stand in Times Square the day we declared war on Germany and plead for mod eration?” Among the few moderates I found were Bob and Dave Lansden, part ners in the law firm of Lansden & Lansden and grandsons of the man who wrote the “History of Cairo” 59 years ago. The current Lansdens are Princeton graduates and have an un pretentious erudition that makes them seem strangely out of place in Cairo, figures straight out of a Faulk ner novel. Both have consistently stood up for black men's rights at the expense of their reputation and safety. Last Oct. 23, while Bob Lans den was next door at the Mark Twain Restaurant, someone put a volley of shots through their office windows. The other moderate I met is Char lie Metheny, the 70‐year‐old white man who used to run telegrams to Cairo's cathouses. Charlie knows Koen from way back and, as he puts it, “I'm not about to stop seeing him just because some of my white friends don't like it.” When he ac cepted a place on the United Front's Housing Board a little while back, some of his old friends snubbed him down at the Elks' Club and someone put a sign on his door: “Get Out To morrow.” But Charlie doesn't mind. “I'm not pro‐black or pro‐anything. I don't have much time left, so I drink a bit, gamble a bit, see that woman of mine cross the river, and live the way want to. I just think blacks are en titled to live their lives, too. They're entitled to a bit of dignity and self respect like anybody else. Why don't people here see that?”

842-> A MUSICAL GOAL: TO GO NOWHERE
Time moves on, and in its fullness brings us to the time of no movement. For centuries, composers worked to make their music move ahead, or seem to move ahead, employing crafty devices of key modulation, tempo shifts, leading tones and other illusions to suggest progress toward some destination. Now, as the fashion wheel spins, composers such as James Drew give us music that tries to go nowhere. Mr. Drew's work entitled “almost stationary” (1971), given its premiere at Town hall Monday night by the Philharmonia Trio, succeeded in that, at least, The piece, made in one fairly brief movement (or nonmove ment), attempts to build a monolithic, static effect by letting the piano intone one bare chord from start to end while violin and cello hold disjointed conversations in different tonal languages. The result was monotonous, and without enough hypnotic force to make up for lack of impetus and attractive detail. The fact is that writing a piece of music that goes nowhere is not as easy as it seems. Balinese music, for instance, goes nowhere (in Western terms) and is rhythmically fascinating; Mr. Drew's music simply sat there, pulsating now and then, making no point. If we are going to get a rash of this kind of stationary music, we should be aware that some composers do it better than others. The Philharmonia Trio (made up of Charles Libove, violin; Nina Lugovoy, piano, and Aldo Parisot, cello) otherwise performed a conventional program. From the neoromantic bag was plucked Anton Arensky's Trio in D minor (Op. 32), which the trio could not make seem any shorter than it is, but did give a warm and cultivated reading. Beethoven's Trio in E flat (Op. 70, No. 2) had a suitable brio but Ravel's Trio in A minor received an unusually luxuriating performance. The deliberate pace and elastic phrasing of the Ravel contrasted sharply with the more usual lean‐toned and emotionally constrained interpretation. The trio meshed well most of the time, though the pianist struck an occasional weak passage and, especially in the Ravel, tended to overpedal.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 (UPI) —The summer unemployment rate for youths edged up this year to 17.3 per cent although there were 100,000 more young people with jobs in the last two months than in the summer of 1970, the Labor Department said today. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said there were 2,365,000 jobless youths aged 16. to 21 during June and July, an increase of 280,000 over the same period in 1970. The num ber of youths with jobs rose to 11.3 million as the youth labor force increased by 390.000. Officials said the 17.3 per rent jobless rate this year coni pared with 15.7 per cent in 1970, 12.8 per cent in 1969 and 14 per cent in 1968.

847-> Proxmire Bill Would Ban Hormone Given to Cattle
WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 (AP) —Senator William Proxmire, Wisconsin Democrat, announced today that he was introducing legislation to ban a cancer‐causing hormone fed to cattle to make them gain weight faster. A House Government Operations subcommittee plans hearings on the same subject Thursday and Friday. The hormone, diethylstilbestrol, or DES, is fed to an estimated 80 per cent of the nation's beef cattle. It is banned from the human food supply because it causes cancer, but can be fed to animals on the theory they will excrete the chemical before slaughter. However, residues have been cropping up in laboratory tests for years. “Does DES leave a residue in livestock after it has been slaughtered for human consumption?” Mr. Proxmire asked in a Senate speech. “Without doubt, the answer is yes.’

848-> Armco Increases Prices Of Some Steel Products
MIDDLETOWN, Ohio, April 7 (UPI)—The Armco steel corporation today confirmed that it has raised prices of steel products used in the manufacture of electric power distribution equipment by $20 and $30 per ton. The increases, made without any public fanfare beyond notifying customers the increases were coming, were quietly followed by several other steel producers. The hikes work out to about 6 per cent, close to the average which steel industry sources calculate has been applied to a wide range of other steel products so far this year. Steel products raised so far in 1971 include railroad steel products, steels used by the construction and shipbuilding industries, steel products used by the oil and gas industry, and la number of steel bar and rod products.

849-> LINDSAY IS URGED TO CONTINUE LOANS
United Neighborhood Houses, a federation of the city's 34 settlement houses, appealed yesterday, to Mayer Lindsay to continue the Municipal Loan Program, despite disclosures of abuses in its administration. “We believe it would be disastrous if the recently uncovered abuses of the Municipal Loan Program were used as an excuse for ending it,” Dr. Arthur C. Logan, president of the organization, wrote the Mayor. Robert Laird, deputy press secretary for the Mayor said last night there were “no plans under consideration for abandonment of the Municipal Loan Program” “Despite all of its problems, we consider it a vital and viable program,” he said. Copies of the letter were also sent to those investigating the program, which was established nine years ago to make longterm, low‐interest loans for the rehabilitation of slum housing. They include City Inveatigation Commissioner Robert K. Ruskin, Manhattan District Attorney Frank S. Hogan, Controller Abraham D. Reame, and members of a City Council committee. The investigations have uncovered evidence of fictitious mortgages, inflated cost estimates, overpayments and other abuses, and resulted last week In indictments of three lawyers three builders, the wife of builder and two former city employes. Dr. Logan wrote the Mayor that the program needed in addition to stronger fiscal controls, “an imaginative applicaten of the loans” for the upgrading of many buildings with limited expenditures in each, instead of its previous concentration on “large‐scale rehabilitation of relatively few buildings.” “The expenditure of a few thousand dollars per dwelling unit now for essential plumbing, heating, wiring and other essentials could prevent untold misery on the part of numerous families living in deteriorating housing who face a winter without heat or hot Water for much of the time as well as such added hazards as fire, physical illness and vandalism,” Dr. Logan said. If speedy action is taken on the huge backlog of loan applications from laridlords, tenants and community groups, such a large‐scale emergency housingimprovement program could begin to show results before the coming winter, according to Dr. Logan. United Neighborhood Houses has long advocated “moderate” rehabilitation rather than “gut rehabilitation” as the means of providing improved housing within the means of low‐income families, and has been working with settlement houses and community groups to improve 1,000 units by that approach,

850-> Pre‐Gala Parties Rival Gala Extravaganza on Coast
LOS ANGELES, June 14—As Hollywood's million‐dollar fund‐raising weekend passes into history, it's a toss‐up whether the cluster of pregala parties or the Sunday night extravaganza in the Music Center, a benefit for the Motion Picture and Television Relief Fund, was the most notable. Hollywood has always put on a better show than a party. In fact, in the past. the term “Hollywood party” has been used Interchangeably with the term “Texas millionaire” as a description of bad taste. Still, the movie colony has picked up some knowledge of mores during location trips to Europe, and entertainments here no longer resemble the party scene in Grade B movies. Guests lists are released by public relations representatives with as much pomp and circumstances as though they were the list of Queen's Honors. But no one here was prepared for the Pandora's box that a gossip columnist opened last Thursday morning when he released, without permission, guest lists for a couple of dozen weekend parties to be held before and after the gala. A quick reading of who was entertaining whom made it clear that Vere Harmsworth and his wife, Pat, who flew over for the gala from London, were being feted more prestigiously than Princess Grace of Monaco, who came to be patron of the Motion Picture and Television Relief Fund's 50th anniversary celebration. Popularity Explained By the time the former Grace Kelly, who was an actress here before her marriage to Prince Rainier III, flew into Los Angeles in the Faberge perfume company plane with Cary Grant, the Harmsworths had already been honored by Mrs. Denise Minelli and her fiance, Prentis Cobb Hale, the department store tycoon, with a blacktie dinner dance for 70 close friends, upstairs at the Bistro Restaurant in Beverly Hills. And at last count, six other Harmsworth salutes had been held. “In order to understand the over‐entertaining for the Harmsworths,” an observer of Hollywodd hospitality explained, “you must realize that Vere Harmsworth is publisher of The London Daily Mail, which has a circulation of over 5 million. This town is shrewd enough to realize that a party for the Harmsworths here will pay off in publicity there—in London—and now, more than ever, this industry and its personalities need publicity.” A Saturday evening, “come casually beautiful” dinner dance in the Beverly Hills home of Mr. and Mrs. Freddie Fields Polly Bergen) had, perhaps, too many hostesses. The combined efforts of Mrs. Walter Miriscn, Mrs. Jules Stein, Mrs. Armand Deutsch, Mrs. Jack Wrather, Mrs. Danny Schwartz, Mrs. David May, Mrs. Tom May, Mrs. Jerome Ohrbach, Mrs. Jack Benny, Mrs. Frederick Brisson and Mrs. Gregory Peck (each hostess paid a reputed $2,000 to cover the cost of Milton Williams's catering and Lionel Hampton's music) was prettily done but dragged. But the hostesses did succeed in bringing together an intriguing guest list. The Social Mix Included were Lewis Polk, former head of Metro‐Goldwyn‐Mayer; James Aubrey, present M‐G‐M head, who replaced Mr. Polk; Hugh Hefner, the publisher of Playboy who has recently purchased home in Holmby Hills; Bennett Cerf, the New York book publisher whose wife was on the gala committee; Charlotte Ford; Princess Grace; Joe Namath of the Jets; David Niven, who performed a singing waiter in the Sunday evening gala; Senator John V. Tunney and his wife; Gov. and Mrs. Ronald Reagan; Henry A. Kissinger, the Presidential Assistant, and Mr. and Mrs. Deane Johnson (Mrs. Johnson is Charlotte Ford's mother). Mr. and Mrs. Paul Ziffren (he is a lawyer and Democratic national committeeman from California) entertained Friday evening at what could be called a peripheral gala party, so Mrs. Ziffren carefully welcomed guests by saying, “This party has absolutely nothing to do with the gala Sunday night.” Among those Mrs. Ziffren welcomed to her new Old Malibu Road home (it replaces one they lost in the recent Malibu fire) were Mr. and Mrs. Pierre Salinger, the Danny Thomases, Sidney Brody, the investment broker, and his wife, who is the stepdaughter of Mrs. Mary Lasker; Mr. and Mrs. Edward Lasker Jr.; Rosie Grier, the former football pro; Dr. and Mrs. Franklin Murphy (he's head of the Times‐Mirror Corporation) and the Orin Lehmans of New York. Mrs. Lehman is the former Wendy Vanderbilt, and Mr. Lehman is currently producing a play, “The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man ‐in ‐the ‐Moon ‐Marigolds,” at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Los Angeles. A New Sammy Davis The sleeper of the whole weekend party marathon was probably Mr. and Mrs. Sammy Davis Jr.'s cocktail reception upstairs in the Bistro on Saturday evening. It was a new, almost Establishment. Sammy Davis who arrived only a half‐hour late in a dark gray, superbly tailored flannel suit, with Mrs. Davis in equally conservative black. Ostensibly the gathering was in honor of Sylvie Vartan and Johnny Halliday, the internationally acclaimed singers from France, but actually the Davis party signified the star's emergency as a publicly concerned figure. He has been in Washington for several White House meetings with President Nixon and is expected to be named to head a commission to fight the drug problem. The gala itself has been called everything from the greatest show ever presented anywhere, to a wake for an industry that will never return. “Never before have so many stars appeared in one evening, and that includes the Academy Awards, the Emmy Awards, and all of Zsa Zsa Gabor's weddings,” said James Stewart, who opened the show an hour late. The Plaza of the Music Center complex resembled a field of California poppies. Eszter Haraszty, the designer, and a crew of hundreds had transformed it with banners, umbrellas and tablecloths with gargantuasized blossoms. The gala show included the farewell appearance of Frank Sinatra and most of the 5,300 gala guests stayed on into the night to go to the movies. George Cukor, the director, took over the Mark Taper Forum and presented a colossal compilation of extraordinary excerpts from the 70‐year span of American cinema. Vice President and Mrs. Agnew attended the gala with the Reagans.

853-> Building Unions to Stay Outside Pay Board Control
MIAMI BEACH, Nov, 8—The Pay Board will not control wages in the building industry during Phase Two of the Administration's new economic policy. That authority will remain Under the Construction Industry Stabilization Committee, set up last spring to Slow the skyrocketing rate of pay gains in building. The committee has slewed the rate of pay inerease but is still granting raises well abve the 5½ per cent guideline voted today by the Pay Board. “The decisions [of the Construction Committee] will be final, with no appeal to the Pay Board,” John Dunlop, chairman of the committee and a Harvard dean, who is the coinmittee's chairman, told a convention of American federation of Labor, and Congress of Industrial Organization Building and Construction Trades Department today. The independence of the comntittee “will have to conform with certain broad general guidelines” of the Pay Board's policy, Dr. Dunlop said. The pay increases allowed by the Construction Committee have run between 10 and 11 per cent, Dr. Dunlop said, down from the 15 per cent a year previously. However, Dr. Dunlop implied that the pay increases of construction workers would have to be slowed again. “As a realist I expect the standards in 1972 to be somewhat tighter than they were in 1971,” lie said. He did not elaborate. The 12‐member Construction Committee is made up of representatives from the construction unions, industry and, the public. To date, none of its decisions has been challenged by the unions. Generally, the committee allowed large wage increases in the first year of new contracts in exchange for holding down second‐year pay increases. But Dr. Dunlop noted that one union reaction has been a trend to shorter contracts. The average agreement the committee has handled runs 18 months, compared with a 30‐month average in 1970, he said. He said he was unhappy because there was a possibility of windfall profits in the construction industry and little had been done about it. Such windfalls could occur in the case of industry contracts that were bid on in the expectation of larger pay increases than the Construction Committee granted. Dr. Dunlop said he would meet soon with the chairman of the Price Commission to discuss the issue. He said the public members of his Conatruction Committee had met recently with the public members of the Pay Board, at which time the independence of the Construction Committee was apparently agreed upon. Prank Bonadio, president of the Building and Construction Trades Department, told the convention delegates: “We must tighten our own operations and increase productivity so that the union contractor will have a better chance to compete in the market place with the nonunion contractor.” The soaring construction union pay is believed to have led to an increase in nonunion building. That made the building trades more willing to accept controls last spring as well as to end costly jurisdictional strikes, Jurisdictional work stopphges have shown “a marked decline,” Mr. Bonadio said. Donald Slaiman, director of the A:F.L.‐C.I.O.'s Civil Rights Department, and Mr. Donadio attacked building trades critics who said the trades shut out blacks, They noted that the number of minority group apprentices in the trades had increased sharply in the last few years. The delegates passed a constitutional amendment giving more power to their own National Executive Council by allowing the council to merge local building trades councils and to change their jurisdictions. There are 824 chartered councils in the United States with local and state groups often having overlapping jurisdictions.

854-> Washington Notes
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 — The longer the list of pros pective Nixon appointees to the United States Supreme Court, the better the Presi dent's earlier choice, Judge Clement F. Haynsworth Jr., begins to look to some of the Democrats who opposed him. Senator Mike Mansfield, the Democratic floor leader, con fided to report ers this week that he had come to regret voting against Judge Haynsworth when the South Carolinian failed to win confirmation, 55 to 45, in November of 1969. Asked later if he, too, har bored such misgivings, Sen ator George McGovern said: “I have some slight pause about it. I'm not so sure that the difference between him and [Justice Harry A.] Black mup, was as great as we were given to believe. Maybe Haynsworth is about as good as we can expect.” There may be some rever berations of the 1968 prim ary campaign of Eugene J. McCarthy still echoing in the hills of New Hampshire. A recent Manchester poll, taken by Democrats for local pur poses, included a few na tional questions and pro duced a result that may be disquieting in the White House. President Nixon led with 63 per cent, but Repre sentative Paul N. McCloskey Jr. got 28 per cent, with the remaining’ 9 undecided. For a relatively unknown liberal in the state's conservative stronghold, it was a surpris ing showing, most politicians felt. Kevin Phillips, the conserv ative columnist and one‐ time Administration aide, was not surprised. In the first issue of his news letter, “The American Politi cal Report,” he attacked White House complacency toward Mr. McCloskey as “cocky” and predicted that the Californian could win 25 to 30 per cent of the New Hampshire vote. Senator Hubert H. Hum phrey's all‐but‐open Presi dential campaign is moving another step toward, full dis closure. The 1968 candidate flew to California this week end to try to sign up Joseph Cerell, a professional cam paign consultant, to run his primary effort in that state next year. California's June 6 primary offers some 270 delegates on a winner‐take‐all basis. If the earlier primaries leave Democratic strength, divided among the field, it could be a decisive contest. Senator Humphrey's most significant supporter there is Eugene Wyman, a Beverly. Hills law yer and former National Committeeman who is adept at fund raising. No matter what Congress does about repealing, the “equal time” law that in hibits televised political de bates, President Nixon re portedly has no intention of participating in such encoun ters in 1972. White House insiders say the Republican incumbent is not remotely considering of fering this forum to his Dem ocratic challenger, whoever he may be One always available argument is that a President, in such a politi cal free‐for‐all, might acci dentally reveal information injurious to national secur ity. The real argument: Mr. Nixon, in the belief of many politicians of both parties, lost the 1960 election to Senator John F. Kennedy by giving the lesser‐known Dem ocrat the platform of the first televised Presidential campaign debates. He is not going to take that chance again. But television viewpoints differ. Senator McGovern proposed last week that all the Democratic. Presidential contenders—well, at least those with 5 per cent in the polls—engage in monthly debates, with the network providing free public service time. The South Dakotan, who has been answering ques tions and discussing the issues as a declared candi date all this year, said the move would add “a little more lively tone” to the com petition. Representative Wayne L. Hays, the assertive chairman of the House Administration Committee, has had to aban don one of his economy plans for the House Restau rant almost before it began. Recently, he eliminated waiter service for breakfast, forcing members to carry trays from an adjoining pantry. On the first morning of the austerity program, Represent ative James J. Delaney, Democrat of Queens, liked this arrangement so little he threw his tray halfway across the room. The next day the waiters were back.

857-> Pullout Is Not Seen as Threat to G.I.'s in Field
SAIGON, Scuti, Vietnam, May 31—The 70 per cent reduction in the number of American combat troops in Vietnam has left major United States bases and supply depots more vul nerable to attack but has not yet increased the danger to the ground troops still in the field, according to a survey of Amer ican field commanders. The commanders, who were interviewed during a tour of each of the four military re gions where United States ground troops are still operat ing, agreed that the reduction of the American military “screen” around major bases had left the fixed installations more vulnerable to attacks by enemy demolition experts and, to a lesser degree, to rockets that the enemy might not have been able to set up if United States troops were patrolling the surrounding areas. Breaches of United States base perimeters have increased markedly in the last six months, and although most demolition attacks are directed against war supplies, some also kill Ameri cans. In the worst of these attacks, 44 G.I.'s were killed and 76 wounded when the enemy broke into a fire base called Mary Anne just south of Chulai late in March. More recently, nearly two million gallons of aviation fuel was blown up by demolition men who crept un noticed through the defenses of Camranh Bay base on the central coast. The field commanders denied suggestions that troops in the bush have similarly become more vulnerable because, as one put it, “looking for and fighting the enemy is what we're supposed to be doing anyway, and we don't see any more of them coming than we used to.” Brig. Gen. Jack MacFarlane, commander of the 173d Air borne Brigade in north central Binhdinh Province, agreed. “To speak of increased vul nerability of ground units is a misnomer,” he said, “because we're still actively looking for the enemy. We spend 95 per cent of our time looking for the enemy, and 5 per cent zap ping him.” General MacFarlane and of ficers who asked that their names not be used conceded that the pullout of American combat troops might be releas ing more enemy troops to con centrate on fewer Americans, but they added that so far the consequences of this had not generally shown up in in creased casualties. A possible exception may now be developing in the III Corps, which covers Military Region III. Armored cavalry and bulldozer land‐clearing units about 30 miles northwest of Saigon have recently come under increased enemy pres sure since the withdrawal of all but a few of the First Cav alry and 25th Divisions, which used to patrol the nearby bor der with Cambodia. In II Corps, officers of the 173d Airborne Brigade admitted they were apprehensive when the United States Fourth Divi sion was pulled out of its sup porting position in the Central Highlands to the southwest last winter. The officers admitted they had worried about the effect the pullout of the Fourth Di vision would have on their own troops in the field, but added that so far, as their command ing general noted, there has been no increase in enemy pres sure on their troops in the coastal lowlands and nearby mountains. In the northernmost region, or I Corps, American troop levels have declined only slight ly, and the better parts of two divisions and an independent brigade are still in the field there. Their commanders, there fore, agree that American troops there were not more ex posed than before the with drawals began in the rest of South Vietnam. The only direct consequences of the United States pullout that all American commanders admitted—and that some G.I.'s complained about—were that the accompanying reduction in American armor and helicopter gunships had in some cases made the enemy bolder and in others caused delays in the ar rival of United States support for troops in combat. Perhaps the most pronounced effect the pullouts have had so far is on American morale in the field, where some G.I.'s complain of fears of “being the last man to die” in Vietnam. Many of them, for example, said they had believed that they would not have to go into the field after May 1 when they read reports that Defense Sec retary Melvin R. Laird had set that date for the end of Amer ican combat operations. Secretary Laird's original comment this spring on the end of combat operations was changed to “midsummer” by Defense spokesmen. The cut‐off date was made even more in definite by Secretary of the Army Stanley R. Resor before he resigned.

The Lindsay administration has been insist ing that the pro posed city budget for the fiscal year starting July 1 has a gap between out go and income of $1,1‐billion. The Rockefeller ad ministration contends, with lit tle public substantiation, that the Mayor is fudging and that the gap is really $400‐million less than he says it is. Fiscal experts agree that al though budget‐making may seem to be an exact science to the layman who has trouble balancing his checkbook, it is far from that, and as a result, “honest men can differ” over budgets, as one state official put it. These honest differences can be even further distorted when political considerations enter the arithmetic, as some impar tial observers believe is the case in the current haggling between city and state. The major problem is that the city's budget gap is so huge that even the largest tax au thorization that has been men tioned here, about $600‐million, would still result in—or so the city says—a reduction of 55,000 city jobs affecting 30,000 work ers. The remainder represents vacant positions or reductions by attrition. Thus, the Rockefeller admin istration and Republican legis lative leaders, who have just come through their own budget trauma, feel they would have to bear the onus of authorizing a tax increase on city residents and possibly commuters and at the same time take the blame for massive layoffs of city workers. The Mayor, scoring some po litical points of his own, made certain that the state would share the burden of any lay offs by spelling out in advance various budget options and the layoffs that would result from each. Normally, the question of playoffs would be tackled after a budget is completed, not be fore. Now, when the Legis lature authorizes a reduced tax package, the Mayor can blame the state for layoffs. “They'll do a helluva lot to avoid coming to grips with that dilemma,” said a city official. There are two ways out of the dilemma. First, give the Mayor everything he asks for —$896‐million in added taxes and $163‐million in restored state aid. Given the conserva tive mood of the Legislature, that alternative appears virtu ally impossible. There is another. Make some of the gap go away. If the arithmetic doesn't narrow it, let politics do it. The Rockefeller administra tion charged yesterday that the gap was exaggerated by $400‐ million. But, as of this evening, there were few specifics and the city's budget director, Edward K. Hamilton, stuck to his fig ures. “There's no hidden money, the pockets are empty,” he said. State officials had been con vinced before they sat down with Mayor Lindsay and his budget aides last Thursday and Friday that they would find at least $300‐million tucked away in hidden budget pockets and that the Mayor, with a little prodding, would acknowledge a smaller gap in his bargaining with the Governor. The Rockefeller‐Lindsay face to‐face bargaining ended Friday afternoon with no apparent budget concessions by the May or, and less than 24 hours later the charges of inaccurate budget figures and exaggerations start ed coming from the Rockefeller administration. The administration provided some specifics this evening but Mr. Hamilton challenged the figures. Even discounting the heavy political overtones of the con troversy, both sides agree that there can he honest differences over the budget figures and, difference in an $8‐billion budg that go into making a budget. Will the normal growth rate of tax revenues be 5 or 6 per cent? That 1 percentage point difference in a $8‐billion budget amounts to $80‐million. Will the nation's economy continue to sag? Will unemploy ment increase? Will welfare rolls continue to mushroom? These are the assumptions and projections that must be made for a budget just as a homeowner presuns he will continue to earn hipresent sal ary so that he can pay his rent and utility bills or assumes that he will get a pay increase that will allow him to finance a new car. One budget expert noted that those who estimate revenues, whether on the city or state level, are usually conservative in their estimates while those who are estimating spending over a fiscal year are usually generous in their estimates. “No one wants to get burned,” he said. He described a session among budget experts, such as last week's meetings of city and state budget officials, as a case of “trying to smoke each other out to see who's being con servative and who isn't” These sessions between the city and state officials were described as friendly and pro fessional by one participant. The fireworks started only when the arithmetic gave way to politics.

863-> ENEMY REPORTED TO CAPTURE SNOUL
SAIGON, South Vietnam, May 31 — North Vietnamese troops reportedly drove a South Vietnamese task force today from the Cambodian town of Snoul, which United States troops captured more than a year ago. The South Vietnamese ap parently were badly battered. Reports from the field said that the Saigon task force of up to 2,000 men fled Snoul with scores of wounded. As they fought their way across Route 13 toward the South Vietnam ese border 10 miles to the south, they were reported to be disabling artillery guns and destroying some of their trucks and armored personnel car riers. Field reports said that the task force had not been re supplied because of heavy enemy antiaircraft fire, which had hampered aerial resupply, and because roads had been washed out by monsoon rains. Many of the vehicles were said to have run out of fuel. There was no firm count on casualties, but it was reported that more than 100 South Vietnamese wounded, some awaiting evacuation several days, had been lifted out of rear areas by both South Vietnamese and United States heli copters. The retreat from Snoul opens up a supply route for the North Vietnamese, giving them con trol of portions of Routes 7 and 13 that lead into the northern provinces of South Vietnam's Military Region III. This region includes Saigon and 11 surrounding provinces and shares 231 miles of border with Cambodia. Snoul is 90 miles north of Saigon. Lieut. Gen. Nguyen Van Minh, commander of Military Region III, said a week ago that his forces were effectively blocking the infiltration of North Viet namese troops and supplies into the region. General Minh also said that he planned to keep his task forces operating along Route 7 even during the current rainy season. Several other task forces still remain along portions of Route 7 to the west of Snoul and along Route 1, the Saigon Pnompenh artery. Two North Vietnamese regi ments from the Fifth Division, with up to 4,000 troops, are massed in the Snoul area, ac cording to latest intelligence re ports. Two battalions of North Vietnamese troops; as many as 1,000 men, were reported to have attacked Snoul last Wednesday in the heaviest as saults in three months against the South Vietnamese defend ers. There has been heavy fight ing since then. Field reports said that the remnants of the South Vietnam ese armored column retreating toward the border had been at tacked by North Vietnamese troops seven miles southeast of Snoul. There were no casualty re ports available from the field, but a bulletin from headquar ters in Saigon said that 54 North Vietnamese troops had been killed and 15 weapons had been captured. The bulletin said that 16 South Vietnamese sol diers had been wounded. In the northern sector of South Vietnam, Saigon forces claimed a major victory in a sweep through a cluster of vil lages south of Danang, which North Vietnamese and Vietcong troops reportedly had infil trated. Officers in the field reported that 215 enemy troops had been killed in the operation yester day and today. Six South Viet namese soldiers were reported killed and 35 wounded. Nine teen civilians died and 30 were wounded when they were caught in the crossfire, United States advisers said. The advisers reported that scores of enemy troops had in filtrated the villages, in Duy xuyen district, by pretending to be part of a Roman Catholic pilgrimage. The fighting was part of a pattern of stepped‐up action in all four military regions of South Vietnam, ranging from the Mekong Delta in the south to the Ashau Valley in the north. In Saigon, a massive explo sion, apparently triggered by a terrorist bomb, destroyed a downtown building housing tax offices. Rescue workers reported that five Vietnamese had been killed and a dozen injured. It was the first bomb explosion in the cap ital in nearly two months.

864-> Experts Call Life on Waterless Planet Possible
Two Columbia University scientists have reported synthesizing without the use of water a half‐dozen of the amino acids that form building blocks of life's proteins. They suggest that, in view of this, life might arise on a waterless planet. They also believe the finding may indicate the nature of chemical processes taking place in the vast regions of space between stars. Observations by radio astronomers in the last few years have revealed the presence in interstellar space of a dozen or more chemicals thought to figure in the initial steps of chemical evolution leading to life. The scientists are Drs. Goesta Wollin and David B. Ericson of Columbia's Lamont‐Doherty Geological Observatory at Palisades, N. Y. They combined ammonia, methanol and formic acid—all recently detected in space — to form a colorless liquid. For 25 days this was exposed to ultraviolet light from a sun lamp. Such light is emitted by most, if not all, stars. Subsequent analysis revealed at least six amino acids: aspartic acid, glutamic acid, proline, clycine, alanine and valine. It is such, acids that hook together to form the long chains of protein molecules that are primary constituents of all living cells. The findings were reported in the Oct. 29 issue of the British journal Nature and were described further in an announcement yesterday by Columbia.

866-> Nassau South
Mel Lewis was Interviewed on television during the halftime of the Bellmore KennedyLong Beach football game yesterday for his two‐touchdown effort for Long Beach. The second half, however, belonged to the Bellmore Kennedy team that rallied for a 14‐12, South Shore Division II victory. Lewis, a sophomore, deserved the attention he received for running for a 6‐yard touchdown from scrimmage and carrying a recovered fumble 86 yards for a second score. But, fame is fleeting. Neil Hochberg scored twice in the second half on less dramatic, but just as effective, 2‐yard runs. A conversion pass from John Klein to Jeff Burger provided the winning margin. Kevin Hill hit five‐of‐nine passes for 101 yards and Larry Ferrai picked up 112 yards rushing to pace Uniondale over Mepham, 14‐8, and Brian Smith threw a 50‐yard scoring pass and ran for a touchdown and a conversion to lead Calhoun over Freeport, 14‐0, in the other Division II battles. The Scores ?? * Wantaah‐South Side, ppd. (Monday). The excitement in Division IV games was generated by some long‐range scoring as New Hyde Park ripped Valley Stream North, 27‐0; Malverne drubbed Lynbrook, 36‐6; Hempstead hobbled Valley Stream South, 30‐8; and Roosevelt stopped Elmont, 18‐7. The long‐distance heroics were provided by Pete Tomasini (New Hyde Park), who ran 87 and 67 yards to score; Malverne's Ed Fisher (92‐yard punt return); Carroll Banks (90‐yard kickoff return) and Larry Vullo (46 and 10‐yard touchdown runs); Hempstead's Terry Walls who caught nine passes for 189 yards, including scoring strikes of 60, 46, and 11 yards from Carl Whitfield, and Jim Waden, who returned a punt 80 yards to score for Roosevelt. The action was a little wild and wooly in Division I games as well — particularly in East Meadow's 35‐30 decision over Lawrence. The Meadowmen got off to a 13‐0 lead in the first period, trailed. 22‐13 at the half, and bounced back to win by scoring 22 of the 30 points in the final period. Bob Nappi of Lawrence was great in a losing effort. He passed for touchdowns of 22, 32 and 75 yards and completed two conversion attempts. John Zenowitzl of East Meadow threw strikes of 21, 36 and 10 yards and Dan Sciulla ran for two touchdowns and two conversions. Dave Meyer turned in four touchdowns on runs of 19, 83, 5 and 5 yards to lead Bernerover Baldwin, 26‐0, and Oceanside edged Sewanhaka, 7‐6, be cause John Asmolik kicked a conversion after he ran for a 3‐yard touchdown. Wantagh, defending Division III champions, will have to wait until tomorrow to try to even its record after two games as wet weather postponed its scheduled game with South Side. Rain slowed Hewlett and Levittown Memorial, but it did not prevent either team from rallying for victories in games that were played. Levitton Memorial, possibly suffering a letdown after upsetting Wantagh in its opener, trailed Seaford at the half before Dom Malfetone scored on a 20‐yard pass from Gary Kipling and on a 1‐yard run for an 18‐7 victory.

867-> Notes on People
The songs were familiar—“I've Got You Under My Skin,” “I'll Never Smile Again,” “Angel Eyes.” The singer, relaxed, pink‐checked, wearing a bow tie, reminded oldtimers of those days, years ago, when bobby‐soxers swooned at his performances. It was Frank Sinatra, making a farewell appearance at a benefit in Los Angeles's Music Center. “I'm serious about my decision,” said the 55‐year‐old entertainer. “There are lots of things want to do that I haven't done before. I want to meet some girls and build a house someplace.” He stood with feet apart, head back, and seemed never to be in better voice as he sang songs closely identified with him over the last 30 years. “My Way” perhaps bore the most meaning for Mr, Sinatra and his audience: I've had my share of losing but may I say, not in shy way... the record shows, I took the blows.. and did it my way.” It's very likely that Vice President Agnew will be seen soon in Marrakesh and points east. The White House, the State Department and the National Security Council are planning a month‐long tour for Mr. Agnew, across Asia and around the Mediterranean, following his trip to South Korea July 1 to represent this country at President Chung Hee Park's inauguration. Morocco and other oilproducing African nations are on Mr. Agnew's tentative agenda, but he'll avoid Israel and Egypt. Although he'd love to, Mr. Agnew won't be able to visit his father's birthplace of Gargalianoi, Greece, but he will visit Spain and Portugal. When Robert J. Donovan, Washington bureau chief of The Los Angeles Times, was transferred to the West Coast and made an associate editor last year, he was considered to be the likely successor to Nick B. Williams, the paper's editor, who will retire in August. But since The Times's city editor, William F. Thomas, became executive editor and heir apparent to Mr. Williams over the weekend, Mr. Donovan will return to Washington. He will “write whatever he wants,” according’ to one source, although he will not resume control of the bureau. At Flag Day observances in the House of Representatives, the guest of honor was Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower. She obviously did not expect to be called on to speak, for when Speaker Carl Albert eased her toward the microphone, tears welled in her eyes and she managed only a few halting words: “I am so very proud to be an American.” Members of the House, their guests and the packed galleries gave her a standing ovation. All in all, Mrs. Eisenhower had a busy day. She went to Republican national headquarters to learn that a Mamie Doud Eisenhower scholarship fund will be set up at Eisenhower College in Seneca, N. Y. In Jaen, Spain, to celebrate his triumphs on the first bullfight televised around the world, El Cordobes gave each of 50 young admirers a big, green 1,000‐peseta note. The matador could well afford to pass out the bills—the largest denomination in Spanish currency, worth $14—since he earned $100,000 for his evening's work. Shirley MacLaine, the actress and now also an author, became the first woman to speak officially before New York's National Democratic Club in its 137‐year history. She made the most of the occasion, dwelling on one of her favorite topics, overpopulation. “The question of the overpopulation issue should not be left to old ladies in sneakers or seminars in Ivy League schools,”’ she said. “It should be included as a plank in a political party platform.” Besides, she said later, “The number of babies you have has nothing to do with how many times you make love; men don't have to have children in order to be masculine, do they?” It's tough trying to keep up with the Nixon girls these days. Tricia and her husband as of last Saturday, Edward F. Cox, have dropped out of sight, possibly in the Caribbean area. Meanwhile, the other Nixon daughter, Mrs. Julie Eisenhower, flew to Athens and on to the island of Corfu, where the U.S.S. Albany, with her husband, Ens. David Eisenhower, aboard, is due today. The couple will stay in a heavily guarded suite of the new Kontokali Hotel on Corfu, an island popular with honeymooners and young people. Like scores of other Navy wives, Mrs. Eisenhower will be following the Sixth Fleet all around the Mediterranean this summer in order to be near her husband. ALBIN KREBS.

869-> Alone and Homeless, ‘Shutouts’ Of Society Sleep in Doorways
It was 10 minutes to mid night. In 10 more minutes the lights inside the bank would go out. Then the figures in the doorway would be barely discernible amid the shadows. Then would be the time to sleep. There were three. One sat slumped against a fire hy drant, her face buried in her arms. One sat upright in a darkened corner, surrounded by brown‐paper shopping bags. The third lay fully stretched out, facing the in terior of the bank, holding the brim of a battered blue rain hat over her ears. The doorway of the Chase Manhattan Bank is one of half a dozen recessed entry ways on Lexington Avenue between 42d and 44th Streets that serve as places to sleep for homeless and penniless vagrants drawn to the an nonymity of the Grand Cent ral Terminal area. One of them is Elaine, per haps 50 years old. “I sleep different places,” she said. “I don't have a place of my own. Once I had a friend but she got sick.” There are numerous places for doorway sleepers around the city: Pennsylvania Sta tion, the Port Authority bus terminal, Herald Square. Some sites, in Chinatown and along the upper East Side, are new. All have seen an in flux in recent years of dere licts, many of whom formerly slept along the Bowery but who have dispersed largely because of police “clean‐up” drives. But the two‐block stretch on the west side of Lexing ton Avenue is somewhat dif ferent. Those who gather there from 10 P.M. on are mostly women. Some bring bits of blankets, heaps of pa per, and one carries a tiny foam‐rubber pillow—meager belongings that are unpacked slowly and meticulously, with an air of ritualism. They do not appear to be alcoholics or beggars. Some do not respond to questions. Some sit immobile for hours. Some spend the day wander ing the marble corridors of Grand Central Terminal. Some talk to themselves. Soon, the cold will drive them indoors. But on a re cent night, when the tem perature dropped to the low 50's, there were 14 sleeping in darkened doorways or un der the protective glare of a shoe store window. The sight of so many huddled, bedraggled bodies is shocking to tourists from the nearby hotels. Many look down at the sidewalk and hurry by. Others turn to stare, with visible repug nance incredulity or pity. “My God!” exclaimed a visitor from Indiana, “What a heartless city! How long has this been going on?” The question was posed to a news vender on the corner of 45th Street.. She fingered a pile of change and an swered: “As long as I've been here, and that's eight years.” “How long?” said a guard in the post office next door. “Long enough for someone to do something about it. “It's a damn shame,” he continued. “The city is very neglectful. Of course, I don't know what can be done if a person doesn't work to take Care of themselves.” For the most part, those who work in the area at night accept the presence of the vagrants —“as long as they don't bother anybody. But the news vender, Mrs. Sylvia Hoffman, says she has frequently complained to the police, without result. “The cops say they don't even want to touch them, they're so dirty. “We used to have one woman here … she was young, maybe 30 … she was so dirty. She was always scratching. She disappeared about a year ago. “Then a policewoman came. She said she would report it to Washington, that it was a disgrace. But noth ing ever happened.” Mrs. Hoffman leaned over a stack of papers to point to a woman disappearing around the corner. “See that one. She's off her rocker. All of a sudden she runs up to the trash barrel and kicks it… no reason at all. It goes into the gutter and the bus hits it … sends glass flying.” The executive captain of the 17th Precinct, Gregory Moore, says he knows of no complaints having beer lodged. But he is not un aware of the sleeping vag rants. “When I first came here, about six months ago,” he said, “I asked the men, ‘Hey, who are these people?’ I was curious about it, but I've been so busy with other problem I never got back to it. “I feel this way: Yes, they're probably a little nutty. However they value their freedom. And they would die, mentally as well as physically, if you stuck them in some home. They want their freedom and they hold on to it, tenaciously.” The private policemen in side Grand Central Terminal generally follow a policy that calls upon them to eject the vagrants who attempt to escape the elements outside. On a recent night, two plainclothes men knelt down beside a man sleeping at the base of a wall just inside a corridor. His hat and shoes were lined up neatly next to his head. They prodded him with a nightstick. He did not move. They slapped him around the hips and on the chest. He still did not move. Finally, they began rolling him back and forth, like a wad of dough. He awoke, confused but unsurprised, and mumbled: “Okay, okay, I'm going.” Slowly, he pulled his shoes on his bare feet, arranged his hat, and stumbled out the door. One woman named Laura, who looks considerably older than her 46 years, says she sleeps along Lexington Ave nue by choice. Her room on Delancey Street, paid for by welfare, is frightening, she says, because it is so run down and without an ade quate lock. Instead, she prefers a four foot patch of concrete in front of the bank, which she attempts to clean before bed ding down by scraping a swatch of cardboard back and forth. Clutching a broom handle that was split down the mid dle and adjusting a bandage over a leg wound that she said she suffered when an ice cream wagon struck her in a park, she talked of her life as she stared out at the late evening traffic. It was a rambling mono logue, with tales of her na tive Latvia, her journey to this country 13 years ago, a time of employment and relative wealth, a woman who willed her $20,000 that she never received, and ar rests and muggings. Although she said she lost her chil dren in the war, she told stories of ills that had re cently befallen “my wonder‐ ful sons.” “I get along. I feel not well. I feel not sick. My life is a story. I was a scholar, darling, in my youth,” she said. “I met a boy once who was nice. He said, ‘Come with me. I have a place for you.’ But the other boy, he was not nice. He didn't want me around. “When I would be a rich woman, darling, I would buy a lot of clothes. All kinds of clothes. And I would give them to the poor people so they will not be cold.”

873-> Secret Trial
In barring press and public from the extortion trial Carmine J. Persico. State Supreme Court Justice George Pastel takes the position that the accused is entitled waive his right to a public trial as guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment. The court thus accepts the defense counsel's claim that his client, by waiving this right, is actually insuring his right to a fair trial guaranteed by the same amendment. Whatever technical advantage such a stand may hold for the accused—uncertain at best in view of the unpredictable course of any trial—it ignores the public's legitimate interest in the judicial process in general and in this case in particular. The public's right to know is not an abstract theory; it forms part of the foundation of a free society. The First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press is a fundamental rather than an optional. ingredient in criminal court proceedings. The prosecution objected—validly in our view—that Judge Pastel's ruling could set a precedent under which “anyone who is alleged to have any underworld connections, or anyone indeed who has a past criminal record” might demand the right to a secret trial. The case at issue involves charges related to those very aspects of organized crime which victimize large segments of the public. To exclude the public from proceedings in which it has so large a stake and from which important correctives of public policies might be expected to flow is to abridge the people's power in the battle against crime and corruption. The judicial arsenal for the protection of a fair trial includes the issuance of specific instructions to prosecution, defense and jurors as well as the sequestering of the jury. The news media clearly have a responsibility to keep their reporting within limits that conform to voluntarily agreed‐upon guidelines. But resort to secret trial is contrary to the precepts of a free and open society, and dangerous to the process of justice.

875-> Fioravanti Dell’ Agnese Is Dead; Ex‐Manager of Waldorf Towers
Fioravanti Dell’ Agnese, who brought a touch of pre‐World War I courtliness to the Waldorf Towers, which he managed from 1945 to 1965, died Monday night in St. Clare's Hospital. He was 77 years old and lived in Rowayton, Conn. Since 1965 Mr. Dell’ Agnese, had been special assistant to the executive vice president of the Waldorf‐Astoria, of which the Towers is the wing catering to prominent residents and visitors, including many chiefs of state. He came to the Towers in 1931, when the new Waldorf ,opened, as a special clerk because of his command of seven European languages. Two years later he became manager of the hotel's foreign department. Learned Languages Rapidly Mr. Dell’ Agnese was born in Sofia, Bulgaria, where his father was an engineer supervising railroad construction. In addition to Italian and Bulgarian, he rapidly acquired English, French, German, Spanish and Russian. His Russian came in especially handy on Sept. 17, 1959, when one of his most embarrassing situations occurred in the Towers. He was accompanying the late Nikita S. Khrushchev, Premier of the Soviet Union, Henry Cabot Lodge, then American Ambassador to the United Nations, and other dignitaries when their elevator stalled because of a power overload, just below the 30th floor. Mr. Dell' Agnese and the Soviet leader chatted in Russian until the operator got the door open and placed her footstool so that all could climb out safely. “Khrushchev took it in excellent humor,” the hotel executive said. “He joked.” The Soviet leader called it “a capitalist malfunction.” Even with his closest associates, Mr. Dell' Agnese never repeated conversations or incidents involving his distinguished guests unless they were complimentary. His courtesy and discretion were rewarded with decorations from many foreign countries including Norway, the Philippines, Italy, France and Iran—as well as a certificate of appreciation from New York City's Mayor, Robert F. Wagner. As a young man, Mr. Dell’ Agnese worked in St. Petersburg, the old RussIan capital, where he did translating for the Foreign Ministry. After the Revolution in February, 1917, he left the country. He received assignments after the war at the British Embassy in Madrid and later in Washington before going to the Waldorf. Mr. Dell’ Agnese, was born as a Knight of Malta and as a member of the Cardinal's Committee of the Laity. Surviving are his widow, the former Alice Gale, and a daughter, Mrs. David Michael Brown. A funeral mass will be offered tomorrow at 10 A.M. in St. Joseph's Church, South Norwalk, Conn.

878-> BALL STARS' TOUR OF CUBA IS SOUGHT
CINCINNATI, May 1 (AP)— Manager Preston Gomez of the San Diego Padres says he plans to organize a major league all‐star team for a tour of Cuba this fall if the State Department approves. Gomez, a native of Cuba who has become a United States citizen, said that the proposal had the blessing of Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. The plan would enable such Cuban‐born major leaguers as Tony Perez, Tony Taylor, Tony Oliva and Leo Cardenas to visit their homeland for the first time in at least 10 years, said Gomez. He is here with the Padres for a series against the Cincinnati Reds. Gomez‐visited his mother in Cuba two years ago a the in vitation of Fidel Castro. Since baseball is Cuba's No. 1 sport, an exhibition, tour of big leaguers would have good will value for the United States similar to the recent table ten nis team's trip to Red China, he said. “From what I know of Fidel Castro,” said Gomez, “there would be no problem at all. He was a ballplayer himself and he knows the interest his people would have in the game. They keep up with major league baseball by listen ing to the Voice of America.”

879-> Boy Pleads For Play Area and Wins Point
Fifty speakers showed up for last week's public hearing on the Board of Education's proposed school building program for 1972‐73. They included state legislators, district superintendents and principals, community school board officials, parents' association presidents, spokesmen for major citywide organizations and 12‐year‐old Jimmy Rosario of East New York, Brooklyn. His appearance at the lectern in the high‐ceiling, marble hall of the board produced a few smiles and a problem: The microphone was too high for him and board aides had to briefly struggle with the instrument before they could bring it down to size. Then Jimmy spoke. In a loud, clear voice, Jimmy, who was nattily dressed in a caramel‐colored suit and a green shirt, appealed for the construction of a playground on a vacant lot across the street from his former elementary school, Public School 202 at Hegeman Avenue and Berriman Street in East New York. “There are a lot of children in 202,” he told the members of the Board of Education and Chancellor Harvey B. Scribner, who sat on the dais. “They can't come out to play. If they had a playground, they could be on the swings and see‐saw. The older boys and girls could play ball.” He spoke with assurance, almost as if he were addressing his seventh‐grade class at Junior High School 64. The audience of 200 and the officials on the dais listened intently. Brushing a lock of hair from his forehead, he told of the hazards of playing in the rubble‐strewn lot. “We had a couple of accidents last year. I tripped over a tree stump and scraped my knee. One of my friends cut himself on broken glass.” When he finished his presentation, he paused, looked up at the board officials and asked, “You understand, don't you?” The audience roared and the school officials smiled. Dr. Seymour P. Lachman, the vice president of the board and its Brooklyn representative, said that the city school system, whatever its deficiencies, could take pride in having pupils like Jimmy. Dr. Scribner said that plans would be drawn for the playground and that funds for construction would be sought from the city when the plans were completed. Outside the hall, Jimmy was surrounded by reporters and well‐wishers. He admitted that he was “a little nervous” at first but that the feeling quickly passed when he began speaking. The slender youngster, who lives with his parents and three sisters and three brothers at 679 Cleveland Street, told how he happened to come to the board hearing. Some months ago, while in the sixth grade at P.S. 202 he said, he decided to go to a meeting of the community school board of District 19 “to tell why I felt we should have the playground.” He said that the two minischools, intended to relieve overcrowding at the school, had been erected in the play yard of P.S. 202 and that “the children now had no safe place to play.” Earlier this month when the P.S. 202 delegation was being assembled for the city board's public hearing, Jimmy, with the permission of his parents, was invited to join the group. To the inevitable question —What does he want to be when he grows up?—Jimmy replied “a homicide policeman and an oceanographer,” the latter as a hobby. “Whatever he wants to be, he has a great future ahead,” said Mr. Jenkyns, the principal. Then Mrs. Johnson took Jimmy by the hand and led him through the revolving door of the Board of Education headquarters in downtown Brooklyn. It was time for Jimmy to return to the seventh grade at Junior High School 64.

WASHINGTON, May 1 (UPI) —Carlos May extended his hit ting streak to nine games with two singles and a home run to night as the Chicago White Sox beat the Washington Sena tors for the third straight time, 5‐3. The White Sox were leading 1‐0 until May, who has seven hits in his last 12 at bats, cracked his second homer over the right‐field fence leading off the sixth inning against the Senators' starter and loser, Denny McLain. Chicago went on to score two more runs in the sixth on consecutive doubles by Rick Reichardt and Bill Melton and an error. The Senators scored three unearned runs in the sixth on Lee Richard's third error of the game, Frank Howard's double, an infield out, a walk and Don Wert's two‐run double. Tommy John pitched the first 5 2–3 innings to record his second victory against four losses. The Senators could manage only five hits off John and three relievers Don Eddy, Steve Kealey and Terry Foster.

882-> Escaped Convict Tells Of Desalting Invention
KANSAS CITY, Mo., July 24 (UPI) — Warren George Briggs, 34 years old, who made the first successful escape from the United States Penitentiary at Marion, Ill., in what he said was an effort to gain recognition for an invention he had conceived in prison, gave himself up to the authorities today. Briggs escaped on Monday, hid out for two days in wooded country of Southern Illinois, forced a truck driver to take him to St. Louis, hitched a ride with a chance acquaintance to Kansas City and then called a friend to set up a meeting here. He told the story of his invention, a plan for the desalting of sea water, to the prison psychiatrist and a reporter. The psychiatrist, Dr. William Lyle, said he thought the plan “had enough merit to be checked by an engineer or someone with a knowledge of hydraulics.” Briggs, a convicted bank robber, said he had been working six years on the process, which he did not describe.

885-> MARTIN FINDS CURBS ON INFLATION ‘LATE’
William McChesney Martin Jr., former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said yesterday that his “principal worry” about President Nix on's New Economic policy was that it had come “very late,” after “inordinately large” wage increases were built into the economy. Speaking at a meeting of the Institute of Newspaper Con trollers and Finance Officers at the New York Hilton Ho tel, Mr. Martin warned, as he has many times before, of the dangers of the “virus” of in flation that has swept the Western world. Inflation had so distorted the process of saving and in vestment from 1965 through 1970 that the securities mar kets had experienced “exces sive volume, excessive price swings, excessive reliance on convertible securities to whet speculative appetites, … and the return, if I may say so, of wheeler dealers and manipu lators,” Mr. Martin said.

889-> the traveler's world
AVING investigated last week the complicated mechanism of the air bag that is supposed to protect automobile passengers from crash injuries, let us now look into the arguments for and against compulsory installation of them in all new automobiles to be sold in the United States beginning Aug. 15, 1973. The National Highway Safety Administration of the Federal Department of ,Transportation appears to be sold on the air bag because without any action on the part of the driver or passengers it is supposed to inflate in a head‐on crash and protect the car's occupants. Many experts who seem to know as much about the air bag and be even more deeply involved in its mechanics than D.O.T. officials are not as convinced that it will be fail‐safe and ready for assembly‐line installation in August, 1973. Most automobile manufacturers are represented in the Federal Court suit to force D.O.T. to delay its order until the air bag is proved dependable and safe, and guaranteed to do more good than harm. Last August, D.O.T. was able to announce that the air bag finally had been tested with real live people at Holloman Air Force Base, N.M., simulating crashes at speeds between 15 and 31 miles an hour. Volunteer Air Force men were strapped into frameworks simulating car bodies which were accelerated on tracks and allowed to slam to a stop against a water brake. The D.O.T. press release said, “No medically reportable injury was observed during examination after each test.” D.O.T. seems to see the Hellman tests as their answer to tests run at Wayne State University at Detroit in behalf of General Motors and other air bag developers. Live baboons were used there to learn what air bag explosions would do to small children who do not always sit sedately in their seats. The baboons reportedly took a beating. It became clear to some investigators that much work remained to be done to prevent the bags from tossing children out of front seats and against rear windows or, possibly, out open windows. G.M.'s supplemental rocket charge is being timed in behalf of children and baboons to give a slower bag expansion than the pure nitrogen charge. The opponents claim burning rocket fuel generates carbon monoxide, the motorist's enemy found in exhaust fumes, and the air bag pumps this poison right into the faces of passengers. The Transportation Department argues that most people do not use seat belts, so the Government insists that automobile manufacturers must protect these people in spite of themselves. It demands a passive protection system—either the favored air bag or a webbing of seat‐belt nets that snap down automatically when car doors are closed, or, the least favored, heavy padding in the car's interior. D.O.T. rules now call for some such passive restraint by Aug. 15, 1973, for front seats, with extension to rear seats by the 1976 model year. Automobile engineers say making an air bag work in the rear seat is a much tougher job than in the front seat. However, Government spokesmen seem confident the bag will be perfected against misfiring and errors of all kinds by summer of 1973, and the rear‐seat problems solved by the 1976 model year. Summer of 1973 in Detroit really means summer of 1972 because automobiles are designed and dies and tools are being cut a year before production starts. Automobile manufacturers and engineers who have been testing these devices are nowhere near as confident, not even General Motors which is being the good boy of the industry and moving briskly ahead with the development along D.O.T. lines. Ford Motor Company is leading the opposition with advertising and in the Federal Court suit to delay D.O.T.'s timetable. It looks now as if G.M. will lead the procession no matter what the courts decide and probably will supply air bags to other automobile manufacturers when the time does come. The air bag unit shown me by David D. Campbell, General Motors' corporate project manager for all air bag work, was a miracle of trim design and precision. Campbell was justly proud of the work his people have done but his enthusiasm was tempered for he is cautious about rushing them onto assembly‐line cars, noting “air bags will be a good thing.” He would prefer to follow the industry's traditional route—perfect the bags on test tracks for as long as this takes, then feed them slowly onto one of their smaller assembly lines and after working the bugs out in a relatively small number of automobiles, install the proven product in the rest of the lines. As of last month, only 35 live people had tested the bags and then under controlled conditions. These physically fit subjects wore specially rigged Air Force harnesses to protect them against misfiring. The opponents ask what will happen to passengers driving along at 60 miles an hour should the bag misfire when there is no accident. Scientists working with the bag say it goes off with the sound of a shotgun or a Fourth of July cherry bomb or a .22‐caliber rifle in back of the head. They say the sound alone might frighten an ordinary driver into losing control. Suppose, the opponents ask, you have a driver with a bad heart or a nervous woman unaccustomed to nearby rifle fire. Will they panic when a shotgun goes off and a big white bag billows up into their faces in a nonaccident misfire? Bag advocates argue the whole thing is over in perhaps one‐tenth of a second from the time the sensor detects an accident (real or imaginary) and the time the bag inflates, and then immediately deflates. The time lapse Is so short, D.O.T. people say, most drivers would recover their composure before going off the road or hitting another car. It is the frighteningly short time sequence that worries other opponents. With a car moving at 30 miles an hour, the sensor has 25–30 milliseconds in which to detedt the accident deceleration and decide whether it is a bump or an accident; about 3 milliseconds to signal the nitrogen bottle to start discharging gas; then about 70 milliseconds for the bag to inflate fully—all of this happening before the car comes to a complete stop and the passengers start hurtling forward. Total elapsed time should be about 75 thousandths of one second, in the blink of an eye; and it must be precise—not too early and not too late—to do good for anyone.

891-> Memorial Day Observed Traditionally and by Protests on War
Memorial Day. 1971. was ob served across the country yes terday in ceremonies that underscored division over the war in Vietnam and the 45,000 American combat deaths it has produced. For the most part the ob servances were solemn and without incident but they di vided on the themes of tradi tion, on the one hand, and protest, on the other. In New York, gloomy skies and intermittent rains kept the crowds uncharacteristically small. There was an absence of politicians and young veterans, both here and elsewhere across the country. “By the lack of our political speakers, it is very obvious that this is not a political year.” de clared Arthur F. Semerad, chair man of the United War Veterans, at a ceremony at the Soldiers and Sailors Monument at Riverside Drive and 89th Street. In many parts of the coun try, from Seattle to Cincinnati to Washington, rain or the threat of it diminished the usual size of the crowds. The day also saw the re tracing of Paul Revere's route in reverse by veterans in Mas sachusetts who sought to dramatize their opposition to the war. In St. Louis, there was a mock “search and de stroy” mission in a park. Another phenomenon was a scattering of “separate marches” in places like New Rochelle, Media, Pa., and else where. Traditional veterans groups refused to mingle with peace marchers in these places and conducted separate parades. About 400 war veterans and other marchers — compared with a few thousand last year —paraded about 20 blocks up Riverside Drive to the monu ment under the accompaniment of martial airs and a persistent drizzle. Scattered applause from about 200 spectators greeted Mr. Semerad's tribute to “573, 000 American veterans who have used their bodies as a barricade” against the foes of the nation in nine wars. The rain also fell upon 100 veterans and their supporters who gathered at the Eternal Light in Madison Square Park, Fifth Avenue and 24th Street, to protest the continuing war. Last year, hundreds of dem onstrators against the war took part in an antiwar parade down Fifth Avenue. Bob Muller, 25 years old, a former platoon leader in Viet nam and a founding member of the Long Island chapter of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, spoke from a wheelchair at the antiwar gathering. Mr. Muller praised the cour age of fighting men in Vietnam, but he added: “By the same token, those who set the arena for warfare, those who send the politically naive and the instinctively faithful into war only to reap a harvest of blood and of money—those men must be the most despicable that ever were.” Ron Wolin, coordinator of the New York Veterans for Peace in Vietnam, ended the 75‐minute ceremony with the words, “Let's hope we won't have to be here again next year.” Heavy rain reduced the num ber Of spectators at many of the 19 Memorial Day parades in Queens, but parades in Nas sau and Suffolk Counties pro ceeded under overcast skies and slight drizzle. In Oyster Bay, L. I., the guest speaker after that community's parade was Archibald Roose velt, 77 years old, the sole sur viving son of President Theo dore Roosevelt. Speaking on the steps of the Quentin Roosevelt American Legion Post, he told about 100 people, “I'm glad, after all the things I've been reading in the newspapers, we still remember those who gave their lives for our country.” A veteran of both world wars, Mr. Roosevelt noted that yesterday was the first time he had attended a Memorial Day parade in Oyster Bay since shortly after World War I. In other parts of the nation, young antiwar veterans were conspicuous in efforts to dram atize opposition to the war. In Boston, for example, about 200 of them, wearing battle fatigues and carrying plastic rifles, arrived at Boston Com mon on the last leg of their two‐day trek tracing in reverse the midnight ride of Paul Revere in 1775. The veterans, who said they were seeking to “spread the alarm” against the war on Asian battlefields, set out from Concord, two miles west of Boston, on Saturday. Many spent Sunday morning in a makeshift jail at Lexing tin after defying a ban on over night use of Battle Green, site of an early battle of the Amer ican Revolution. About 200 antiwar demonstra tors enacted the mock “search and destroy” missions in St. Louis' Forest Park and inter rogated “captives” who were part of the demonstration. A spokesman said the idea was “to bring the war home.” In Madison, Wis., the tradi tional parade around the state capitol took place without the participation of the Madison Veterans Council, which had sponsored Memorial Day ob servances for 37 years. The veterans organization withdrew from the parade after peace groups announced they would join the march. The City Council earlier an gered the veterans groups by endorsing a resolution designat ing Memorial Day as “a day of mourning and repentance for the human potential that has been wasted and continues to be wasted in the tragic Vietnam war.”

892-> BOND PRICES POST A FEW CHANGES
The bond market, largely shut down yesterday because most banks were closed in ob servance of Veterans Day, showed few price changes af ter a day of light trading activity. Corporate bond prices gen erally closed at the same levels where last traded on Friday. The Government securities market was closed completely, and very little trading went on in the tax‐exempt securi ties sector. In the day's only notable in vestment ‐ banking develop ment, a syndicate of under writing firms managed by White Weld set tentative terms on $25‐million of Consolidated Freightways 25‐year de bentures to be sold today. The securities, rated Baa by Moody's and BBB by Standard & Poor's, are expected to carry a 7.95 per cent interest rate and to be priced at 100 per cent of their face value. This yield is five basis points lower than the investment re turn on the preceding offering of Baa‐BBB‐rated securities. In that financing, $35‐million of Pacific Power and Light Com pany 30‐year bonds sold Oct. 12 as 8's at 100. More important as a general guide to corporate bond mar ket trends will be today's Mountain States Telephone fi nancing—an offering of $125‐ million of 40‐year bonds and $75‐million of six‐year notes. The Ohio Bell Telephone de bentures that were marketed Oct. 5 in the preceding Bell System financing were quoted late yesterday at a price to yield 7.43 per cent. A concur rent $100‐million offering of Ohio Bell notes yielding 6.38 per cent remains 35 per cent unsold. With the market dominated by the view that interest rates are headed lower, at least over the near term, bond traders said yesterday that they ex pected underwriters to con tinue to bid aggressively to buy today's long‐term Moun tain States Telephone issue. With 35 per cent of the Ohio Bell notes still held by the of fering group, however, bidding for the Mountain States six‐ year issue may not be so spirited, they also suggested. If today's telephone deben tures are priced to yield 7⅜ per cent or lower, as some trad ers expect, the market would be getting close to the bottom of the range the Reporting on Gov ernments newsletter is predict ing for Phase Two. “A sharp rally breaking de cisively through 7¼ per cent for the Aa‐rated electric utilities and Aaa‐rated telephone bonds must await solid proof that the program really will curb infla tion,” Lee Cohn, Washington editor of the letter, said in this week's edition.

893-> TWO STORE OWNERS SHOOT HOLDUP MEN
A grocery store owner in the Bronx and a tavern owner in Washington Heights exchanged pistol shots with holdup men last night. The Bronx man was critically wounded in the gunfire. For the Washington Heights man, it was the second time he shot suspected holdup man in five days. The police said that the grocer, Felipe Perez, 51 years old, shot and killed one of two men who had entered his store at 907 East 169th Street in the Bronx and demanded money. The second man had shot Mr. Perez in the neck and right shoulder before he fled, they said. In Washington Heights, the police said, five men attempt‐, ing to hold up the K & R Bar and Grill, 15 Audubon Avenue, fired several shots at the bar before the owner, 70‐year‐old Wilfred Knolls, seized his gun and returned the fire. Mr. Knolls wounded one of the five, a 17‐year‐old youth, before the others tied. Early Saturday morning, Mr. Knolls shot and wounded one of three holdup men. Both Mr. Knolls and Mr. Perez have gun permits, the police said.

894-> Sports of The Times
“The guys are all excited,” said Emlen Tunnell as he followed the Giants onto the Yankee Stadium turf on Sunday just before the game with the Minnesota Vikings. He tossed his observation in the direction of his boss, Alex Webster, the head coach. “I hope it means something,” said Alex cautiously. It meant something. The Giants were so swept up in an emotional binge that they came perilously close to upsetting the Vikes, one of the best teams in the entire football realm. The New Yorkers were beaten in what amounted to the final minute with a heaven‐help‐us pass play that spanned 55 yards and provided the winning cluster of points. The long‐suffering Giant fans were starry‐eyed at the end. They just could not believe what they saw. A Week earlier they had watched on television as their one‐time heroes gave as wretched a performance against the Eagles as could possibly have been given. It was total turnaround against the, Vikings, however. The Giants, even looked good, a description that had seemed impossible of attain ment in all previous games this season. For the first time all year Ron Johnson was back in the line‐up and his return unquestionably was the reason why “the guys are all excited.” Not only did he pick up the Giant ground‐gaining attack, but he seemed able to pick up all other phases of the game with it. Even the Giant defense, hitherto weak and untrustworthy, actually seemed to outplay their more famed adversaries, the Purple People Eaters. Two stabbing distance plays, both involving Bob Grim, did the Giants in. A 56‐yard reverse to the 2‐yard line set up the first touchdown and a 55‐yard pass accounted for the other. Except for these, the Giants had an unexpected dominance, one that was at complete variance with their ?? record in other games. Even in the two victories they scored, they were lucky rather than good. But they were real good against the Vikes, who undoubtedly had used up most of their normal gung‐ho propensities against the Colts in a rousing triumph the previous Monday. Only an hour and a half before game time the inspirational lift was triggered for the Giants. That's when it was revealed to them that Johnson and Tucker Frederickson not only had been restored to the active list but would play. It was the seasonal debut Johnson, the first member of the Thousand‐Yard Club in Giant history the year before. Can one man make that much difference? “I can't explain it,” once said a football sage, “but the addition of a star offensive player usually makes even the defense play better.” Maybe it's all part of the emotional syndrome that is wrapped about the sport, the way one platoon fires up the other to new heroics even though they are distinct entities. A little over a week ago, for instance, the feeble Phila delphia attack ran through and over the Giants without difficulty. But a far superior Minnesota attack was solidly contained. Speaking of defenses, the Jet defense began deterio rating when Joe Namath was hurt before the start of the season. However, this is not necessarily a proper example, because injuries, defections and what‐not have cleaned out most of the personnel. Noble creature that lie is, Coach Weeb Ewbank manfully resisted all temptations to commit hara‐kiri, even when his last body count disclosed only two of his original 11 defensive platooners reasonably healthy. While the Jets were being creamed, 49‐21, by the San Diego Chargers, the Giants were scoring their moral vic tory over the Vikes. So low is the Giant estate these days that their fans are even able to look brightly on moral victories. Yet if they even will pause to figure it out, the Yankee Stadium tenants still lost that game to the Vikings and there are no guarantees that a winning touch is about to be rediscovered. Johnson and Frederickson in the backfield together raise hopes. Fran Tarkenton operates better with them as accomplices and he now has an extra prime target with the return of Don Herrmann as a glue‐fingered wide receiver. The big thing is that Johnson finds holes in the enemy line as if he had a seeing‐eye dog leading the way. So he keeps slithering for those extra yards. In his first game Ron gained 89 yards, and all the other Giants together have only been averaging 95 yards a game. So the pickup is important and the reflection carries into the defense in accordance with those strange, inexpli cable football transmutations. Jim Kanicki has been restored to tackle and that platoon has come alive again. The Jets will be overmatched against the Kansas City Chiefs at Shea Stadium on Sunday. Will the Giants also be overmatched against the high‐riding Chargers at the Sta dium? It's now an intriguing question.

895-> Shift in Court Control Asked in Albany
ALBANY, March 23 — The Joint Legislative Committee on Crime introduced bills today to create a Department of Judi cial administration to manage the state's criminal and civil Courts. Senator John H. Hughes, the Syracuse Republican who is chairman of the committee, said the proposed depart ment would take control of this function away from the judges who now exercise it through the Administrative Board of the Judicial Conference. The department, which would be staffed with “pro fessionally trained court ad ministrators,” would be respon sible for the assignment of judges, the management of court calendars, the employ ment of personnel, for central ized data processing and for es tablishing the hours during which the courts would op erate. The bill embodying this pro posal was one of 18 presented to the Legislature by Mr. Hughes's committee. Mr. Hughes conceded at a news conference that some committee members opposed some of the bills, but he was unable to give a break down on how the committee was divided. One bill, which would estab lish a new category of criminals to be known as “dangerous spe cial offenders,” was aimed at members of organized crime syndicates. Included would be those who earned a large percentage of their gross incomes through crimes committed “on an or ganized basis.” After a defendant was con victed of a crime, a district attorney or other crime‐enforce ment official would ask for special hearing before a judge to determine whether he was in fact a “dangerous special of fender.” If he was found to be, in this category, the judge would be required to impose a minimum prison term of no less than half the maximum provided by law for the crime for which he was convicted. The defendant could not receive a suspended sentence, probation, conditional discharge or a fine of a prison sentence. A “preventive detention” bill would deny bail to those con victed of or in some cases simply accused of crimes in volving serious bodily harm to a person or a serious narcotics offense. This bill provides that a per son arrested for a crime of this kind while out on bail on similar charge, or a person who had been convicted of a similar charges within ten years prior to his arrest, could be denied bail if a judge found at a hear ing that he was a danger to the community. The bills offered by the com mittee could be implemented at this session of the Legisla ture except for the one to es tablish a Department of Judi cial Administration, which would require a constitutional amendment. An amendment must be approved by two separately elected legislatures and then in a popular refer endum. Because of the state's fiscal crisis, many legislators have asked for abolition of some of the present departments and agencies. When Mr. Hughes was asked how he could expect the Legislature to approve a new department, he noted that it could not be established be fore 1973 and said he hoped the state would be in a better financial condition then. A memorandum with this bill said that progress had been made in court administra tion under the Administrative Board but that the judicial system was not keeping pace with the demands upon it. It said only a small percentage of those arrested for felonies were convicted and criminal courts had ever‐increasing backlogs. The Administrative Board consists of the chief judge of the Court of Appeals and the Presiding Justices of the Appel late Divisions of the four judi cial departments. Day‐to‐day administration is handled by a ministrator of the Courts. Other measures in the pack age would require that a speci fied percentage of assistant district attorneys be appointed from a civil service list, and that courts trying felonies would be permitted to hire “judicial assistants” to handle routine administrative matters. Under another measure. a witness who refused to testify before a grand jury or court conducting a criminal proceed ing after being granted immu nity would be guilty of a felony. At present, he may be con victed only of criminal con tempt and, if convicted, sen tenced to no more than a year in jail.

899-> 700 Demonstrate Over Plan to Close A Welfare Center
Seven hundred people pick eted the offices of the Mott Haven Welfare Center, at 329 East 149th Street, yesterday to protest the planned closing of the center and the transfer of its 5,500 cases to three other welfare centers in the Bronx The protesters, who included welfare workers, welfare recip ients and members of com munity groups, temporarily halted traffic at 149th Street and Third Avenue to empha size their demands. One person was arrested. The announcement that the center would be one of five in the city to close on Feb. 1 as an economy move was made by Human Resources Adminis trator Jule M. Sugarman on Dec. 2. Welfare workers and com munity leaders disputed that shutting down the center would result in savings and main tained that many welfare recipients would have to pay double fares to reach the new centers. A spokesman for the De partment of Social Services said that 56 of the center's 203 employes would be avail able for reassignment to other duties. He noted that most of these positions were of an ad ministrative or clerical nature and that caseworkers would continue to handle caseloads.

900-> Progress Against Hepatitis
The rising incidence of illness and death from serum hepatitis in recent years has been a cause of growing concern, especially as the disease is usually transmitted through blood transfusions or infected needles. The re port yesterday by Dr. Saul Krugman of New York Uni versity that he and his colleagues have apparently demonstrated two means of immunizing patients against the disease, is highly encouraging. Dr. Krugman was properly cautious in his announcement, but the pos sibility of an effective vaccine against serum hepatitis now appears brighter than ever before. Particularly for those who need major surgery and the accompanying massive blood transfusions, a success ful vaccine would have far‐reaching consequences. Today the risk of serum hepatitis from infected blood is seri ous, notably in this country where many transfusions are made with commercially bought blood that carries a relatively high risk of hepatitis. There has been much discussion recently of the urgent need to stimulate vol untary blood donations which, experience in Britain and elsewhere has shown, entail minimum danger of trans mitting hepatitis. An effective vaccine would be an even more complete solution to the problem. As so often happens in medicine, Dr. Krugman's ad vance is in part a result of serendipity during basic re search carried on without any, intimation that it would have results applicable to hepatitis. Almost a decade ago a researcher in genetics, Dr. Baruch Blumberg of Phila delphia's Institute for Cancer Research, found a strange particle in the blood of Australian aborigines, a particle he named Australia antigen. Subsequently Dr. Blumberg and Dr. Alfred M. Prince of the New York Blood Center found Australia antigen to be linked with both infectious and serum hepatitis. Their discoveries induced a re search explosion which has greatly increased knowledge of both types of hepatitis and which is likely to provide an effective safeguard against these ailments. It was appropriate for Dr. Krugman to use his lecture yesterday announcing his group's findings as an occasion for warning against crippling cuts in Federal Govern ment funds for medical and biological research.

901-> $25,000 PACE WON BY RUM CUSTOMER
WESTBURY, L. I., May 15—Rum Customer, seeking to become the second pacer in history to earn $1‐million, won the $25,000 Lyss Hanover Pace tonight at Roosevelt Raceway. The 6‐year‐old bay horse turned in the fastest clocking of the New York harness season, 2:00% for the mile. Driven by Buddy Gilmour, the leading driver of the meeting, Rum Customer earned $12,500 for the head victory over Horton Hanover to bring his career earnings to $859,200. The only pacer to break the million‐dollar earnings mark was Cardigan Bay, who started his career in New Zealand and is now retired. Une de Mai of France is the only trotter to have realized that goal. The race was held up about five minutes when Diarac, who went off at 16‐1, the longest odds in the race, stumbled, fell and tossed his driver, Del Insko, to the track before the start. The horse was ordered scratched by the judges and the field for the race was narrowed to five horses, with only four betting interests. Rum Customer was coupled with Laverne Hanover, who finished fourth. There was only win and place betting on the race and Rum Customer returned $2.80 and $2.10 for $2 wagers before 31,184 fans. “I thought my horse went one heck of a mile,” said Gilmour, who turned in his 74th victory in 384 starts. “I used him hard early, the track was a little deep and the weather was cooling off. Under those adverse conditions the horse did very well. Horton Hanover is getting better with every start.” It was the second victory of the night for Gilmour. He won with Dody O'Brien, who paid $13.50, in the first race. Challengers Move Up Rum Customer, starting from the No. 5 post, left quickly, but was beaten to the first turn by Colonial. As they entered the backstretch, Gilmour took his horse into the lead and he led the rest of the way, challenged only by his stablemate, Laverne Hanover. Rum Customer, owned by Kennilworth Farms of Kings Point, L. I., and Louis and Connie Mancuso of Deer Park, L. I., was timed in 29 seconds for the quarter, a minute to the halfway mark and posted a 1:30.2/5 clocking for the three‐quarters. Laverne Hanover, a year younger than his stablemate, moved up from last place at the quarter and dueled Rum Customer to the head of the stretch. In the final strides, Rum Customer weakened and it was here that challenges by Horton Hanover and Super Wave, who finished third, fell short. It was the sixth outing of the year for Rum Customer and his third victory, the first after two successive setbacks at the hands of Laverne Hanover, both in the last two weeks. Laverne Hanover, who had Ed Dunnigan in the sulky, also made his sixth start. He also has three victories. Both horses are trained by Billy Haughton, who was competing in the world driving championships in Philadelphia. In the secondary feature, $17,500 pace, Smokey Rainbow, the 2‐1 favorite, scored his fourth victory in 13 outings this year. With Harold Dancer Jr. in the sulky, the 5‐year‐old brown horse beat Ferric Hanover in a photo finish, returning $6.60 for $2 in a 2:01 4/5 clocking.

902-> Canonero Il's Triumph Dispels Doubts of Experts About His Capabilities
BALTIMORE, May 15—An explosion of Latin joy erupted when Canonero II sped past the finish line today, first in the Preakness, and Gustavo Avila stood in the irons to wave to the crowd. As if shot from a cannon, dozens of men and women from the Venezuelan contingent that numbered, perhaps, 300, dashed onto the track—some crying, some laughing, hugging one another and holding hands high with the “V” sign. “A‐villa, A‐villa” they shouted as the jockey came back to parade his bay colt before the Pimlico Race Course crowd. Crying, wiping his eyes with a handkerchief, Juan Arias, the 32‐year‐old trainer was led to the winner's circle, dancing past a hundred people who) stretched their arms to touch! him. When owner, trainer and jockey were ready to receive their awards, the crowd in front of the dais began singing the Venezuelan national anthem. Avila appeared stunned. When he was asked to step on the bathroom‐type scale that is used in the winner's circle, he didn't realize what he was doing and nearly walked past it. ‘A Nervous Wreck’ Indeed the whole Preakness scene, with its four days of prerace questioning, the doubts about the foreign invader's capabilities, the snickering of many experts, came close to breaking Avila and Arias. Since Canonero II captured the Kentucky Derby the pair has had to be defensive about the victory. Just before the Preakness, Arias raised a shaking hand to his lips and took a deep draw on a cigarette. His lips trembled. “The questions have made me, a nervous wreck,” said Arias through art interpreter. “I've been looking for tablets to calm me down. “ Arias tried to keep his feelings from Canonero II, the colt the public believed in. “It was difficult for me to, stay calm when I was with him,” said Arias. “It took a superhauman effect on my part not to show my feeling.” Avila, 31, described Canonero II's victory quite calmly. while most of the fans in the record crowd of 47,221 were shocked when they saw the colt bolt to the front (he won the Derby rallying from 18th place. Avila said simply, “He got to the front so easy, there was no sense in trying to hold hint back. I let the race dictate the strategy. Really, there was no strategy. The race was easy —easier than the Derby.” Didn't Graze in Kentucky The crowd didn't let Canonoro II's Derby triumph dissuade it from making the Kentuckybred the favorite. The knocks against Canonero II were numerous—he was purchased as a yearling for only $1,200; he had been in the United States too long and the advantage he had had by arriving in Louisville from the higher altitude of Caracas was dissipated; he didn't even graze in Kentucky before the Derby, as the other horses did. Yet, if there was a hero here today it was the horse. Even people who didn't speak Spanish shouted “Arriba” “Up” when he won. Since the great Kelso retired, there have been few, if any horses that the public adopted so readily. A sad “Oh” went up when a stewards’ inquiry was announced when the race ended. Canonero II and Eastern Fleet appeared to have touched in the stretch. But the inquiry didn't concern Canonero II. A clutch of well‐wishers be?? the race did, though. The horse's legs twitched as Venezuelans shouted encouragement from a few feet away. The grinding of a movie camera made his ears perk up. Avila was worried, and his usual smile turned into a frown. He needn't have worried. Yesterday, Arias stunned the raditionalists by parading the gorse in the winner's circle. “I did it to get him used to the crowd and the noise,” the trainer explained. “I did it in Kentucky, too.” No one noticed them, however.

903-> WHITES ARE KEY TO HOUSTON VOTE
HOUSTON, Dec. 8—Residents of white middle‐class and bluecollar neighborhoods, heeding Mayor Louie Welch's call to go to the polls to combat the “bloc” vote, provided the 12,000‐vote margin by which he won a record fifth consecutive two‐year term as Houston's Mayor in yesterday's election. Voters in northwest and southeast Houston, white residential areas that are dominated by shopkeepers and labor union members, cast ballots at a much higher rate than they had in a first primary on Nov. 20, and they provided Mr. Welch with his margin of victory. Although Mayor Welch did not mention race during his campaigning, several of his top aides, including Fire Chief C. R. Cook, said that the Mayor would be defeated unless white voters went to the polls in greater numbers than they had on Nov. 20. Final returns from the election show that Mayor Welch received about 142,000 votes and his opponent, Fred Hofheinz, a 33‐year‐old lawyer and ecoonmist, 130,000. An analysis of Mr. Hofheinz's votes showed that about 65 per cent of his supporters were Negroes, Mexican ‐ Americans and teen‐agers voting for the first time. Mr. Hofheinz, son of Roy Hofheinz who is the owner of the Houston Astros baseball team and the proprietor of the Houston Astrodome, said that the election showed that no future Mayor could be elected unless he listened to the needs of “all of Houston.” This year's city elections was the first time that Negro and Mexican‐American voters were a potent force in Houston elections. The two minorities comprise about 35 per cent of the city's 1.25 million residents. The voter organizations that had helped in registration drives earlier this year are expected to band together again next year to work for the election of a Negro Representative from Houston. In other elections in Houston yesterday, a Mexican‐American, Leonel J. Castillo, was elected city controller. Mr. Castillo defeated the incumbent, Roy B. Oakes, who had been absent from his office for almost a year because of a stroke. In the Houston School Board runoff election, a liberally, oriented organization, the Committee for Good Schools, completed a sweep of the seven‐, member board. The committee elected four members two years ago and won the remaining three seats this year. The new school board, which will take office in January, is expected to reappoint Dr. George Garver as Houston's school superintendent. Dr. Garver was dismissed two months ago by the three conservatives on the school board who were joined by a defecting liberal member whose personnel recommendations had been rejected by Dr. Garver.

904-> City Acts to Seal 33 Apartment House Incinerators
The city has taken the first step toward ordering a shut down of apartment incinerators and commercial oil burners for violation of its air‐pollution control law since the law was upheld by the state Court of Appeals two months ago. Air Resources Commissioner Robert N. Rickles said yester day that he had mailed notices last week to owners of incin erators in 33 apartment build ings and of oil burners in four commercial establishments. Seven Owners Yielding The notices require them to show cause by next Monday why their units should not be sealed. On that day, inspectors would serve summonses on owners of the buildings in ques tion, and actual sealing would take place later in the week. Deputy Commissioner Fred Hart, in charge of enforcement, said that since the mailing, owners of five of the incin erators and two of the burners had indicated that they would comply. Each summons could lead to a fine of $25 to $200. Actual sealing would involve levying a penalty of $25 a day during the shutdown. While an incinerator is sealed, an owner must arrange for other disposal of waste, in cluding pickups by the Sanita tion Department at a charge announced as 63 cents for each 30‐gallon can. The Air Resources Depart ment estimated that 13,500 pri vate and 3,500 public on‐site incinerators, as well as 40,000 oil burners, were covered by the law passed in 1966 and amended in 1968. Enforcement had been interrupted by legal challenges involving stays won by 400 landlords. Rexford E. Tompkins, presi dent of the Real Estate Board of New York, which joined in challenging the law in friend of‐court status, said that the board had begun work with the Air Resources Department to seek a citywide schedule for compliance. The board, he said, is making a survey of the exact status of buildings to match against the capacity of sup pliers and available technology. Commissioner Rickles said later that the board move in volved smaller buildings. He reported that owners of at least 2,000 incinerators in larger private buildings had agreed on compliance schedules, ranging up to a two‐year maximum for some with 100 to 200 units to upgrade. Among other private incin erators, Mr. Rickles said that 700 had been allowed to shut down under the law without penalty; 900 had been upgraded and 160 replaced by compac tors. Of the public incinerators, he said that 2,500 had either been upgraded, were under con struction or were awaiting action under agreed designs. The Board of Education, Com missioner Rickles said, has “al most completed” its share. The 1,000 public incinerators not yet in process, he said, are those of the City Housing Authority, all considered in the program but with engineering not yet completed. No incinerator has yet been sealed under the law.

905-> TAIPEI CLINGS TO AFFILIATE TIES;
TAIPEI, Taiwan, Oct. 26 — President Chiang Kai‐shek of Nationalist China denounced the General Assembly today for having voted Communist China into the United Nations and said his Government would never recognize the validity of “this illegal action.” In a tough 1,600‐word mes sage to the people of mainland China and Taiwan, the Nation alist leader said that his Gov ernment would continue its “unalterable national purpose and holy task of restoring human rights and freedom” to the 700 million people on the mainland He declared this to be “the common will of the whole Chinese race.” “We will tolerate no external interference,” he added, saying his people would never waver or compromise in pur suing that objective. President Chiang said Tai wan, with its sizable population and its military strength and economic prowess, “is not a weakling of Asia or the world which can arbitrarily be sold out by anyone.” He said the Republic of China “will con tinue to wield a strong influ ence in the changing balance of international power and in the determination of human destiny.” The wide‐ranging speech was the Nationalist regime's answer to action in the General Assem bly, which led to the with drawal of the Republic of China. Termination of United Nations membership set off tre mors of apprehension through out this island territory of 14.5‐ million people but there was no sign of crisis. There was an anti‐American demonstration by about 20 young men outside the embassy, but it was peaceful and its par ticipants soon dispersed. Officials evinced bitterness and resentment combined with resignation but were reticent about commenting on what the United Nations action might mean for the future of Taiwan and its Government. President Chiang, in his mes sage, which has been broadcast to the China mainland and will be airdropped there by the mil lions from balloons, called the Peking Government “the Mao Tse‐tung bandit regime” and said it had usurped the rightful position of the Republic of China, a founding member, in the General Assembly and the Security Council. He said the Peking Govern ment had committed enormous crimes against the people of China and “is the common enemy of all the Chinese peo ple.” “The Government of the Re public of China is the true representative of the 700 mil lion Chinese on the mainland,” he said, adding that the current session of the General As sembly had “degraded itself” by disregarding law and justice and “shamelessly bowing to the forces of evil and violence” to admit Communist China. Recalling the failure of the League of Nations, he asserted that history would show Taipei's withdrawal “actually presaged the demise of the United Nations itself.” He said his Government, despite the withdrawal, would continue to be guided by the “purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter,” which it had helped to draft in 1945. The “destiny of our nation is not in the hands of the United Nations” but “squarely in our own hands,” he said, and “as long as we ourselves are strong, no force in all the world can shake us.” The generalissimo, who will be 84 years old on Sunday, pointed to evidences of a power struggle in the communist re gime and widespread opposi tion to it and said, “We must further reinforce our faith, con solidate our strength and in tensify our military prepared ness so that we shall lose no time in grasping the, moment of opportunity.” Significantly, President Chiang laid down no action program and refrained, except implicity; from talking about direct measures against the Commu nist Government. News of the reverse at the United Nations inspired a round of meetings of high offi cials. President Chiang appeared at his city office to see a suc cession of top leaders and Premier C. K. Yen conferred with members of his Cabinet and others. Further meetings between the President and his subordinates are scheduled for tomorrow and the next day. Only in the late afternoon did the general public begin to get the news in the afternoon papers. There were no late morning extra editions to re port the developments. There was some puzzlement and surprise among the public because the papers had been, full of reassuring statements by American and Chinese National ist officials. In fact, there is no shedding of tears here over the loss of United Nations membership. Na tionalist officials look to Pres ident Nixon's forthcoming trip to Peking with greater appre hension. “We can get along well enough without U. N. member ship,” an official said, “What really matters is whether we will continue to get U.S. diplo matic and defense support. If we have physical security, we can make out.” On the other hand, another official showed angry im patience at the suggestion that the future of Taiwan was de pendent on United States pro tection. “We have got to begin to rely just an ourselves,” he said. “That's all we can depend on, and we are now freed of many restraints imposed by our ef forts to win friends in the United Nations so that we can be more independent and flex ible, and without U. N. costs we will save money.” Americans do not feel that anti‐American sentiment will get particularly nasty. There was a flare‐up when President Nixon's plan to visit Peking was disclosed in July, but it was quickly curbed by the authori ties. Nationalist officials find some comfort in the repeated state ments by Mr. Nixon during the last year that the United States will continue to honor its, de fense commitment to Taiwan, but considering the trend in American and world attitudes toward Communist China, con siderable skepticism remains. The Nationalists' attitude, as expressed to Americans here, has been that the United States is misguided and naive and does not realize the conse quences of what it is doing. But as an American put it to day, “You get the feeling that down deep they would like to tick us off.” Officials here tend to feel that President Nixon's prospec tive trip to Peking and the journey there last week by Henry A. Kissinger, his adviser on national security affairs, just at the height of the United Nations debate on the China question played into the Com munists' hands and under mined the Nationalist position. Americans respond that if the Nationalists had gone along with the United States when, in the past, it proposed the two‐China policy that was ad vended during the current Gen eral Assembly session, the Na tionalists would have been able to retain their seat. Knowledgeable sources con sider it inevitable that the loss of United Nations membership and the uncertain future will have an adverse effect on the prospering economy. There has already been some decline in foreign investment and some flight of capital. The stock market dropped and the Taiwan dollar depreciated against the American dollar by several points. The Nationalist officials ex pect a number of countries to “derecognize” their Govern ment soon. It is estimated that the total might reach 10 or 12. The reaction of the native Taiwanese, as distinguished from that of the ruling main landers, has not yet been in dicated but knowledgeable sources say it is likely to be mixed. There will be regret at possible economic damage but no particular disappoint ment on the part of radicals harboring the belief that Tai wan should be independent.

906-> State Auditors Begin City Study ‘To See If Taxpayer Gets Value’
The vanguard of state audi tors who will make he first comprehensive outside investi gation of New York City's gov ernment arrived yesterday at the Municipal Building. They were welcomed at their first stop, the office of City Controller Abraham D. Beame, who had invited the state to look at his operations and who promised his help in their in spection of other departments. “We're here to see if the tax payer is getting value for his money,” said Arthur Gordon, director of field audits in State Controller Arthur Levitt's New York City office, who led the visit to Mr. Beame's office. He said the over‐all inspection would take more than a year and that there would be inter im reports from time to time on the findings in various de partments. Mr. Gordon said that the state team would first map out for itself the functions of each department to be audit ed, then try to test its effi ciency, economy and—even to the extent of asking whether the department ought to exist or not — its effectiveness. Mr. Gordon's boss, Control ler Levitt, said over the tele phone from Albany that what ever data were turned up would be made avaialbe to the state inquiry into the city gov ernment that was set up at the close of the Legislature by Gov ernor Rockefeller and legis lative leaders. “If they ask for the data we will of course comply,” Mr. Levitt said. The state auditors visited yesterday the purchasing de partment of the Municipal Serv ices Administration, the Health and Hospitals Corporations and the Offtrack Betting Corpora tion. The regular Levitt inspection team at the city Department of Social Services was expanded and a letter was sent to Har vey B. Scribner, Chancellor of the city school system, asking that arrangements be made for an “entrance conference.” Mr. Beame, trailed by news men, strolled through the Mu nicipal Building in search of Mr. Gordon. As the Controller stood in the seventh‐floor office of Bernard Cohen, the city's chief auditor of accounts, Mr. Gordon and three members of his 30‐man team strode in Mr. Gordon blinked at the sight of cameras. “It's hard to photo graph an audit,” he said. Mr. Beame, noting that he had requested the state inspec tion of his own department be fore the state law was passed authorizing an over‐all audit of the city, said that his own team of auditors would work with the state. “We'll mesh this to eliminate duplication,” he said. The Levitt audit is one of two state inspections of how well the city government func tions but there are several dif ferences between it and the in quiry that was initiated by Gov ernor Rockefeller and legisla tive leaders in the closing hours of the Albany session. Mr. Levitt's audit is an ex tension to New York City, Buf falo and Syracuse of audits he has traditionally carried on in other municipal governments. The other inquiry is part of the continuing political squabble between Albany and the Lind say administration. But yester day a City Hall spokesman said: “Mayor Lindsay has in structed all agencies of the zity government to cooperate fully with Controller Levitt.”

910-> Road Back Starts on May 30 For Mountain Valley Stables
The long road back will start for Mountain Valley Stables on May 30. Horse Show News On that day, a show will be held at the stable that was hit by a tragic cave‐in last Feb. 10. The entire building housing the indoor arena collapsed. One girl was killed, four other persons were injured and one of the stable's top horses died of injuries. “It happened just four days before our scheduled indoor show,” said Doug Durand, a spokesman for the stables, the other day. “It was a terrible thing, but we tried to keep going.” At the time, the facilities were rented by Richard Vila and Hubert Rohrer. The latter is a former member of the Spanish Riding School of Vienna. Vila and Rohrer then bought the land on which the stable was located because it was the only way they could be assured that the indoor area would be rebuilt. “The new arena is in the process of being built,” said Durand. “We hope it will be ready by the end of June and that we'll be back in full operation by then.” Durand added that the going was difficult after the accident because many of the boarders left. “Now, they're coming back,” he said, “and we hope that with the new indoor area, most of our former riders will be back with us.” The stable is on East Flatbill Road in South Britain, Conn. The show will have divisions for regular, green and junior working hunters; open and preliminary jumpers and equitation. The cause of the cave‐in is still being investigated. The St. Mary's School horse show in Spencer, Mass., on July 11, will try something new in the judging of the hunter division. William Gearin, the show manager, said that the judges will be asked to give oral, affirmative reasons for their selection of ribbon winners. A public‐address system will be set up in each ring and at the conclusion of each class, two or three minutes will be allocated to the judge to explain his reasons for selecting ribbon winners. “We hope,” said Gearin, “that this innovation will serve as a means of communication and education between the exhibitor and the judge and will ultimately serve to improve the quality of the exhibitor.” Gearin emphasized that the judges would be asked to give affirmative reasons only for their selections and that there would be no criticism of exhibitors or horses. A rarity in the horse show world—two dressage events on two successive days—will be held on May 22 and 23. The first will be at Meadow Mouse Farm in Princeton, N. J., and the second at Johnson Park in New Brunswick. The Eastern States Dressage Association will sponsor the Johnson Park show. Both shows will offer classes from the training level to Grand Prix. The Eastern States event, officials said, never has coincided with Meadow Mouse. “In this way,” an Eastern States spokesman said, “riders who come from considerable distances can get in two shows in two days. We are hopeful that this will help in expanding the entries.” The United States Equestrian Team's three‐day riders are expected to compete at Meadow Mouse in the international combined training test.

912-> AMEX PRICES OFF IN SLOW TRADING
Prices ended lower on the American Stock Exchange yes terday in the slowest trading in more than two months. Brokers continued to attrib ute the downward price trend to investors' growing confusion and skepticism over President Nixon's New Economic Pro gram. They attributed the drop in volume to the Veterans Day holiday. Prices opened lower and moved mostly lower through out most of the session. The exchange's price index, which was down 0.03 at 10:30 A.M., finished off 0.07 at 24.88. Declines outnumbered ad vances by almost a 2‐to‐1 ratio as 501 issues fell and 282 rose. A total of 53 issues made new 1971 lows while five stocks made new highs. Turnover on the exchange tumbled to 1,905,935 shares from 3,030,440 shares on Friday. Yesterday's volume was the smallest since Aug. 6, 1971, when 1,897,000 issues changed hands. The A stock of Braniff Air ways led the most active list and rose ½ to 15½ on 57,400 shares. A block of 24,900 shares at 14⅝ accounted for most of the activity. Most of the oil issued lost ground. Dome Petroleum fell 1¼ to 30⅝ Austral Oil lost ½ to 13⅞ the Aquitaine Com pany of Canada eased ½ to 28½ and Westrans Industries was off ⅝ to 12⅜. Clarkson Industries slipped ⅞ to 15¾. The filtration‐equip ment concern said it expected profits for the quarter ending Oct. 31 to be slightly better than last year's 20 cents a share. The Horn & Hardart Com pany of New York eased ½ to 9. The Horn & Hardart Baking Company, which owns nearly 15 per cent of the Horn & Har dart Company of New York, filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act on Friday. Although David I. Sofro, chairman and president of the House of Fabrics, said the com pany would “achieve record op erating results in 1971” the company's stock fell ⅝ to 34¼. Glasrock Products lost ½ to 6⅝. The company reported earnings for the six months end ed Sept. 30 of 16 cents a share against 12 cents a share for the comparable period last year. The majority of land‐develop ment stocks also finished low er. Presley Development fell 1⅞ to 59⅜ the Development Corporation of America slipped a point to 25¼ Punta Gorda Isles dropped a point to 21½, and Deltona was off ⅞ to 31⅛.

913-> New Look for Interior
Rogers C. B. Morton, the new Secretary of the Interior, has set out to get a firmer administrative grip on his huge department. The planned appointment as Under Secretary of Dr. James R. Schlesinger, an expert on systems analysis, and of two new Assistant Secretaries with broad administrative, responsibilities should strengthen Mr. Morton's control. The choice of an Under Secretary is particularly significant in the light of the Nixon Administration's peculiar treatment of this office. When Walter Hickel was named Secretary of the Interior and came under heavy fire from conservationists, Russell Train was named Under Secretary to reassure them. Mr. Hickel evolved into a rather good conserva tionist himself, but he and Mr. Train never overcame the suspicion that had been aroused by his appointment. When Mr. Train moved on to become chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, Secretary Hickel was by then on such bad terms with the White House that Fred J. Russell was chosen as Under Secretary to keep an eye on him. Mr. Russell is what might be called an anti‐conservationist. While serving as Acting Secretary last fall and winter, he purged good officials and sabo taged good policies. It was no surprise that Secretary Morton decided he had better find a new Under Secretary. Against this background, it is particularly important that Secretary Morton not let the opposition of Senator Allott of Colorado and of other Western Senators stand in the way of the Schlesinger appointment. Mr. Morton must have a man as his deputy in whom he has complete confidence and who can help him administer the depart ment in behalf of national, not regional, interests. The Interior Department is not a Western fief. In addition to managerial competence, Dr. Schlesinger presumably has a dedication to the conservation of the nation's resources. Both competence and dedication will be needed if he is to bring bureaucratic warfare under control and revitalize a moribund agency like the Bureau of Mines. However, it will not be possible to provide natural resource programs with coherent leadership until the policy‐making functions of agencies now in other departments such as the Forest Service and the Army Corps of Engineers are transferred to Interior through creation of the new Department of Natural Resources proposed by President Nixon. The demoralized Fish and Wildlife Service provides a critical test of Secretary Morton's leadership. As the March issue of Audubon Magazine points out, this vital agency was stripped of leadership during the Russell interregnum and has had its budget slashed. This agency is the guardian of thirty million acres of priceless public lands and of the birds, animals and fish dependent upon those lands. Restoration of its funds is imperative.

914-> Hunt Show Has 50 Sculptures, Drawings and Prints
At the age of 35, Richard Hunt can look back on an astonishingly productive and successful career as both a sculptor and graphic artist. The retrospective exhibition of his work opening tomor row at the Museum of Mod ern Art contains about 50 sculptures and a selection of drawings and prints dating from 1956. Despite the emphasis on— outh that has overtaken the art scene in recent decades, there are really very few American sculptors of Mr. Hunt's generation who have produced a comparable body of work so early in their development. It is, moreover, a body of work that will be unfamiliar to a great many followers of the New York scene. Mr. Hunt lives and works in Chicago, and although he has exhibited his sculpture in New York galleries many times, his reputation here has remained that of an out sider. To much of the large public that will now see his work at the Museum of Mod ern Art, Mr. Hunt will thus look like something he is not—a new talent. This is, indeed, ironic; con sidering the precosity of his development. For Mr. Hunt is one of those rare artists who, from his early twenties, exhibited an amazing mas tery of his chosen medium open‐form welded sculpture. Taking up a form of sculp tural construction already popularȁ and well‐established in the 1950's, he straight away brought to it a style and a point of view all his own. What distinguished Mr. Hunt's direct‐metal construc tions of the early sixties from those of both his con temporaries and his cele brated predecessors in this medium was, first of all, their very personal linear tracery. Whereas, most con structed sculpture of this sort had very largely been governed by a cubist syntax, Mr. Hunt's work belonged to a different realm of feeling, sometimes suggesting an al most surrealist violence, sometimes evoking an ex pressionist tension and pres sure, but rarely, if ever, re hearsing the familier paterns of cubist construction. As early as “Forms Car ried Aloft, Number 2” (1960) and his “Linear Spatial Theme” (1962), Mr. Hunt was working with a complete assurance and success in this “Wing Bloom,” in welded steel, by Richard Hunt. very personal imagery. I find it extraordinary that a work such “Linear Spatial Theme” is not now better known than it is. It is a work of immense delicacy and force. Later in the sixties, Mr. Hunt began alternating sculp tures of this open, linear expressionist persuasion with work based on a more mono lithic, volumetric form. ‐His imagery remained more or less the same, but a more monumental, more rhetorical emphasis began to make it self felt. The vaguely menac ing surrealist appendages now issued from solid, trunk like masses, and there was a corresponding diminution of those taut, delicate trac eries that—for this observer, at least—constituted one of the special pleasures of his work. Thus, some of Mr. Hunt's most recent sculpture—say the cast bronze “Hybrid Form, Number 2” (1970)— tends to muffle the artist's most personal “hand‐writ ing.” Working in heavy, solid masses has not, so far, anyway, released the kind of imaginative energy that informs Mr. Hunt's best work. Among the sculptures of the last five or six years, the best, I think, still belong to an essentially linear concep tion. The two versions of “The Chase” (1965 and 1969), both large and ambitious works, are real triumphs of the sculp tural imagination, whereas, many of the newer cast aluminum pieces seem to me still exploring a vein that has not been fully discovered. All in all, however, this is an extraordinary exhibition by an artist who remains totally independent of both current fashions and of his own past successes.

915-> Marriage: It's Still Popular in the U.S.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 —The institution of marriage is more popular with Americans now than at any time in the nation's history, Federal statisticians reported today. Their report on national marriage trends over the last 100 years showed that more than two‐thirds of all Americans over the age of 14 are married, while in 1890, the first year for which accurate statistics are available, only half of the Americans of that age bracket were married. In addition, the latest statistics indicated that marriage is increasing in popularity. For example, not only were there more marriages performed last year than in any year since the postwarboom in 1946 — in part because the population has risen — but also the rate of weddings per capita was the highest in two decades. Miss Alice M. Hetzel, the director of marriage data at the National Center for Health Statistics, also noted that reports for the first nine months of this year showed that the number of marriages have continued to rise, although the rate appeared to have reached a peak. The new report, titled “Marriages: Trends and Characteristics,” also indicated that while marriages are increasing, younger people especially women — have seemed in the last few years to be delaying marriage until after their 25th birthday. “We honestly don't know why this is true,” Miss Hetzel said in an interview. But she added that some population experts have pointed out several possibilities for the change—improved employment opportunities for women, a shift in society's view that early marriage is a social necessity for a young woman, or the effects of the women's liberation movement, or a combination of these factors. In their 35‐page report, Miss Hetzel and Miss Marlene Cappetta also note that: Over half of all marriages are performed on Saturday. Idaho, South Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina and, not surprisingly, Nevada, have the highest marriage rates in the country. Unlike World War II and the Korean conflict, the Vietnam war has had no apparent effect on the marriage rate. There has been a large increase in remarriage rates among men, but not women. Interracial marriages are increasing, but they still constitute less than 1 per cent of the total number. The report showed that of Americans over the age of 14 in 1890, 56.6 per tent of women and 53.9 per cent of men were married. The percentages inched upward over the years until in 1960 the respective numbers were 67.4 and 71.2. Provisional data for the year 1967, the last for which there is even a partial breakdown, show the percentages to be increasing, but with one significant difference. The, percentage of women between the ages of 20 and 24 who were married declined abruptly to levels of about a decade before. Yet there was only a slight decline for men of that age. Census Bureau data previously released showed the effects of what has been termed the “marriage squeeze” among women 20 and 21, their most marriage able ages. Between 1960 and 1971 the proportion of single 20‐year‐old women rose from 46 to 58 per cent, while the percentages of their 21‐year old sisters went up from 35 to 47. The report noted that “the behavior of the marriage rate in the 1950's and 1970's was quite distinct from that of earlier years. During this period, that was unmarred by an economic depression but plagued by two limited wars, the marriage rate did not exhibit the stability of the late 19th century nor the sharp fluctuations of the first half of the 20th century.” “It changed from a downswing in the 1950's to an upswing in the 1960's, but the change was gradual with small year‐to‐year differences,” the report added. Turning to the effects of the Vietnam war, the longest in American history, the report noted that the conflict “so far has exerted no measurable effect on the annual marriage rate.” Turning to marriage patterns by states, the authors note that regional differences are most often accounted for by state laws than any other factor.

916-> Russell Suffers Setback In Respiratory Sickness
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (AP) —Senator Richard B. Russell, Democrat of Georgia, has suf fered a setback in his efforts to shake off a respiratory ail ment, an aide said today. Senator Russell entered Wal ter Reed Army Medical Center here on Dec. 8. His aide said that the Senator had been thoroughly examined yesterday and X‐rays had disclosed the return of infection to the lower respiratory area. “The doctors are intensifying his treatment, with stronger an tibiotics,” the aide said. The 73‐year‐old dean and President pro tem of the Senate has suffered for years from em physema. Because of this con dition, any respiratory in fection becomes a problem.

917-> NAVY DELAYS PLANS TO DEPLOY POSEIDON
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (AP) —Plans of the Navy to deploy the first multiple warhead Po seidon missiles this month have been set back—perhaps until next spring—by production problems. “We expect a delay of a few Months,” the Navy today said when asked the status of the advanced long‐range missile that is to be launched from submarines. Navy sources indicated that the first patrols of submarines carrying Poseidon missiles may not start until middle or late spring. Two Polaris missile subs, the Daniel Boone and the James Madison, have been converted to mount the big accurate Po seidon. Each submarine will be able to launch 16 Poseidon mis siles, and each missile will bear 10 warheads that can be aimed at separate targets. The Navy attributed the de ployment setback to “prob lems frequently associated with the initial production of a new weapons system.” The difficulties—which were not set forth—have delayed assem bly of the missiles.

918-> STEINGUT SCORED IN CROWN HEIGHTS
In one of the shortest bursts of community outrage on record in recent years, the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council yesterday released, then retracted, a denunciation of Stanley Steingut of Brooklyn, the Democratic Assembly minority leader. The council first accused Mr. Steingut of “abandoning” and splintering the tightly knit Brooklyn community to seek safer district in the current reapportionment negotiations. But by nightfall the press release was declared “null and void,” Mr. Steingut was once again a friend and another footnote had been penciled in hastily to the traditional political pushing and pulling over reapportionment. The frenetic incident, in which Mr. Steingut met with members of the group and sought to reassure them that he wanted to strengthen, not dissolve, Crown Heights's identity, was one of a number of typical political pressures being felt by lawmakers as they neared next week's special legislative session on reapportionment. Mr. Steingut succeeded in soothing the community group, which declined to go into details on how the fear of gerrymandering arose in the first place. There have been rumors that an additional predominantly black district might emerge in the area as a result of the secret reapportionment negotiations. “The word is that everything's O.K., Heshy Lipschitz, a spokesman for the council, said after retracting the attack on Mr. Steingut, which carried a threat that “one thousand Crown Heights people will follow him wherever he may be compaigning, proclaiming the injustice done to them.” Political sources speculated that the community, which Mr. Steingut has represented in varying degrees over the years, would prevail in its campaign to preserve its political strength as a Jewish enclave in a surrounding, increasingly black area. Mr. Steingut said he had no idea what would become of his request to Republican majority leaders to include all of Crown Heights in his new district. Upstate in a Syracuse office, the process of redrawing the Senate and Assembly districts to meet the one‐man, one‐vote court dictum of the United States Supreme Court was reported at the stage where groggy legislative aides in their stockinged feet wrestled with 20‐foot‐square legislative maps. The session will probably begin later than expected, near midweek, and staff aides have said a balky computer is the major cause of the delay. But minority Democrats scoffed at this, prompting jokes about “smoke‐filled computer.” They contend the delay is due to the traditional process by which the majority leaders — in this case Republicans—try to finesse the minority into a deeper hole. Republican politicians insisted, however, that the technical problems of reapportionment have increased, owing, they contend, to confusing court pronouncements. Working with formulas that equalize districts, the Republicans said they are faced with such unwanted situations as the possibility of a tripartite Senate district involving parts of Westchester, Rockland and Orange Counties. Other, twopart districts are likely along the Bronx‐Westchester, QueensNassau and Nassau‐Suffolk borders, they said. The Senate will be increased from 57 to 60 members, with the new seats going to the suburbs and upstate. The Assembly will remain at 150, but New York City will lose three seats, upstate will lose one and and the suburbs, mainly Suffolk County, will pick up four. Sources said the Republican leadership had a number of political decisions remaining before technicians could finish the mapping detail.

919-> PAPER SAYS REBOZO WON PACT ON 4TH BID
MIAMI, Oct. 25 (AP)—The Miami Herald says that Charles G. Rebozo's land title company was given a fourth chance to bid on a lucrative Government contract—and won it— despite earlier lower bids by its sole competitior. Mr. Rebozo, a friend of Presi dent Nixon, could not be reached for comment. The Herald said in today's editions that Mr. Rebozo'ss Monroe Land and Title Com pany and the Title Guarantee Company of Coral Gables were the only bidders for a contract to handle land title services for 67 square miles of privately owned land within the north west arm of the Everglades National Park. On the fourth round, Mr. Rebozo'ss company bid $233,315 —$11,685 below Title Guarantee —and was awarded the con tract, The Herald said. The Herald said the first bids were rejected on the basis of a change in Federal require ments, the second because of apparent confusion by the bid ders over terms of the contract and the third on technical grounds involving state and Federal laws. The four bids spanned the period from July, 1970, to July, 1971.

920-> Supreme Court to Weigh Curb on Judges’ Power
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11—The power of judges to mete out punishment for criminal con tempt against persons who dis turb their courtrooms will be considered by the Supreme Court later this year. The matter was an issue last year at the conspiracy trial of the Chicago Seven. The Court announced today that it would hear the appeal or Robert Johnson, a young black civil rights worker, who was sentenced to four months in prison by a Mississippi judge two years after Mr. Johnson exchanged words with a bailiff in court. The case will give the Court an opportunity to comment on several questions raised by con tempt terms handed down last February by Federal District Judge Julius J. Hoffman against defendants and lawyers in the Chicago trial. Questions Raised Among the questions posed by both cases are whether or not a judge other than the one who feels insulted should han dle the contempt charges and whether or not the judge should be permitted to impose a pun ishment summarily, without serving formal charges on the defendant and giving him a full trial on them. The Chicago con tempt terms are still being con sidered by lower courts and may not reach the Supreme Court for months. Mr. Johnson's appeal illus trates the conflicts that occa sionally arise between the tra ditional power of judges to maintain discipline in their courtrooms through summary use of the contempt power and the rights of defendants not to be judged by jurists who have an emotional stake in the matter. On Jan. 23, 1967, Mr. John son, then a 20‐year‐old civil rights worker in Grenada Coun ty, Miss., exchanged brief but heated words with a bailiff in the courtroom of Circuit Court Judge Marshall Perry. Earlier, in open court, Judge Perry had called rights work ers “pro‐Socialist and pro‐Com munist agitators” and had commented that their lawyers were mostly from New York and Washington and were “90 per cent Jews.” He sought to sentence Mr. Johnson promptly for the court room incident, but the case was delayed for two years by ap peals. In 1969, Mr. Johnson finally came before Judge Per ry, who summarily sentenced him to four months in jail with out a trial. The Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the judge's au thority to do this as a means of maintaining decorum in his court but reduced the term to one month. The Supreme Court will hear arguments this spring on Mr. Johnson's contention that an other judge should have heard the case and that a full defense should have been permitted. No Argued Cases Today marked the second scheduled “decision Monday” of the current court term in which no decisions on argued cases were handed down. For about a century the Supreme Court had issued most of its opinions on Mon day, but recently the Court be came concerned that this was resulting in high overtime pay ments to the printers in the Court's printing shop. To cut costs, the Court is now attempt ing to issue its opinions later in the week, so that the print ing can be done during normal business hours. The Court agreed today to review a lower court's ruling that customs inspectors must have stronger reasons than an “aroused suspicion” to make travelers entering the country disrobe for searches of their clothing. Traditionally the courts have said that the Con stitution's search warrant re quirements do not apply at ports of entry, but the United States Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that suspicion is not enough to warrant a search. It overturned the nar cotics conviction of a young woman who as searched on, suspicion and was found to be smuggling heroin. The Court refused to hear an appeal by victims of the Santa Barbara, Calif., oil spill of 1969, who are seeking to halt further offshore drilling in the Santa Barbara Channel. Lower courts had rejected their con tention that the Constitution requires public hearings before drilling can commence.

921-> Wilkins Tells N.A.A.C.P. Elections Show Blacks Working Within System
Roy Wilkins, executive di rector of the National Associa tion for the Advancement of Colored People, said yesterday that the November elections proved that “millions of Negro Americans—the overwhelming majority—have chosen to work within the framework of the American system.” Mr. Wilkins, the leader of the largest and oldest national civil rights organization in the coun try, spoke at the organization's 62d annual meeting, held yes terday at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. He said also that N.A.A.C.P. programs had brought $29 million in surety bond money to Negro contracting com panies; that he rated President Nixon's actions as “95 per cent” antiblack; that 18‐year olds voting in Federal elections would help the cause of civil rights, and that a loss of more than 100,000 members by the N.A.A.C.P. last year was mostly attributable to a rise in mem bership costs from $2 to $4 a year. In 1969 the organization had 462,000 members; last year the figure was 361,000. Mr. Wilkins told leaders of the association's 1,700 chapters that while Negroes “have grie vous complaints” and “are vic tims of widespread discrimina tion because of race. . . they are not about to run away and ‘go it alone.’” Their participation in the November elections, where they increased the number of blacks in the House of Representa tives to 12 from nine and won other elective offices around the country, was but partial proof of this, Mr. Wilkins con tended. He said: “The elections said that Negro Americans intend to cut themselves in on the rewards of the American sys tem while working zealously to reform that system.” In a discussion of the or ganization's labor programs, Mr. Wilkins said: “We can now report that the N.A.A.C.P. is breaking the stranglehold of powerful banks and insurance companies that have for gen erations refused to provide surety bonds to black builders.” He said that the N.A.A.C.P. sponsored National Afro‐Ameri can Builders, Inc., had raised $29‐million for surety bonds that allowed Negro contractors in 21 states to work “on $878 million worth of private and public construction. The program is headed by the association's labor chair man, Herbert Hill. Mr. Hill said yesterday that three principal effects of the bonding money were to “break the lily‐white stranglehold of the building trades unions and contractors on job opportunities, bring ad ditional millions of dollars into the black community and create alternative routes for black youths into the construction trades.” Still another effect, Mr. Hill said, is to provide employment for “95 per cent of the skilled black craftsmen” in the United States, many of whom, he said, are still not allowed to join trade unions. Mr. Wilkins was asked by a reporter whether he agreed with an assessment made last July by the chairman of the association's national board, Bishop Stephen G. Spottswood of the African Methodist Epis copal Zion Church, that Pres ident Nixon was “antiblack.” In quiet, measured tones, Mr. Wilkins rated Mr. Nixon as “95 per cent antiblack.” He gave some qualified praise for the President's proposed family assistance plan, which would place a $1,600 floor on incomes because, Mr. Wilkins said, this would help the Southern rural poor. But he added that the Pres ident, in “walking the fence, first assuring black Americans and then assuring white pro fessional Southerners,” had failed to take positive action on black employment, school desegregation and integration of housing. “By their deeds shall ye know them,” Mr. Wilkins said.

922-> Sea Dumping of Waste Off San Francisco Is Banned
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 3 (AP) — Waste disposal, which biologists found had damaged sea life, is banned in a semi circle of the Pacific Ocean stretching 33 miles from San Francisco. The prohibition, ordered by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, became effective Jan. 1 and is being policed by the Coast Guard, the State Fish and Game De partment “and even volunteers such as airline pilots and pri vate yachtsmen,” according to William G. Weber, chairman of the control board. Violators can be fined $6, 000 a day under a tough state law enacted last year, he said. The ban extends to seagoing ships, “which have had a habit of dumping before arriving in port,” Mr. Weber said. Exception to Law An exception is 600,000 cu bic yards of mud dredged from canal projects annually by the Army Corps of Engineers, “but this contains no chemicals or any other matter that could affect the rich marine nursery grounds along the shore and extending out to the Farallon Islands,” Mr. Weber said. The authority to invoke the ban exists because the Faral lones, 30 miles off San Fran cisco, are part of the state “and it's a headlands‐to‐head lands proposition extending from Point Reyes to the north to Half Moon Bay to the south,” he said. Mr. Weber said that officials knew of no other such enforce ment by any state or Federal agency on dumping off Ameri can coasts. Concern over the fouling of open coastal waters grew else where in the last year. In New York City, for example, wide circulation was given to a re port that dumping carried out under Army permits had turned 20 square miles of the harbor into a “dead sea.” The dumping of sludge and contaminated spoil was also polluting the New York‐New Jersey area's commercial shell fish beds, according to Repre sentative Richard L. Ottinger, Demcrat of Westchester Coun ty. He urged enforcement of a 71‐year‐old Federal law that prohibits discharge of any ref use except sewage into virtual ly any American waters. In addition to the Gulf of Farallones ban, three companies have been given 1971 deadlines to stop barging wastes to ocean areas beyond the gulf “that could affect the state of Cal fornia,” Mr. Weber said. He added that the extensive prohibition was decided on “aft er pretty conclusive testimony by biologists that sea life is being injured by acids and oth er wastes being dumped into the sea.” He said that the United States Steel Corporation has for 22 years dumped about 15 million gallons of acid a year into the ocean. The Standard Oil Com pany of California has added 45 million gallons of wastes in cluding phenols, “which are deadly and take a long time to disintegrate.” he said. Both companies “are being most cooperative in taking cor rective measures,” the control board chairman said. United States Steel has been given a deadline of April 1 to end dumping in any ocean area that might affect the state; Stand ard's deadline is Dec. 31. In addition, the Oakland Scavenger Company has been ordered to discontinue offshore disposals of wastes from can neries after Nov. 1.

923-> To Them, Two Children Are Fine, but Three Crowd the World

Mrs. Lewis, who is the wife of a pediatrics interne, was one of four leaders of the New York chapter of Zero Population Growth who met yesterday to talk about the relatively new and rapid ly growing population con trol group. Almost 30,000 people in 325 chapters throughout the country have joined ZPG since it was founded early in 1969, she said, and most of them sport the group's button: A black‐and‐white number with the letters “ZPG” sitting on top of what looks like a road map, but is actually a statistical graph. The graph is supposed to symbolize what will happen if the world's population con tinues at its present rate (such a population explosion would have dire consequences, ZPG leaders say), or if there is zero population growth (a stabilized population). “We're not against chil dren or babies at all,” said Peter Decks, a 29‐year‐old investment banker from Tux edo Park, N. Y., who has been active in the New York chapter since it was founded a year ago “We're just against mo?? than two ?? The four leaders sat around a table in the group's drafty, unimpressive headquarters— a portion of an artist's loft on the eighth floor of 722 Broadway. The walls are dec orated with graphs, charts, posters and slogans such as: “Stop at Two,” “Make Love, Not Babies,” “Smaller Fami lies or Bigger Headaches?” and “Anyone Can Have a Baby. A Baby. A Baby. A Baby. A Baby. Is It Worth Re peating?” “What we're saying is that if people stop at two now, the population will stabilize by the year 2015,” said Judy Senderowitz, 28, chairman of the ??0‐member New York chapter, who works at head quarters full‐time without pay. (Surveys show that most couples want three or more children.) “Even if we continue at our present 1 per cent growth rate, which demographers say is the lowest since the De pression,” she added, “our population will still double in 65 years. And that means we will have to double our schools, hospitals, fire de partments and social serv ices.” Probably nothing makes ZPG people angrier than to see pictures of large families in advertisements or newspa per and magazine articles. When this happens, ZPG'ers fire off irate letters to the advertising agencies and the publications. No Difference “It doesn't make any dif ference whether the family can support all those children or not,” said Bonnie Kirk patrick, 29, of Manhattan, who has been advocating population control ever since her days at Mount Holyoke, where she and Miss Sender owitz were classmates. “The fact is,” she added, “the society, the world, and the environment can't sup port them. The open spaces will gradually diminish, and so will the food and water supply. And I'd hate to think about all the pollution.” ZPG was the brainchild of Richard Bowers, a lawyer from Old Mystic, Conn. It has been especially strong on college campuses and on the West Coast, where Dr. Paul Ehrlich, an entomologist at Stanford University and the author of “The Population Bomb,” is one of its leading advocates. Although the ZPG people call their group “the only activist population control movement,” about as radical as they've gotten so far is to picket for the repeal of laws restricting contraception, sterilization and abortion. (The New York chapter refers women seeking abor tions to the Women's Medical Center, 80 Irving Place.) Supplying Speakers Most of their activities are educational and political, such as supplying speakers to groups that want them, passing out leaflets on street corners, participating in ecological fairs, and support ing tax laws that discourage large families. Mrs. Lewis and Mr. Deeks, the two married members of the group that met yesterday, are childless, but said they and their spouses planned to have “two children and no more.” Then if they want more, they plan to adopt— another ZPG position. ZPG is a nonprofit, volun teer organization that is fi nanced largely by contribu tions from members. Mem bership for one year costs $10. More information can be obtained by writing to the New York chapter at Box 259, Village Station, New York City, 10014. ZPG has not been popular with everyone. Two angry men recently tipped over a table containing ZPG educa tional material that had been set up in front of the Museum of Natural History. There has also been opposi tion from those who, for re ligious reasons, are against any interference with human reproduction. “Some people feel very of fended,” Miss Senderowitz said. “They think we're in vading into private territory. They feel that nobody has the right to talk about how many kids other people should have.” Mr. Deeks nodded. “We're confronted with thinking that evolved hundreds of years ago, when the only way a man could survive was if he had 10 children to help him do the work,” he said. “Trying to change some people's thinking is like say ing motherhood and apple ??ie are not American.”

924-> For Students, New York Is a Winter Festival
Judy, a 21‐year‐old senior at the University of Illinois, spent New Year's Eve snug gled under a blanket on the driver seat of a horse‐drawn cab. Her date, Chris Blake, a student at the New School for Social Research who earns $40 a night driving the carriage, took her along on his rounds of Central Park. They took nips of Irish whisky and occasionally ducked into the Plaza Hotel lobby for warmth. When the hour of mid night came, their carriage was carrying them through the park. “It was magical,” Judy said later after a 4 A.M. din ner in Chinatown. For a brief period, be tween Christmas and the first few days of the new year, New York City is expropri ated by college students on vacation. Many left yester day to return to campus and many others still had vaca tion time and remained in the city. They walk through the parks. They wander the streets, window ‐ shopping. They flock to the museums, clog the libraries, fill the bars and pack the movie houses. They sleep a little longer, walk a little slower, laugh a little louder and go to bed much later than almost any one else. Their celebrations, sometimes tinged with the guilt of not studying, make the city more vibrant and more noisy. In the stores, it is the time for “stocking up,” the be ginning of the process of dissemination by which fad and fashion reach the dis tant campuses of Iowa, Ne braska, North Carolina. The purchases this year seem to indicate a new, sub dued mood. In the fancy Fifth Avenue stores, young women in blue jeans buy dresses that almost reach the floor. In Sam Goody's, the popular records are “Jesus Christ Superstar,” the rock opera, and the soft guitar and lyrical love ballads of James Taylor and Elton John. In the bars, even in the macrobiotic restaurants, there is more talk of foot ball than politics. Those in the “head” shops to buy candles shaped like peace symbols, hash pipes and post ers of a grinning Santa Claus smoking marijuana appear to be mostly high school stu dents. Few college students seemed to venture into the depths of the East Village. A couple turned around at St. Marks Place and decided to stroll down Bleecker Street instead, with one of them saying, “It's too hard around here now—it's fright ening.” The New York students who desert the city to go skiing in Vermont or sun bathing in Florida are made up for by the out‐of‐town ers. Some come in for the day, like Chuck O'Neil, a Rutgers student who took four friends to the Johnny Carson tele vision show and spent more than an hour looking for a parking space. Susan Kahn, an Ohio State University sophomore, was dragged to the Museum of Modern Art by her class mate from Long Island to admire two favorite paint ings. Some of the newcomers find the city appalling. “It's just too hectic,” said Mary Troutman, a long‐scarfed freshman at Jacksonville (Fla.) University, as she grabbed her boyfriend's arm and ducked from a flight of pigeons in Bryant Park. “This morning we saw a guy stealing a mirror off a car and everyone just watched him.” Others, like Dan Dossek, a freshman at Boston Univer sity, find it exotic. “You never see something like this back home,” he said as he prepared to snap a photo graph of a three‐man wash tub band singing outside the Hallmark Card store on Fifth Avenue. “We saw the one on Den mark, let's see Sweden,” cracked Bill Zwicker, a Har vard senior, under a marquee reading “Sexual Practices in Sweden,” The four students with him laughed, but the two prostitutes on either side of the theater didn't crack a smile. As always, movies were the great student pastime. This year, the one to see ap peared to be “Love Story.” “Never saw anything like it,” said Harold Graff, a man ager at Loews State I, look ing at the long line of young sters that snaked down Broadway and around the corner and halfway down 46th Street. The line reached almost to the storefront office of Variety, which displayed a blown‐up headline that read “Can Film Biz Afford Suc cess?” The film is about a spunky brunette who dies and an upper‐class young man who wants to break with his fa ther. It strikes a chord of sentimentally that seems to be out of keeping with a gen eration that is also flocking to see “Gimme Shelter,” the documentary film of the Roll ing Stones concert at Alta mont, Calif. “‘Love Story’ is not about people who are out of touch,” said Nancy Forman, who at tends Tufts and dates a Har vard man. “It's about our own little silent majority,” offered another ticketholder. Some students preferred to make movies of their own. Eighteen‐year‐old Joseph Lon go, who attends Essex County College, stopped in front of every pornography shop on Broadway to point his 8‐mm, camera at displays of beck oning flesh, while his parents walked a few paces ahead. “I'm going to show how Times Square is getting out of hand, and depict the de generacy of our era,” he said. “It's going to be called ‘Mon do Porno.” With a whoop, Peter Mur phy kicked a tin can that skidded across the sidewalk and struck the fender of a parked Chevrolet. His two companions laughed appreci atively but with a hint of nervousness. The three walked into the nearest bar, Allen's, on Third Avenue. With his hand wrapped around a large, somewhat steadying stein of beer, Peter explained they had spent a long night of drinking at es tablishments whose names he could no longer recall. Peter has red hair, wears his glasses tilted at a jaunty angle, majors in political science at Washington and Jefferson College (“a hole”), lives in New Canaan, Conn., and says he plays a wicked game of squash. He is one of a number of College students who, while their contemporaries have turned to other chemical sub stances to alter perception, still believe in “bar‐hopping” (if it's a good time) or “bar crawling” (if it's bad). Bars frequented by college crowds are as changeable as the top‐10 record surveys, but generalizations emerge. For Columbia students, there is still Upper Broadway; for Brooklyn and Queens resi dents, the string of First Avenue bars; for suburban ites, Greenwich Village or the Upper East Side. Bars currently shined upon, or recently so, include the Autopub, the Ninth Circle, Mike Malkans (for Sunday brunch), Malachy's (anytime), Churchill's, the Hippopota mus, Dionysos, and, for the hip, St. Adrian Company. “You know why college kids drink?” asked Peter Murphy, attempting to stuff in his shirttails. “You wanna know? Every college kid's a big‐shot. So he's gotta come to New York so he can prove he's a drinker, a smoothy.” Moments later he attempted to pick up a glass, missed it, and broke it. For those who remember that a vacation is usually fol lowed by exams, it is a time to catch up on work. “I call it the term‐paper fever,” said Miss Katherine O'Brien, chief of the new mid‐Manhattan library on 40th Street, which was opened to siphon off the col lege crowd from the main library across the street. On busy days last week, the new library's attendance was more than 3,000. Although the facilities were geared for students, some had not heard of the new branch and trudged up the steps to the main library, past the two lions whose dignity appeared ruffled by the Christmas wreathes around their necks. It was not a time for study or play for everyone. On the Avenue of the Americas re cently, a boy and a girl stood fixed in a long embrace. Fi nally she broke away, weep ing, and walked abruptly down the avenue. The boy waved but she did not turn to see him. As he walked down 46th Street, to ward the line for “Love Story,” he explained that they had been dating at col lege for two years. He had come to the decision that he needed his freedom. “I have to find out things, what I want and who I am,” he said.

927-> Screen: Many Lives of 'The Ski Bum':Work by Bruce Clark Begins Local Run Joseph Mell Plays the Ubiquitous Burt Stone
Bruce Clark's "The Ski Bum" ought to have something besides a movie review. It ought to have something on the model of those book-review ads, compulsively readable, that promote a certain kind of unfashionably popular fiction just by listing the lives and loves of the characters.For example: BURT STONE—his money could buy him a mountain, but not the heart of his wife LIZ. Rich and restless, she hardly noticed that her daughter LISA already had the thoughts and the needs of a woman. But SAMANTHA noticed. Swinging hostess of Newday, Colorado's plushest ski resort, she kept a secret, but could she keep peace between Burt Stone and JOHNNY—The Ski Bum, who loved the freedom of the slopes, but wanted Samantha even more than he wanted to be free . . .And so on through a cast of dozens. Samantha's secret, by the way, is a Chinese husband named Otto, who works for Burt Stone, like everybody else in the movie—which takes us into the story, which is a mistake. For "The Ski Bum," it is much more fun to say who's in it than to tell what's going on.Often you can't really tell what's going on because of a penchant of the filmmakers for starting and stopping each sequence in the middle, without much thought for a beginning or an end. But it is an action of some importance, ultimately stranding Johnny in a lonely phone booth half way up the ski lift in the midst of a raging snowstorm. He has been trying without luck to make a date with Samantha, and his final situation, according to the distributor's plot synopsis (in many ways, better than the movie) is "quietly symbolic of the emotional insularity of Western man today."Almost everybody in "The Ski Bum" is first rate, much too good for the material, with special honors to Joseph Mell as the ubiquitous Burt Stone and Lori Shelle as his emotionally mature daughter. The only performance I didn't like was that of Zalman King, who plays his snow-bound Ski Bum as if he were searching for a viable relation between Hamlet and the Little Match Girl. The CastTHE SKI BUM, directed by Bruce Clark; written by Marc Siegler and Mr. Clark, suggested by the novel by Romain Gary; director of photography, Vilmos Zsigmond; edited by Misha Norland and Mr. Clark; music by Joseph Byrd; produced by David R.

928-> Beauty Of Upsate County Hides Poverty of Its Residents
KEENE, N. Y. — Roland Smith, who lives in an area beautiful enough to attract visitors from around the world, exists in the kind of poverty that most people as sociate with city slums. A construction worker, Mr. Smith, supports himself and his five children on summer earnings —“about $4,000 if the weather holds up”—and on the $75 unemployment checks he receives weekly throughout the six months of winter, when temperatures frequently reach 40 degrees below zero. Although, he spends $15 a week on wood and kerosene, his two‐story tarpaper house is seldom warmer than 45 degrees until his children re turn from school, when he puts wood into a second iron stove and lights the kerosene burner. “But by summer,” says the rangy widower of 55, “I hope to make things easier for us. I plan to put in a [indoor] toilet and fix that water pump. We didn't have no runnin' water again this winter.” Here in Essex County, as in the rural counties of northern Michigan or of northeastern Vermont, cases like Roland Smith's are not uncommon. Essex County, which lies entirely within the Adiron dack State Park near the northern reaches of New York State and has a popula tion more than 99 per cent white, has an unemployment rate of 12.4 per cent, highest in the state. According to officials of the local antipoverty pro gram, the total annual in come of three out of every eight county families is $2, 000 to $4,000. One family in eight has an income below $2,000. Chiseled out of the moun tains and bisecting the coun ty lies the Northway, Inter state 87, which won the “Na tion's Most Scenic Highway” award in 1967. But none of the area's 18 towns has any public trans portation, and a car remains a necessity in a county that extends from Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain in the south to Jay and Chesterfield, more than 50 miles to the north, and that has had little more than 34,000 residents for the last 10 years. James Dezalia, chairman of the county's Board of Supervisors, can sum up the reasons for poverty here in two words: geography and climate. “Industry won't move up here because we're almost 300 miles away from the big markets of New York or Boston,” he explains. “Tour ism is our biggest dollar pro ducer. But the season only lasts from June to Labor Day.” The nation's business re cession has also taken its toll and has all but wiped out the smaller industries of the county, causing the num ber of families on welfare to rise fiat 518 in 1968 to 754 currently, according to coun ty social service administra tors. “We just kept getting out bid by the big ompanies,” said Jack flowery, president of the paper mill in Jay, ex plaining the closing of the mill several weeks ago. The closing left more than one out of four workers unem ployed in the rural commu nity of 2,300. For Harlan Santo, a 25‐ year worker in the mill and one of the few county resi dents who had been able to bring home $90 a week to his family of six, pressures will now begreater. But like many natives of the region, the stocky mill hand exhibits the strong sense of self‐reliance that the long, harsh winters and genera tions of spartan living seem to foster. Discounting warnings of mercury contamination that kept most ice‐fishermen away from Lake champlain this winter, Mr. Santo has already caught more than 100 perch since his job ended. He says “this'll just about pull us through until the unemploy ment checks start comin in next month.” By that time, too, the scarlet tanagers, blue lays, starlings and bluebirds, part ridges and pheasants will once again be luring down state tourists back to the “north country.” “I can't see why more peo ple don't come up here,” says B. J. Cook, the solemn but articulate supervisor of Wilmington, the town that Santa's Workshop and the Whiteface Mountain Ski Cen ter have anchored to the map. “In the fall,” he says, arms opened wide, “you can go up oh the mountain and look at the trees all day and never see the same color twice.” But More people are com ing, with total receipts up 15 pe cent to 22 per cent over last year's, according to business officials from both the Whiteface Mountain Ski Center and the larger re sort town of Lake Placid. Lake Placid, its streets dot ted with gaily painted import and specialty shops and known as the home of the 1969 world bobsled competi tion on Mount Van Hoeven berg, is the goal of hundreds of Ahousands of tourists who each year frequent its luxury hotels and dine in the old American elegance of the Whiteface Inn or the Steak and Stinger restaurant. But most local people here know the luxury hotels and restaurants only as waiters, waitresses, and kitchen help. Lacking the protection of un ions and competing in a labor market flooded with college students during the summer, most employes in the tourist industry can com mand only the minimum wage. “And how much can you earn anyway at miaimum wage for 20 weeks a year,” asks Alice Beeckel, who, be fore joining the staff of the county antipoverty program, of which she is now execu tive director, supported her self and her daughter on the $2,900 she earned annually as a clerk at the Lake Placid Olympic Arena. The antipoverty program, known as the Committee for Economic Improvement of Essex County or simply as C.E.I., administers five Fed erally funded programs op erating throughout the area. Among facilities are 13 “Community Action Centers,” Neighborhood Youth Pro grams, Head Start centers and emergency food and med ical programs. With a total budget approaching half a million dollars and with a permanent staff of 45, the committee is the single larg est force working to solve the problems of the county's poor. Of all the committee's pro grams Head Start appears to be enjoying the most success. According to program offi cials, emphasis has been on the “physical needs of the children.” The program has been most successful in alert ing parents to the symptoms and causes of the numerous respiratory, dental, mid diet related disorders that usually go unnoticed here. Physicians and poverty workers talk of a “malnutri tion of ignorance and neg lect” rather than of poverty, of mismanaged funds buying “soft drinks and cookies in stead of eggs and chuck,” and of misinformation keep ing many from applying for Federal and state benefits for which they are qualified. While efforts such as Head Start and Medicaid are cru cial for the long‐range de velopment of the county, most local officials are utiliz ing whatever influence and tax‐exempting powers they have in attempts to attract year‐round industry. But so far their efforts are bearing little fruit. Jack Howery, president of the paper mill in Jay, speaks for many others when he says that only the Federal Government has the resourc es that could extricate this rural county from the eco nomic and social stagnation that beset it. “Otherwise,” he adds, “this is the next Appalachia.”

929-> News Analysis
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8—The endorsement of Senator Edmund S. Muskie by two of California's most prominent Democrats this morning may signal the beginning of a new stage in the contest for the 1972 Democratic Presidential nomination. For Mr. Muskie, capturing the support of Senator John V. Tunney and Robert Moretti, Speaker of the California Assembly, provides not “sure” votes but a badly needed injection of political adrenalin a month before he announces his candidacy on a national television broadcast next Jan. 4. Perhaps more important, the endorsements will prove to all but the most resolutely skeptical that Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts has no intention of entering any of next year's primaries — although his name will probably be listed on the ballot for the Oregon election whether he wants it there or not. With the apparent elimination of Mr. Kennedy from the primary sweepstakes, Mr. Muskie's strongest challenger would appear to be Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, who has been moving aggressively in Florida, California, Texas, Minnesota and several other states and intends to broaden his efforts next month. In the Gallup poll published Monday, testing sentiment among rank‐and‐file Democrats, Mr. Humphrey showed the largest gain of all the candidates over the last three months, a pickup of six percentage points, from 13 per cent to 19. But it will almost certainly be easier for Mr. Muskie in the weeks ahead to win further endorsements from potent politicians who have been hesitating, including Gov. John J. Gilligan of Ohio, with whom Mr. Tunney is to meet in Los Angeles. In California itself, for example, the senior Senator, Alan Cranston, may soon abandon his earlier inclination toward neutrality to back Mr. Muskie, and Mr. Moretti hopes to produce statements of support from at least half the Assembly's members on Dec. 17. It will almost certainly be easier, furthermore, for Mr. Muskie to raise money in states where he has been having trouble, notably California and Pennsylvania, where many contributors have been waiting for Senator Kennedy. Several weeks ago, Mr. Muskie took Mr. Moretti by the arm, made a pitch for support and told the young legislator: “If you come with me, it will open billfolds all over the country. I've had people in St. Louis tell me they wanted to know what you were doing before they committed.” That, no doubt, was an exaggeration, the kind of flattery that flows from candidates like oil from a gusher. But it contained a nugget of truth: Politicians and money men across the country have been wondering for weeks whether the Maine Senator could show real power in one of the nation's major states. Mr. Muskie still faces serious problems, to be sure. He is vulnerable to an upset by Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington, Senator Humphrey or Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama in the crucial Florida primary. He continues to generate little real passion among party professionals. He has irritated some old‐guard leaders, particularly in the South, with his increasingly liberal policy statements. But Mr. Muskie has gained much‐needed momentum, and it is likely that less will be heard in the months, ahead about his problems and a good deal more about his assets. It is hardest to be a frontrunner before the primary season has got under way. “We have been following strategy,” Mr. Muskie said, “designed to put us in the strongest possible position at the beginning of 1972.” Few politicians think that Mr. Muskie has done as well as he might have; but most would agree with a comment made, today by a supporter of a rival: “The nomination is still his to win or lose, and the Tunney thing helps.” One reason it does is Mr. Tunney's close relationship with Senator Kennedy, who was his roommate at the University of Virginia Law School and is, as Senator Tunney said today, “still my closest personal friend.” Mr. Tunney was pressed at the news conference to say whether he would switch to Mr. Kennedy if the latter became an active candidate. Mr. Tunney said his endorsement was “unqualified” and added with some heat: “The fact that I am here saying that I want Senator Muskie to be elected President indicates that I take Senator Kennedy at his word that he will not become a candidate.” Both Mr. Tunney and Mr. Moretti, upon whom Mr Muskie said he would “lean heavily” in California and elsewhere, have in fact been told by Mr. Kennedy in recent days that if they wanted to play roles In 1972 Presidential politics they would be ill‐advised to hold out for him. Other politicians will get the message, despite a Gallup poll, released today, showing Mr. Kennedy trailing President Nixon by only three percentage points, 44 to 41, and a Sepia magazine survey showing Mr. Kennedy with 30 per cent support among blacks, with Mr. Humphrey second, Mayor Lindsay of New York third and Mr. Muskies fourth with only 7 per cent. One question, however, remains: If Mr. Muskie is unable to lock things up, is not a convention deadlock probable? And is not Mr. Kennedy then likely to emerge as the nominee? If the polls show him far ahead, it could well happen, in the view of many politicians. But some analysts have come to believe in recent weeks that a deadlock is improbable. They argue that without the two‐thirds rule repealed by the Democrats in 1936, a deadlock could come into being only if there were three or more candidates with substantial blocs of votes, all short of a majority, at the convention—and only if they were mutually hostile on either ideological or personal grounds. Barring considerable change in the tone of the campaign, such hostilities are not in prospect for Miami Beach. It appears possible, at least, that Humphrey votes would go to Mr. Muskie, or vice versa, and that Lindsay votes would go to Senator George McGovern, or vice versa, rather than joining in a sudden mass defection to Senator Kennedy.

931-> 28 KILLED IN CRASH OF AIRLINER IN SOFIA
SOFIA, Bulgaria, Dec. 22 (UPI)—At least 28 persons were killed last night in the crash of a Bulgarian airliner shortly after take ‐off from Sofia Airport on a flight to Algeria, the Bulgarian Government announced today. It was the fifth major crash involving an East European airline this year. The plane, a Soviet‐built Ilyushin‐16 turboprop, was carrying 62 passengers—all Bulgarian entertainers—on the way to New Year holiday engagements in Algeria, and 11 crew members. In addition to those killed, many were hurt, although the exact number was not given. Airport officials said the plane had just taken off for Algiers at 11:30 P.M. when it nosed over and crashed. Airport workers got most of the passengers out before the plane caught fire, the officials said. Two hundred and four persons were killed in four previous crashes involving East European airlines this year. All use Russian‐made aircraft.

932-> ‘Hot Line’ Carries Immediate Help In Emergencies
What powerboat owner hasn't at one time or another found himself miles from a friendly marina, in the hands of a strange boat repair yard and with nobody capable of diagnosing the cause of his craft's breakdown? Worse yet, doesn't such a happening always seem to occur at night or on a holi day weekend? One manufacturer is taking the first steps toward reduc ing the frustration such a situation causes. Test Concorde of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has an nounced the inauguration of an emergency “hot line” pro gram which would provide Concorde yacht owners pro fessional help by telephone whenever and wherever they experience difficulty. According to Donald J. Gorman, executive vice pres ident: “Test Concorde has found that most breakdowns can be easily repaired with simple instructions from one who is thoroughly familiar with the equipment involved. Our service representatives regularly get a customer un der way with a few simple in structions over the tele phone.” The hot line will work like this: Owners of 47‐foot Con corde motor yachts and sport fishermen will be given an unlisted number to call if, at any time, they experience difficulty with their craft and have no knowledgeable serv ice help available. On the other end of the line will he an answering service, which, within minutes, will relay their distress signals to a service specialist on duty. He will call the cus tomer back, and using a check‐off sheet designed es pecially for emergencies, will familiarize the boat owner or mechanic with the steps to be taken. According to Concorde, in 75 per cent of the break downs, a hose tightened, a valve opened or closed, a screw made more secure, or any one of a hundred minor adjustments which could be made under the direction of a service specialist will get the boat owner on his way again in minutes. “This is the first time a program of this sort has been attempted in the industry,” says Gorman. “We are offer ing it to our 47‐foot owners exclusively at first because we want a track record of ac complishment before opening it up to all models. “Besides, the big boats are much more complicated pieces of equipment and the average marine repair yard might be unfamiliar with all their working parts.”

933-> U.S. BUSINESS ROUNDUP
Consumer interests, which are now pressing for reforms on a wide front, have been taking a close look in some states at revolving credit plans offered by department stores or various credit‐card operations. Beyond legislative efforts there have been a number of court cases wherein plain tiffs have filed suit against certain revolving credit plans on the ground that the effective interest rates vio late state statutes on usury. Several courts have upheld plaintiffs, but some major department store chains and others have appealed lower court rulings. Just last week the Ala bama Labor Council filed class action against six large Alabama banks charging that their effective credit‐card in terest rates exceed the state's maximum level of 8 per cent. Meanwhile, the question is raised about the impact of adverse court rulings. There are indications that some sup pliers of consumer credit have reduced their merchan dising of consumer‐credit plans. Litigation, arisen in such states as … The first court action on revolving credit in Wiscon sin arose in 1968 when the state acted against the J. C. Penney Company. An injunc tion was sought against the retailer's charging 1½ per cent per month on the de clining balance of its revolv ing charge accounts. This figured out to be 6 percent age points a year more than the state's usury law allows. In 1970 the Wisconsin Su preme Court upheld lower court rulings declaring this practice illegal. As the case worked its way through the courts, Penney's position was explained this way: “Its monthly charge is time‐price differential and not subject to the state's in terest rate statutes because when it sells merchandise under its revolving charge account plan it charges a higher sale price than the price at which it is willing to sell the merchandise for cash.” At the state Supreme Court level there was no hesitancy in issuing an in junction against stores charging the 1½ per cent monthly interest rate. The lower court ruling de clined to enjoin the depart ment store chain on the ground that even though it was an illegal rate it consti tuted “a private matter” be tween the customer and the store. The state Supreme Court, on the other hand, held: “We take judicial notice of the widespread use of the re volving charge accounts and of the large number of ‘Wis consin citizens affected by these practices. We have no hesitancy in endorsing an in junction against the usurious practices which clearly con stitute a public nuisance here and should be discon tinued.” For its part, Penney con tended that the 1½ per cent per month on the unpaid balance of a customer's bill was not entirely interest but part of a “service charge” for handling, mailing and other expenses. “When a cus tomer,” the store noted in its court brief, “refuses to pay monthly service charges [the store] has not made any at tempt to collect such month ly charges.” State Attorney General Bronson LaFollette, who be gan the court action, stressed throughout the liti gation that “no inference should be drawn that Pen ney's plan is any more cul pable than its competitors.” After the Supreme Court ruling a number of individu als and consumer groups moved to recover what they termed excess interest they had paid. Meanwhile, Wisconsin stores have abandoned rates that work out to be in excess of 12 per cent annually. The Legislature has before it a bill that would exempt retail merchants from liabili ties for damages sought by customers who have paid usurious rates. Some consum er groups have noted that a two‐year statute of limita tions may apply to recovery efforts and labeled the pro posed bill “a stall.” Says Robert Ehmann, gen eral manager of the Harry S. Manchester store in Mad ison: The liability for those stores which charged 1½ per cent is simply fantastic. If everyone filed for recov ery it could bankrupt all the stores in the state that are liable.” In his view, the court rul ing has produced a change in the availability of credit. “Certainly the customer is going to lose a lot of credit convenience as a result of that ruling,” he says. “We'll have to reduce. Indeed we already have. Credit just won't be tailored as much to the needs of the custo mers as it was before. There will be fewer plans and they will be more cut and dried.” Last month the Fountain Circuit Court in Indiana up held a suit filed by a young Covington lawyer, Ward S. Williams, in which he al leged that the interest rates charged by the Standard Oil Company (Indiana) to its credit‐card holders violated the state's usury laws. The court held that “the defendants’ revolving charge account agreement, although not a loan per se, is in sub stance a credit transaction and a contractual forebear ance of a debt which is due and payable and falls with in the meaning of the In diana law regulating inter est and usury.” The court also held that the “finance charge” pro vided for in said revolving charge‐account agreement is in substance interest and subject to the Indiana stat utes regulating the collection of interest and defining usury, and that the amount of interest higher than 8 per cent per annum is usurious, and that the plaintiff and his class are entitled to recoup the same from the defend ants.” This suit is one of three filed by Mr. Williams and so far is the only one tried. Standard Oil is appealing and has until mid‐September to file briefs. The lower court noted that a Uniform Consumer Credit Code, enacted earlier this year by the Indiana General Assembly, was not in effect in the 1969–70 period cov ered by Mr. Williams's suit. In effect the new code re peals the state's usury law. It preserves the 18 per cent revolving credit charge and includes a standard‐of‐living escalator clause that seems to favor lenders. The new maximum rates are 36 per cent annually on loan bal ances under $300; 21 per cent per annum for balances between $300 and $1,000, and 15 per cent for balances in excess of $1,000 or 18 per cent over‐all, whichever is greater. There was little opposition in the General Assembly to this measure and business and credit men in Indiana report little impact from the lower court's ruling in Mr. Williams's suit. Says Charles VanNuys, executive vice president of the Indiana Re tail Council, of the Williams decision: “We aren't worry ing about it. We don't have any reaction on the damn thing one way or the other.” Sears, Roebuck & Co. was named in a revolving credit suit filed in Connecticut that held that the effective 18 per cent per annum interest rate violated state statutes. Com mon Pleas Court Judge Simon S. Cohen upheld plaintiff Justin J. Donnelly Sr. in a ruling last December. Judge Cohen, whose ruling is being appealed, has de clared, in part: “The business community has assumed that the silent public, the consumer, will ab sorb whatever additional cost of credit is imposed upon it whether authorized by agree ment or not. Ethical con siderations aside, the service charge, finance charge or by whatever other name it is called imposes upon the pur chaser an illegal burden sanc tioned by no law, no admin istrative regulation delegated by statute, by the bank com missioner or any other state regulatory agency… The ex ploitation of the buying pub lic has been gradual and the corporate and financial insti tutions have been speedy in spiraling the cost of credit with and without the con sumer's consent.” Last April Judge Otis God frey Jr. ruled in Ramsey County District Court that Montgomery Ward & Co.'s 18 per cent and more inter est on its revolving charge accounts violated the states 8 per cent limit on interest. Ward argued that the 1½ per cent monthly charge was not to be construed as an in terest rate but that such re volving charge accounts are, in fact, time‐price sales. Ward is appealing the de cision, which was hailed by David K Roe, president of the State A.F.L.‐C.I.0 as “a major accomplishment for the consumer.” Three weeks after the court decision Dayton's De partment Stores, the largest chain in Minnesota, an nounced it would take on no new revolving charge custo mers and even earlier Gam ble‐Skogmo advised custom ers that it was closing down its revolving charge operations. The picture has changed somewhat recently with the signing by Gov. Wendell An derson of legislation that raises the usury limit from 8 to 12 per cent a year. The new law took effect Aug. 1. Dayton's has begun en rolling new revolving credit customers at a rate of 1 per cent a month instead of 1½ per cent. In setting the 12 per cent rate, the Legislature spurned efforts by liberals to keep it at 8 per cent and applicable to revolving charges as well as other loans, and by the retailers who sought an in crease to 18 per cent. “Due to the climate of the Legis lature,” says W. John Ber tram, president of the Min nesota Retail Federation, “it was obviously the best we could get. We'll live with it for two years and try to have it replaced in 1973.” The J. C. Penney Company is also named in a citizen's suit in South Dakota that alleges that the store's 1½ per cent revolving credit interest charge is in violation of the state's usury law. A circuit court in Sioux Falls has ruled that the 18 per cent rate being collebted by the Pen ney company was above the state's legal limit and repre sented usury. South Dakota's attorney general, Gordon Mydland, says the Penney company is appealing the lower court ruling to the state Supreme Court with a deadline for fil ing briefs still ahead and no certain schedule for oral ar guments to be heard next month. Meantime, South Dakota department stores and other businesses encourag ing charge accounts report a rising volume in trade based on the use of credit cards. Ray Quarles, manager of one of the largest Penney stores in the state, in Aberdeen, says the store's credit busi ness is increasing steadily despite the lawsuit. Mr. Quarles adds that in rural states like South Da kota the amount of credit business in Penney stores is not as great as in industrial centers but even so it is showing a steady increase. Credit association officials, bankers and other store man agers indicated there is no discernible attempt to back away from credit cards and the extension of credit.

936-> OUSTER OF NEWSMEN BY U.N. IS PROTESTED
CHARLOTTE, N. C., Dec. 22 (AP) — The president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, in a telegram to Secretary General Thant, has protested the withdrawal of the accreditation of two Chinese Nationalist correspondents at the United Nations.Charlotte Observer, said that if Mr. Thant's decision was allowed to stand, it would mean that “he or his successors can oust any correspondent of any nonmember state in political disagreement with any member state.” C. A. McKnight, editor of The Charlotte Observer, said that if Mr. Thant's decision was allowed to stand, it would mean that "he or his successors can oust any correspondent of any nonmember state in political disagreement with any member state." The correspondents, Chen‐chi Lin and T. C. Tang, were ousted last Friday at the request of Communist China. Mr. Thant said that as employes of the Government‐owned Central News Agency of Nationalist China, they were subject: to the expulsion resolution passed by the General Assembly in October. “This grave and misguided action is in violation of the entire tradition of the coverage of the United Nations,” Mr. McKnight said. “Ever since the founding of the United Nations, there have been correspondents there from countries and movements not represented in the organization.”

937-> Bonuses Are Allowed If Pattern Has Existed
WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 (AP)—Most Christmas yearend bonuses will not be covered by the wage and salary guidelines if the employer has given the bonuses previously, the Internal Revenue Service said today. The agency said bonuses paid after Nov. 13 would not be calculated as part of the permissable 5.5 per cent annual increase if the employer had an established written plan in effect before Nov. 14 providing for a definite amount or a method or formula for the computation of the amount. The same would be true if the employer had an established pattern of providing bonuses in two of the three fiscal years ending before Nov. 14. Using any of the last three fiscal years as a base, the total bonuses may not exceed the total paid during the base period plus 5.5 per cent. For bonuses exceeding this, the excessive payment must be included in the general wage and salary standard.

938-> The Nation
HARTFORD — If something less important than the finan cial well being of the state of Connecticut had been at stake, it might have been funny. But as the “Great Tax Debate of 1971” fumbled along last week, each development seemed more tragic. In a period of national re cession, with a soaring unem ployment rate, the state faces a deficit of more than $260‐mil lion. The solution, passed re luctantly by both houses of the Legislature last month, was to be an income tax, the first in the state's history. The politi cians, up to and including Gov. Thomas J. Meskill, had expected that the new tax would stir pub lic ire even though economists heralded it as being more equit able than the main alternative —an increased sales tax. But few were ready for the explosion of public protest that met the income tax and forced the General Assembly into special session to consider repeal. Thus the stage was set for the farce last week when, as they had over the past seven months, the political leaders of the state opted not to lead and, instead, practiced the fine art of decep tion. In the latest stages of the tax debate, both the Republican Governor and the Democrats who control the General Assem bly did almost the opposite of what they told the public they were doing. Both called stentori ously for repeal, all the while working—directly or indirectly —to retain the income tax. Thus, by the end of the week the situation looked like this: The Democrats in the General Assembly had pushed through repeal of the income tax and re placed it with the highest state sales tax in the nation‐6.5 per cent. The bill now lay on Gover nor Meskill's desk while he pon dered whether to sign it or veto it and leave on the books the income tax of 1 to 6 per cent. As a hedge while he considered the options, he directed the state tax director to prepare means of collecting both taxes. Mr. Meskill wanted the in come tax because without it he could look forward to a series of other tax increases before he stood for re‐election in 1974; even with the tax hike he might not be able to put the state in the black as he had promised during the 1970 campaign. He wanted the income tax en acted this year, hoping that four years’ time would soften the public memory of the initial pain and prove the wisdom of the tax. To get his way, in the latest round of maneuvering, Mr. Mes kill went before the General As sembly's special session and called for a sales tax of 7.5 per cent. The proposal was dis missed as ridiculously high and never given serious considera tion, but the Governor refused to adjust it. He also avoided some Democratic leaders who sought him out in trying to de velop other alternatives based on an increased sales tax. Then, after failing in an at tempt to control his fellow Re publicans in the Senate, Mr. Mes kill instructed the Republicans in the General Assembly to try to block any alternatives to the income tax. If the repeal effort collapsed in the General Assem bly, the tax would remain on the books, and, since the Demo crats numerically control the General Assembly, it would ap pear to be their fault. The Democratic position was less consistent. At midweek, some of the Democrats seemed to want to respond to the public outcry with repeal and some form of sales tax. Some others who essentially favored the in come tax nevertheless sided with the repeal forces in order to put the political heat on the Repub lican Governor. A Senator who attended one closed door caucus quoted John M. Bailey, the Democratic state chairman, as having told him and his colleagues: “We know this package will produce a def icit. We also know that we have to present Meskill with an alter native. If he doesn't want to accept this alternative, he'll have to keep the income tax, and it will forevermore be his income tax.” A major problem for the Dem ocratic leaders was that many of their rank and file in the House were supporters of the income tax. And in the early voting, a strange coalition of Democrats and the Governor's Republicans was lined up against repeal. As the repeal question came to a crucial ballot, leaders of both parties scurried about the House “twisting arms,” to bring their members into line and to keep them there. A gasp went up as the tote board flashed re sults: 83 to 82 for repeal. The board showed two Republicans, William J. Smyth and Marilyn Pearson, both income tax foes, had voted with the Democrats. “The gubernatorial eyes are on them,” one party veteran said. After huddling at the back of the hall, Mr. Smyth returned to his seat and changed his vote. Then, on the verge of tears and in a quavering voice, Mrs. Pear son switched too. Now the tally was reversed against repeal. Across the chamber, bunches of Democratic leaders and stanch regulars stood surround ing clusters of income tax sup porters. Several concentrated on Joseph A. Coatsworth, a red haired, 27‐year‐old freshman from Cromwell. “Change it, change it,” several men yelled into Mr. Coatsworth's face. “Change it. You can't hurt your self. This is a party vote. It's party responsibility. Change it.” Mr. Coatsworth locked his jaw, and folded his arms resolutely. He began to perspire. He jammed his hands in his pockets. But he did not crack. “They've been at us all day, since we walked in the door,” Mr. Coatsworth said later. As it turned out, the Demo crats did not need Mr. Coats worth. Two other Assemblymen buckled to the pressure and the repeal forces carried the day. Edgar A. King, a moderate conservative and moralistic Re publican from Farmington who is serving his third term in the House, had watched the pro ceedings with increasing annoy ance. Toward the end of the day he rose, scanned the hall of the House and, in a rage, ex claimed, “I've never seen such a collection of phoney balonies under one roof in my entire life.”

940-> Value Line Names Keystone in a Suit
BOSTON, March 8 (AP)—Arnold Bernhard & Co., Inc., and Value Line Funds of New York filed a $40‐million damage suit today against Keystone Custodian Funds, Inc., and a subsidiary for allegedly failing to provide contracted fiscal and other services for the plaintiff. The suit by Arnold Bernhard & Co., which is the sponsor and manager of Value Line mutual funds and the publisher of various financial services, also seeks $20‐million in punitive damages. The complaint in United States District Court charges that Keystone Custodian Funds and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Investment Companies Services Corporation, failed to service properly the accounts of Value Line funds from April, 1968, to June, 1969. A spokesman for Value Line funds charged that the defendants “failed to provide adequate or sufficient personnel, or to supervise them or to maintain controls over the moneys received and paid out or the shares purchased or liquidated.” Value Line Securities, Inc., was the subject of an administrative action Aug. 22, 1969, by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said the company had failed to keep adequate records and did not disclose this failure in the prospectuses of the funds. The plaintiffs in the suit filed today claimed that Keystone Custodian Funds and its subsidiary concealed their failure and inability to perform work for which they had contracted and that, therefore, the plaintiffs lacked the information to make proper disclosures to their shareholders. Company Replies A spokesman for the Investment Companies Services Corporation said yesterday, regarding the complaint, “It would appear that the suit is a preposterous effort to shift to I.C.S.C. the problems of Value Line's management which resulted in suspension of sales of shares of a Value Line Fund and the posting of substantial security by Mr. Arnold Bernhard to protect that fund's shareholders against loss. The litigation does not involve any of the Keystone Funds.”

941-> Text of Price Unit's Statement on Rents
WASHINGTON, Dec. 22—Following is the text of Price ComMission policy statement, issued today, governing rent increases in the nation: Coverage [1] Jurisdictional standards which delineate additional areas subject to rent control are: [2] Parking lots and spaces which are used in connection with a residence rather than an office or commercial enterprise and for which payment is not on an hourly or daily basis. If the parking space is used by a transient or nonresidential user, the rates will be treated as prices, not rents. [3] Hotel and motel rooms used for residential rather than transient purposes. Rates will be treated as prices for transients. Mobile home park spaces and mobile homes used for residential rather than transient purposes. Rates will be treated as prices for transients. [4] Housing for the elderly which provides a residence, personal and sheltered care. But those proViding nursing service or in‐patient care are not covered under rent regulations. Base Rental Definition The definition of base rental published in the Federal Register of Nov. 13, 1971, will be superseded by a new definition, which will allow an equitable adjustment of rents. The three‐part definition provides a logical basis upon which to determine the base rental through determination on a unit‐by‐unit basis, on an average transaction basis (which replaces the “highest transaction” rule now in the regulations), or by the May 25, 1970, 5 per cent rule. [1] Unit‐by‐unit: If the lease is for a term of a month or less (commonly known as a month‐to‐month or week‐toweek rental), the base rental for an individual unit is the rent permitted for that particular unit during the freeze period beginning Aug. 15 and ending Nov. 13, 1971. If any month‐to‐month leases have been increased above the freeze rent in accordance with previous regulations, they.1hust now be adjusted downward. [2] Average transactions: For leases with terms over one month, the base rent of lease is the average rent (figured on a percentage increase basis) charged within a building or complex for the same or substantially identical rental units in transactions executed with the same specific class of purchaser dun ing the base period. In the absence of a transaction during the base period, the nearest 30‐day period in which there was a transaction will be used up to within the 90 days preceding Aug. 15, 1971. If leases have been signed since the freeze which comply with the “highest transaction” rule but not with the new definition, they shall not be abrogated. [3] May 25, 1970: If there have been no transactions within a 90‐day period preceding the freeze, the base rent is a 5 per cent increase over the rental prevailing for a particular rental unit as of May 25, 1970. Same on Substantially Identical Units The commission has clarified the definition of the same or substantially identical rental units.” Two rules which determine if units are similar are: [1] Units must be substantially identical physically (size, amenities, location) and also have been customarily rented for approximately the same price prior to the freeze; or [2] They are substantially identical in price only. To qualify as nearly similar in price there can be no more than a $2.50 per‐month difference in price above or below the amount of rent in question. Transaction Definition A “transaction” is regarded as a binding contract entered into at a place and point in time. It includes any renewal of existing leases by an incumbent occupant; any signing of a lease by a new occupant; or the implied contract entered into between tenant and landlord upon the payment of monthly rent where the tenant is on a month‐to‐month or week‐toweek basis. However, the monthly payment of rent under a lease whose term is in excess of one month and which prevents the landlord from making rent increases is now considered a transaction. Calculation of Average Transaction on Rent The average transaction price shall be calculated by determining the percentage of increased or decreased rent adjustment for each transaction during the base period in the building or complex. The sum of these percentages is divided by the number of total transactions during the freeze base period in order to arrive at an aver age percentage adjustment (rounded to the nearest percentage). The average percentage adjustment is applied to the rent that prevailed for a rental unit period to adjustment during the base period. Definition of Complex A complex is defined as a group of buildings substantially adjacent which, for purposes of management, are operated as a single entity as of Aug. 15, 1971. Notification of Rent Increases Tenants shall receive written notice at least 30 days before a rent increase goes into effect. The burden of proof for proper notification is on the landlord, who may obtain proof in either of two ways: [1] Send notices by regular mail and sign a notarized affidavit that a specific number of notices were sent to specified tenants at specified addresses on specified dates; or, [2] Hand‐delivered notes may be served and receipts obtained from tenants or their agents. The notifications must contain the citation of the explanation under which the increase is allowed, accom‐, panied by an explanation in laymen's language. Further explanation of the regulation's application to the tenant's increase should con tain: The rent before the increase; the rent after the increase; the percentage of the increase; amount of the increase; the date the increase is effective; the example of the computation of the increase; other information necessary for checking the computation of the increase such as identification of the units involved in the computation, and the dates and amounts of transactions, taxes and municipal charges and how they are prorated, and full descriptions of capital improvement charges and how they are prorated. The tenant may question an increase and has the right to see the landlord's documentation supporting the rent increase. Annual Rent Increment and Pass‐Through When a lease expires under normal circumstances, an annual rent increment up to 2.5 per cent may be added to the base rental in anticipation that operating cost will increase. Although the 2.5 per. cent may take effect even if there is no increase in operating costs, in no case shall the increment be raised higher than 2.5 per cent even if costs are greater. This increment may be applied to month‐to‐month, week‐to‐week, and yearly leases. If there are increases in ‘state or local property taxes, Government fees and levies, or increases in charges for municipal services (exclusive of gas and electricity), these may be added onto the base rent and the increment increase, but may not be used as a basis upon which to figure the 2.5 per cent increment. Capital Improvements Specific wording on the amount of pass‐through allowed for capital improvements will appear in the regulations to be published in the Federal Register. Rent‐Controlled Housing Rents for units of Government‐assisted housing shall be set by the controlling governmental authority under their existing standards and procedures, subject to monitoring and modification if necessary by the Price Commission. Since college‐owned or controlled student housing is unique in that it may contain elements of seasonality, institutional care, Governmentassisted housing, nonprofit operation, and captive tenancy, none of the normal yardsticks or formulae which are applicable to the normal housing market are applicable to college housing. It has therefore been determined that the status of college housing will be similar to the status of Government‐assisted housing, with the exception of the reporting requirements.

942-> Religion
Vatican II, the council held from 1962 to 1965, grappled with the fundamental ques tion of whether the Roman Catholic Church is essen tially a structure run by a hierarchy or a community revolving around the entire “people of God.” It came down on the latter side and produced a sweeping set of reforms, including a call for greater participation by lay men and priests in the oper ation of the church. Last week, the issue did not seem as settled as it once did. A controversy was swirling in international Catholic circles over a pro posed new “constitution” for the church, and liberal lead ers, such as Leo Cardinal Suenens of Belgium, were openly accusing conserva tives in the Vatican of try ing to roll back the changes of Vatican H. As a result of the flak, Vatican ‘officials have al ready been forced to post pone promulgation of the document…And it seems cer tain to produce new fire works next month, when representatives of the var ious national hierarchies convene in Rome for the Synod of Bishops. At issue is the so‐called “Lex Fundamentalis,” a 10, 000‐word document written in Latin that is intended to spell out the basic nature of the church. The church has never had such a formal “constitu tion,” but at the close of Vatican II Pope Paul VI sug gested to Vatican offi cials that it might, be a good idea to have one. He pre sumably saw it as a way to keep the church's fundamen tal tenets in people's minds during a period of intense unrest and conflict. The constitution is de signed to serve as the in troductory chapter to a full scale revision of church law, a project that is now under way. The document has been under secret preparation since 1966; it first surfaced in May, 1969, when a draft (actually the third) was re leased to numerous ranking bishops. The draft proved to he highly conservative in tone and content. It tended to identify the church with the hierarchy, and placed great emphasis on the authority of the Pope and bishops. Lay men and priests were urged to obey their ecclesiastical superiors, but little refer ence was made to their rights and privileges, espe cially when their views con flicted with those of church authorities. It was also frequently couched in “tri umphalistic” language that did not seem to follow the lead of Vatican H in respect ing the legitimacy of other churches. The document was widely criticized and then sent back to the Pontifical Commission for the Revision of the Code of Canon Law. Several months ago, a new draft emerged and was dispatched to bishops around the world, with an invitation to submit comments to Rome by Sept. 1. The current version, how ever, differs little’ from its predecessor, and in rercent weeks it has drawn a grow ing barrage of criticism from various countries. A group of scholars in Bolo gna, Italy, published a 60‐page critique of the Lex in four languages, and 200 Euro pean theologians issued a statement suggesting that the document disagreed with the Gospels “in essential points.” In this country, a committee of the Canon Law Society produced its own critical evaluation, charging that the constitution would “erode further the diminishing re spect for law and ecclesias tical authority” in the church. The biggest salvo came from Cardinal Suenens, the Belgian primate who emerged as the most pres tigious liberal spokesman in the church two years ago, when he made a series of attacks on Vatican methods of governing the church. In an interview with the Nation al Catholic News Service, he personally criticized Pericle Cardinal Felici, who is in charge of drafting the Lex, and said that its adoption would run the risk of “com pleting blocking all future development.” Conservatives have fought back and argued that such law is integral to the sort of freedom envisioned by Vatican II. Writing in the Paris newspaper Le Monde, Jean Cardinal Danielou, the Jesuit theologian, and papal adviser, defended the Lex on the ground that “the People of God need a charter.” In a sense, the battle go ing on at the highest levels of the church over a theo logical document is a reflec tion of a struggle at the grass‐roots level in the Unit ed States and elsewhere. By and large, pastors of local parishes have em braced the church's new lit urgies, tried to establish parish councils and other wise implemented the pre scribed changes of Vatican II —at least on paper. How ever, many are finding that their parishioners — like many Vatican officials— have not yet embraced the vision of the church as put forward by the council, and in some cases priests and laymen have organized for mal opposition. The debate over the Lex brings into question the com mitment of Vatican leaders to overcome such at titudes through educational programs and other means and to implement the changes of Vatican II. It also raises the question of the staying power of liberal re formers, a problem that has been complicated by the de fection from the active min istry of many liberal priests and some bishops. In the past, momentum in such situations has generally been with conservatives in the Vatican, but the victo ries in the Lexodebate thus far seem to have been going to the liberals. The document, at any rate, is certain to be a major topic of conversation at next month's Synod of Bishops. Some American liberals are encouraged that Cardinal Suenens, who has been cool ing his criticism of the Vat ican for the last year or so, has seized on the Lex as an issue. They hope that the document can become a ral lying point for liberal efforts on the question of priestly celibacy and other issues troubling the church.

MIAMI, March 8 (AP)—16‐year‐old high school sophomore boarded a National Airlines jet today, at Mobile, Ala., drew a pistol and forced the crew to fly him to Miami, where he surrendered peacefully. The youth, Thomas Kelly, Marston, was charged with aircraft piracy and held by Federal marshals at Miami for return to Mobile. The flight, National 475, which originated in Pensacola, Fla., ended almost three hours after the youth boarded the plane at Mobile. Federal agents said he had ordered 38 passengers and four stewardesses off and demanded to be flown to Canada. He changed his mind over Tennessee and allowed the crew to fly him to Miami, the authorities said. The only persons aboard with him were Capt. Robert Carter; the co‐pilot, Jack Graham, and the flight engineer, Jerry Gemma. Captain Carter told newsmen at Miami that the youth had said he wanted to go to Canada because he was getting bad grades and his parents were on his back.

946-> IN THE NATION
WASHINGTON — Back in 1948, I served as a voter registrar in Moore County, N. C. As I recall it, the law required me to have the books open for new registrants at a designated place on three specified Saturdays. Those who wanted to register had to do it on those particular days, at that particu lar place; otherwise, they had to find me and hope that I had the registra tion books on hand. There was no es tablished way for people to find out who the registrar was or where he lived and worked, and the only adver tising of the three Saturday registra tion days was in fine print on the classified ad page of the local weekly. It happened that year that certain political leaders in Moore County were strong for an underdog gubernatorial candidate named W. Kerr Scott, later Governor and Senator, one of the great political figures of my experience. A high‐powered registration campaign was put on, and my three working Saturdays (I was paid $6 a day) were nightmarish, with long lines in front of my desk from dawn to dusk. I don't recall whether Kerr Scott carried Moore County, although he won the state election in a runoff, but that experience first suggested to me that something was badly wrong with the way we organize voting in this country. I was astonished that there were so many voting‐age people who were not registered. It was apparent, moreover, that all most of the new registrants had needed was somebody to tell them where to go and when to do it. Finally, almost everybody in those long lines in front of me was poor and rural, and large numbers of them were black. I know now that in that regard Moore County was all too typical. The sad truth is that the major barrier to voting participation is the maze of state registration requirements that confuse, harass and disenfranchise so many people. And the ultimate shame is that, for both natural and contrived reasons, a huge proportion of those prevented from registering are pre cisely those who most need to be heard—the poor, the black, the dis advantaged. It is also likely that the potential impact of the eighteen‐year‐old voting amendment will be blunted by the same registration restrictions. Statistics tell the story. In 1968, in a voting population of 120 million, only 73 million voted. Richard Nixon received 31 million votes, but half again as many people—47 million— did not vote at all. The chief obstacle was obviously the maze of registration requirements, because of the 82 million Americans who were registered, 89.4 per cent actually voted. And a Census Bureau study shows that of voting‐age persons not voting, 72 per cent had been specifically ruled out by some registration requirement. That same year, analysis shows, 75.4 per cent of the white voting population was registered and 69.1 per cent voted; but only 66.2 per cent of eli gible blacks were registered and only 57.6 per cent voted. At the lowest educational level, 49.6 per cent were registered and 38.4 per cent voted, while at the highest level, 87.9 per cent were registered and 85.'i per cent voted. So it was with family income. At the lowest level, 65.3 per cent were registered and 53.5 per cent voted, compared with 87.8 per cent regis tered and 84.1 per cent voting at the highest level. All national elections follow the same pattern. One reason for it is that the poor and the disadvantaged tend to be uninformed about legal require ments, mistrustful of the law, skeptical about politics and politicians and fre quently nomadic. But another is that registration laws—literacy tests, for example—often have been designed precisely, to exclude them as “unde sirable.” Not only the lower ranks of society suffer exclusion from the electorate, however. Political leaders have long known that it is easier to “control” a small electorate than a large one; hence the history of such devices as the poll tax, now outlawed, and resi dency requirements. This has been partially corrected by a Federal law waiving state residency requirements for Presidential voting. However, Congress has not yet ex tended the waiver to other Federal elections, as several pending bills would do. But what really is needed is a simple, comprehensive, nonparti san national registration system for Federal elections, which the states could then adopt if they chose. One such plan is the so‐called Uni versal Enrollment Plan, which would utilize a mass of federally trained and supervised volunteers to conduct na tionwide door‐to‐door registration can vasses. Senator Edward Kennedy has proposed a free postcard method and a national computer registration sys tem in the Census Bureau. Senator Hubert Humphrey advocates distribut ing registration forms with Income tax blanks. Some such Federal initiative clearly is the only way to sweep away the maze of state restrictions. Senate hearings on the subject are scheduled for September, and it is not yet too late to improve the situation for 1972. At the very least, the new constitu tional right extended to young people ought not to be compromised by arcane and archaic state laws.

947-> GOVERNOR WEIGHS DRASTIC CHANGES TO CURB WELFARE
ALBANY, March 9—Governor Rockefeller is considering a drastic revision of the state's welfare philosophy that could cut the influx of welfare recipients into the state and require able‐bodied persons on welfare to accept employment in private industry or state‐created jobs. Sources close to the Governor reported today that he hoped to present such a proposal to the Legislature this session. These sources said the Governor was discussing with aides a program in which the state would reduce the number of poverty‐level persons coming to this state and seeking welfare assistance by strict enforcement of housing and health laws. Thus a person or family moving to substandard housing and applying for welfare would be denied public assistance. Health and Housing The move could have the same effect as remidency requirements for welfare recipients which have been declared unconstitutional. Instead of a residency rule the proposal under study by the Governor would set up health and housing criteria on the theory that substandard housing jeopardizes the health and welfare of the slum residents and the whole community. The Governor is also considering strict enforcement of a law enacted in 1969 that requires a welfare recipient to register with the local State Department of Labor employment agency for job placement and to lose his welfare benefits if he refuses a job. Sources close to the Governor said that this law had not been enforced. They cited a statement by Mayor Lindsay that welfare recipients should not be required. to accept menial and dead‐end jobs. Promoting ‘Dependence’ The Governor's exploration of the welfare curbs was disclosed by administration sources after he had issued a brief statement in which he declared that the present welfare system “will ultimately, overload and break down our society.” He added that the present system was not even helping the welfare recipient and was merely promoting “permanent dependence on the government.” Questioning the long‐time claim of welfare administrators that only about 5 per cent of those receiving assistance are able to work, the Rockefeller administration sources raised the strong possibility that local welfare agencies were not properly checking welfare eligibility. “The social workers don't make surprise visits—they tell them they'll. be there next Wednesday,” the Solace said. In an effort to increase the job supply the Governor is also considering creation of a state environmental conservation corps which he mentioned in his gubernatorial campaign. This corps would be the employer of last resort if a welfare recipient could not be placed in private industry. The corps would be responsible for cleanup campaigns and other efforts to end pollution of various kinds. Asked what the state would do if a locality such as New York City refused to go along with the enforcement of the housing and health standards and the job‐availability requirement, the administration source said that the state would withhold its share of welfare payments, slightly less than a third The Federal Government and the locality share the remainder. The newcomer failing to meet these eligibility requirements would be offered emergency assistance — “like lunch,” according to the source—and bus or train ticket to his last residence whether inside or outside the state. If he refused to leave he would be denied welfare assistance. The Governor began exploring the welfare revisions when he became convinced sources said that the Federal Government would not take over the welfare system at the high benefit level of such states as New York and when he saw that some legislators were talking about drastic scross‐the‐board cuts in state welfare allowances. The Governor is fearful that such cuts would hurt those genuinely in need. The disclosure of the Governor's concern over welfare One only ‘five days after. Gov. Ronald Reagan of California, generally considered to be one of the most conservative chief executives in the nation proposed to cut at least 300,000 people from his state's welfare rolls by tightening eligibility standards and creating a state work program for employable welfare recipients. The New York State administration sources conceded that Governor Rockefeller, a liberal Republican, had apparently changed his thinking on the welfare program. The Governor is primarily concerned with the long‐range fiscal and social implications of the welfare problem, the source said, although conceding that a crackdown on welfare would have immediate budgetary implications in the state and locilities particularly New York City. State welfare costs have quadrupled in the 12 years of the Rockefeller administrations. In the proposed budget for the fiscalis starting April 1 welfare is up 40 per cent or $324‐million over the current‐year figure of $895‐million The total Federal, state and local spending for welfare, in the state is about $3‐billion in the current fiscal year. Mr. Rockefeller's staff has also drawn up long‐range fiscal projections of state and local expenditures showing that they are rising primarily because of increased education and welfare costs. These expenditures totaled $43.1‐billion in 1950 $212‐billion this year and would reach a projected total of $359billion by 1980. The. Governor is said to feel that some brake must be put on the speedy increase in local and state government spending. Mr. Rockefeller was also said to be concerned that there had been no slowdown in the migration of poor people from the South to this state. Today a group of Democratic lawmakers, joined by two Republican Senators—Roy M. Goodman of Manhattan and John T Marchi of Staten Island —introduced a bill calling for a phased state take‐over of welfare costs now paid by local governments. And the State League, of Women Voters to whom the Governor spoke today urged him to grant the 7.2 per cent cost‐of‐living increases for welfare recipients proposed in his budget. That increase has already come under strong attack in the Legislature.

948-> India Links World Recognition Of Bangladesh to Troop Pullout
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y. Dec. 22 — Foreign Minister Swaran Singh of India called today for immediate negotiation between India and Pakistan and made it clear that his Government, though pressing for the release of Sheik Mujibur Rahman, did not make this a precondition to the opening of talks. Speaking at a news conference before departing for New Delhi, Mr. Swaran Singh called on the international community to recognize “the reality of Bangladesh.” The sooner that was done, he said, the sooner it would be possible for Indian troops to be withdrawn from East Pakistan, which Bengali insurgents have proclaimed the independent country of Bangladesh (Bengal Nation). Asked about India's strained relations with Washington, Mr. Swaran Singh said quietly but with great emphasis that Washington should realize that India was a “mature and large country” that was not dependent on foreign aid and not afraid at the “irritation” displayed by others. Territorial Ambitions Denied Mr. Swaran Singh declined to give a timetable for the withdrawal of Indian troops from East Pakistan but reiterated earlier statements that India had no territorial ambitions there and would withdraw as soon as possible. For the moment, he said, the presence of Indian troops was needed to protect the Pakistani forces that had surrendered and to prevent reprisals. He predicted that Zultikar All Bhutto, the new Pakistani President, would make a number of quick political moves that were likely to lead to the release of Sheik Mujib. The Sheik, who is the leader of the Awami League, which won all but two of the 169 East Pakistani seats in the December, 1970, election, was transferred from prison to house arrest yesterday, according to reports from Rawalpindi. Mr. Swaran Singh made it clear that he thought Mr. Bhutto had no choice but to negotiate with Sheik Mujib. The sooner this happened, he said, the sooner there would be a return to normalcy in Bangladesh.

951-> The Nation
WASHINGTON — Secretary of the Treasury John B. Connally Jr., in a recent interview in Busi ness Week magazine, observed that the United States should “get tough” with Latin Ameri can countries that expropriate American holdings because, as he put it, “We don't have any friends there anyway.” The views of the former Texas Governor have caused ripples of alarm in Latin America, partly because they represent the an tithesis of Franklin D. Roose velt's “goed neighbor” policy, partly because Mr. Connally, an ulta‐conservative Democrat, is now President Nixon's chief Cabinet political ally. Even more important, Mr. Con nally, as Treasury Secretary, wields immense influence on United States lending policies in Latin America. Last Thursday, it appeared that he was closely at tuning his policies to the views of major American copper inter ests and in the process riding roughshod, ranger‐style, over the State Department's views. Henry Kearns, president of the Export‐Imjort Bank—a fief in the Treasury empire—called in Orlando Letelier, the Chilean Am bassador. For six months, Chile had been awaiting the United States answer to her request for $21‐million in loans and guar antees to help buy three more Boeing airliners for Lan‐Chile, her all‐Boeing fleet. Mr. Kearns was reported warm, and smiling, but his message was icy: no loans, even to buy United States Boeings until Chile gave “satisfactory” assurances on compensation for American cop per interests now being nation alized under a July 16 law. Ambassador Letelier reportedly protested that a commercial Export‐Import Bank loan to help buy two Boeing 707's and one Boeing 727 had no connection with compensation for United States copper interests. He pointed out that the socialist Chilean Government headed by Dr. Salvador Allende Gossens had already negotiated satisfac tory settlements with other'American concerns that it had taken over: Bethlehem Steel, the Bank of North America and the North Indiana Brass Com pany. As for the three copper in terests now being taken over— Anaconda, Kennecott and Cerro — the ambassador noted that the new Chilean law gives the nation's Controller General six months to ascertain their book value and permits both the Chil ean, Government and the Ameri can companies to appeal against his finding. It would have been virtually impossible, he argued, for Chile to arrive at a compen sation offer in the 27 days that hid elapsed since the nationali zation of July 16. The ambassa dor also delivered a written pledge that Chile would assume and repay the $190‐million loan that Ex‐Im had previously made to the three companies. It was, to no avail. Mt. Kearns remained politely unyielding. Be hind him loomed the shadow of Secretary. Connally. Behind Mr. Connally loomed the White House, keenly attuned to the pleadingS of the copper interests. United States business, as sailed by problems at home and abroad, is angry over recent na tionalizations of American and Canadian private holdings in such leftist‐leaning Latin‐Ameri can countries as Chile, Peru, Bo livia and Guyana, and fearful over threats of more expropria tions to come. As President Nixon's political intimate, Mr. Connally must be exquisitely sensitive to the mood of, those business interests, who not only pay taxes and payrolls but who also contribute to Pres idential campaigns. Mr. Connally is said to believe that his policy of “deterrence”—cracking down on Chile—may frighten off other possible expropriating countries. Beneath the surface, however, there looms a major power strug gle between the Treasury and the State Department. Secretary of State William P. Rogers and his chief Latin‐affairs adviser, Charles Appleton Meyer, remain outwardly cool, calm and dis creet, but the State Department is an old hand at bureaucratic in‐fighting. And it is fighting to determine who sets foreign policy. “It's not only a State‐Treasury fight, though there is plenty of that involved,” said one source. “It's the effect that Connally's get‐tough attitude will have on relations with the whole Western Hemisphere. There are /30‐mil lion Latin‐Americans there, and we have other important interests besides copper.” In an even larger sense, the Treasury's semi‐secret order to its men in the International lend ing agencies—‐the World Bank, the Inter‐American Development Bank, the Export — Import Bank and other institutions—to grant no further loans to expropriating countries assumes a priori that the governments In question will not pay fair and prompt compen sation. Until now the World Bank has continued lending to a coun try that nationalizes private as sets so long as it appears ready to pay fair compensation within reasonable time. In addition to the influence of private United States mining and other interests, there is, of course, a political worry in Washington about the political trend tak en by the leftist Govern ment of Dr. Allende, an avowed Marxist, which came in to power over nine months ago. The Allende regime has resumed diplomatic relations with Cuba and has made no secret of its re formist zeal, politically and eco nomically. The broader issues of the Treasury vs. State battle must still go to Mr. Nixon for decision. The fear in some Government circles is that his political need of Mr. Connally will outweigh the value of Secretary Rogers's advice to him. If this comes to pass, Mr. Connally's dictum about “no friends in Lation America” may assume a newer and richer significance.

952-> U.S. Reports 1,600 Blasts In Raids on Arms and Fuel
SAIGON, South Vietnam Wednesday March 10 — Mr strikes by United States fighterbombers in Laos reportedly set off 1,600 explosions of enemy fuel and ammunition supplies yesterday. This total announced by the United States command, was the largest single day's tally of enemy supplies reported destroyed since the start of the Laotion operation Feb. 8. The explosions were counted by American pilots in the same area where South Vietnamese troops had observed 500 secondary explosions set off by B‐52 strikes Sunday about a miles northeast of Tohepone a main enemy supply hub about 25 miles inside Laos. According to a command spokesman American air strikes and South Vietnamese ground forces have already destroyed or captured more enemy ammunition food and other supplies in the last four weeks than the enemy forces lot during the first two months of last year's allied invasion of their sanctuaries in Cambodia. At that time American commanders estimated that the enemy's activities had been set back from six months to a year because of losses in Cambodia. U.S. Cautions on Results However, an American Army spokesman cautioned today that “It's still too early to translate the results of the Laotian orations into an expression of the effect they will have on the enemy.” But it's pretty clear that if you disrupt their base areas you will affect their future operations,” he added. The South Vietnamese command reported today that 13411 tons of enemy ammunition 1,700 tons of food and masses of armaments and equipment had been destroyed in Laos. A Government spokesman reported that 78 enemy soldiers were killed Monday in a battle seven miles west‐northwest Of Laobao on the South Vietnamese border. He said 12 South Vietnamese infantrymen were wounded. Clashes Near Laobao Fifteen enemy soldiers were reported killed by Government troops in another fight seven miles east of Laobao at about the same time Monday. One South Vietnamese infantryman was wounded, the Government spokesman said. Eenemy forces meanwhile kept up their harassment of the American forces in South Vietnam backing up Saigon's troops in Laos. They ambushed a United States supply convoy yesterday morning on Route 9 seven miles west of Camlo on the way to Khesanh. One United States soldier was killed and 21 wounded according to the United States spokesman, while the enemy withdrew without leaving any trace of losses. On Monday, the United States command reported, American soldiers engaged an enemy force four miles west of yesterday's ambush and killed four soldiers. American losses were put at three wounded. In a related development, military sources disclosed that the United States command had moved to reopen an old road running directly from Quangtri to Khesanh to supplement the overworked and vulnerable Route 9 leading from Dongha seven miles north of Quangtri to the allied forward staging base at Khesanh. Rains Imperil Road The sources reported aerial photography flights over the old road. They said that Route 9 which was reopened by United States Army engineers in the preparatory phase of the Laotian operation seven weeks ago, is in danger of being washed away by the mid‐May rains. They also said that its many bridged ravines and hairpin curves made it extremely vulnerable to enemy action. The new road would cut at least a third of the distance between the two important bases, the sources said. Although the sources are not provided with South Vietnamese strategic planning information, they speculated that the road plans indicated that the Government’ intended to keep its troops in the western mountains — and possibly in Laos — past the. onset of the rainy season.

953-> Ugly‐Duckling Tugboat Gets a Streamlining
The tugboat is a familiar sight in the harbors of the world, pushing or pulling many times its own weight to the never‐ending astonish ment of onlookers. But it has never been considered a pleasure craft. Despite its stability and highly functional make‐up, the tug's short, squat design makes it an ugly duckling sister of modern yachts and cruisers, which are becoming increasingly streamlined for greater speed and beauty. But Tugboats, Inc., of Stonington, Conn., believes there is a market for the tug and the equally sea worthy launch in the pleas ure craft field. Henry W. H. Washburn, president of Tugboats, Inc., concedes that the tug de sign is not in the class of streamlined cruisers, but he is not willing to go along with the idea that the tug has no beauty. His company makes about half of its tugs and launches as pleasure boats and the other half as work vessels. He said that while all of the company's tugs and launches have the same basic design, the pleasure craft are de signed more for comfort and beauty with more attractive appointments. The use of time‐tested sta ble boat designs for pleasure craft is not new. For several years, a version of the old Boston Whaler has been used by boat owners on the East Coast with complete satis faction, particularly when the boat is called upon to ride in rough seas. The new series of boats being produced by Tugboats, Inc., was designed by Eldredge‐McInnis. In addi tion to the tug and the launch, the company is offer ing a utility boat and a club launch and cruising model. Washburn said that in de signing the boats the empha sis was placed on giving the owner and greatest amount of use with the fewest prob lems of ownership. All of the boats are pow ered by diesel engines, which Washburn said was accept ed by experienced seamen as safe, reliable and econom ical. But he pointed out that the engine compartment, which is completely below the main deck, would accom modate any engine that was suitable for the boat. In addition, each model is built with a minimum of a one‐ton carrying capacity and when fully loaded, the decks are self‐bailing. Wash burn said that one of his vessels carried as many as 24 persons with no difficulty, although he pointed out that to carry that many people is not ideal, since the ma jority of passengers would have to stand and there would he little elbow room. The tugboat design, which is priced at $8,950 with such stan‐ard equipment as a heavy‐duty handlaid hull and deck, 20‐gallon fuel tank, all teak trim, two beds and a toilet box, is 21½ feet long with a 10‐foot beam. The 20‐gallon fuel tank is sufficient to permit about 80 hours of sailing at cruising speed and slightly less at top speed. With a cruising speed of six knots and a top speed of 6½ knots, the tug is not a particularly fast boat, but it was built for reliability rather than speed. The exhaust is through an aluminum stack behind the pilot house, which is made of mahogany plywood with a fiberglass roof. The inside of the pilot house is var nished and contains cush ioned seats for three per sons, There is a shelter cabin forward with two V‐berths and space for a toilet. The launch is a more open boat, but it also contains a forward cabin with two V‐ berths and room for a toilet. The berths are closed off by a canvas dodger. Its speed is comparable to the tug's, but with a main deck of about 9½x14½ feet it can accommodate a large num ber of passengers. This boat is priced at $6,950. The yacht club launch and the cruising version are cus tom made, with the cruising version containing a forward cabin with full headroom. The price of each of these models depends on what the boatowner wants in the way of appointments. There also is a utility boat with an open‐backed deck‐ house, which is priced at $7,700 and a stripped boat is available at $5,950.

954-> Navy Yard Development Hopes Are Unfulfilled
Two years ago Mayor Lindsay formally received possession of the Brooklyn Navy Yard from the Federal Government and turned it over to a nonprofit corporation called CLICK. Hopes were then high that the organization would develop the yard into an industrial park that would provide 30000 jobs within a decade. Today those hopes are still nurtured by many community leaders and businessmen but some others who once shared the hopes—including some city officials — now express disappointment, frustration and anger. They charge that CLICK, which stands for the Commerce, Labor, Industry Corporation of Kings County has created too few jobs that its executives are drawing “exorbitant” salaries, that some Brookly politicians on the organization's board exert too much influence on the management of the yard and that efforts have been made to use the yard for personal benefit. The criticism of the yard's development comes at a time when the city and CLICK which has been operating the yard on a “right of entry” permit are in the last phase of negotiating a long‐term lease. For the last six weeks, The New York Times has been examining the operation of the yard and investigating reports and charges related to it. Among the findings are the following: ¶CLICK has not built up a strong financial base as yet and is operating at a deficit... ¶The number of jobs created in the yard is less than half the goal set for the end of 1970. ¶A businessman who tried to rent space in the yard said he was asked to donate a 20 per cent interest in his company to receive favorable consideration. This has been denied by those he named. ¶Two members of the organization's board of directors said they left because of disappointment with the management of the yard. CLICK's staff and current board believe that much has been accomplished, despite the complaints and the unmet goals. “Ships are going to be built in the yard again training programs have been started and more than 2,000 jobs have been created,” John Hilly chairman of the board, said. “CLICK has done all that in a time of economic recession and without costing the city or state a cent. I think it's a fine record.” The 265‐acre Navy Yard which employed more than 20000 at its wartime peak and 6,500 workers in the early nineteen‐sixties was closed by the Federal Government as an economy move in 1966. The same year a group of Brooklyn Democrats and businessmen from areas adjacent to the yard formed CLICK to obtain title to the yard for an industrial park. City Buys Property In early 1969, the Nixon. Administration gave the city right of entry to the area and Mayor Lindsay passed it on to CLICK. In June, 1970, when the city bought the yard for $23.5‐million, negotiations were begun for a long‐term lease of the yard to the group. Plans were already being developed for turning the area into an industrial park. In May, 1969, John A. Davis Jr., the chief executive of CLICK, was so confident about the yard's future that he predicted it would provide 5,000 jobs by the end of 1970. The goal did not seem overly ambitious because a month earlier Mr. Davis's organization had reached an agreement with Seatrain Shipbuilding Corporation for a 20‐year lease of 45 per cent of the yard. And Seatrain, Mr. Davis said had guaranteed 3,000 jobs in 18 months Those deadlines have passed and Mr. Davis has moved on to another job in Houston but the 2,200 jobs now filled in the yard are short of CLICK's goal of 5,000. Seatrain is employing about 600 people in the yard, only 20 per cent of the number of Mr. Davis said the company had guaranteed. The other companies in the yard are not doing much better than Seatrain. Of the 22 companies that have relocated to the area only one is meeting the job density goal set by the sponsoring group — one job for every 5,000 square feet of space rented. CLICK's financial status also is not up to its own expectations. The corporation posted $200,000 loss in 1970 and has lost $75,000 so far this year. The 1970 loss would have been greater if the organization had not received $350,000 in pre paid rent from Seatrain. Donald Benjamin, who suc ceeded Mr. Davis on May 22, 1970, as chief executive, and his staff conceded that in some respects the yard's development had not progressed as expected. But they said the reversals were temporary and understandable. The low number of jobs were attributed by Mr. Benjamin to the general economic slowdown “The companies in the yard have not been able to expand as fast as they hoped,” he said. “In fact, two companies that were here had to close down completely.” As for Seatrain Mr. Benjamin said the company had had to put the drydocks in shape and bring in a lot of equipment and it had taken longer than expected. “Seatrain is investing more than $12‐million here and ultimately will provide 6,000 jobs,” he said. “So I think a little understanding when it falls behind some of its commitments is not out of order.” Seatrain officials were not available for comment. CLICK's financial deficit was attributed by Mr. Benjamin to the unprofitable operation of the yard's power plant Edward Conti Jr., the corporation senior vice president said the plant cost $700,000 more to operate last year than the $1.5‐million it earned from selling power to yard tenants. The corporation, Mr. Conti said, wants to convert the plant from coal which is increasingly expensive, to oil and gas. The conversion would reduce the cost of operating the plant by $500,000, he said, and added power use by the tenants would make the plant a profitable operation. That development and expected higher income from rents will according to Mr. Conti and Mr. Benjamin put the corporation comfortably in the black within a short time. These explanations do not satisfy the critics of the corporation, who point out that there are fewer tenants in the yard today than there were a year ago. Disappointment with the pace of the yard's development is one reason the city refused to sign a lease that was approved by the Board of Estimate last year, according to city sources. The rejected lease gave CLICK considerable independence in deciding how to develop the yard. The city demanded negotiations on a new lease that would give the city a greater voice in ‘decisions and allow the Mayor to appoint a majority of the corporation's board. “Mayor Lindsay and all future mayors have the responsibility to protect the $23.5million investment of taxpayer's money,” said John P. Scanlon assistant administrator of the city's Economic Development Administration. “Since the Mayor has that responsibility, he must have the power also to direct the development of the yard for full employment with the participation of community groups.” In preparation for lease negotiations the city had an analysis of the yard prepared by Andrew P. Kerr director of the project management staff of the city's Policy Planning Council. One subject discussed in the report was the salaries of corporation officers. “It is felt that the salaries are inordinately high for a nonprofit community development corporation,” the report said. Mr. Benjamin at first refused to disclose the salaries of the officers, but later allowed his staff to release them. As executive officer he earns $42,500; the senior vice president earns $35,000 and three vice presidents earn between $20,000 and $27,500. CLICK's officers do not think their salaries are high. “We work long hours often late into the night and on weekends, and we earn what we make,” said Ira Mitlin, who makes $20,000 a year as assistant vice president for marketing. The report on the corporation was followed by a memorandum also written by Mr. Kerr and marked “confidential to Deputy Mayor Richard Aurelio.” The six‐page memorandum was a list of “reports, allegations and rumors” about the Navy Yard. It cautioned that the allegations had not been investigated or verified in any way. One of the items in the report mentioned the complaint of an unidentified businessman who said he had been asked to donate an interest in his company to a community corporation in return for favorable consideration for renting space in the Navy Yard. Investigation by The Times found the businessman to be Albert C. Winters, president of Manhattan Store Interiors Inc. Mr. Winters, whose business now occupies two buildings in Brooklyn, said that in 1969 he went to see Mr. Davis and told him that his labor force of 200 could be more than doubled if he could get adequate space in the yard. Mr. Davis, he said, advised him that he would have a better chance for acceptance as a tenant if he had minority group representation on his board of directors. “I told him I could appoint’ one of my Puerto Rican employes to the board but he said he would send me some body to talk to me,” Mr. Winters said. The man who went to see Mr. Winters was Preston Lambert exceutive director of the Brooklyn Local Economic Development Corporation (BLEDCO) a development corporation formed by black businessmen and community leaders in Brooklyn. Three officers of BLEDCO — State Senator Waldaba Stewart Assemblyman Thomas R. Fortune and Enoch Williams—are also directors of CLICK. Mr. Winters said Mr. Lambert had told him that he would be sure of being admitted to the yard if he donated a. 20 per cent interest in his company, which Mr. Winters valued at $1‐million to BLEDCO. Mr. Winters said that he turned down Mr. Lambert's proposal and that a short time later he got a draft lease from the corporation calling for rent more than twice what Mr. Davis had said it would be. When he wrote a letter asking for more discussion of the rent he said he got a reply saying that his letter was rejection of the proposed lease and that the matter was closed. Mr. Mitlin the CLICK officer who wrote the reply and Mr. Lambert dispute the businessman's account. Mr. Lambert said ‘he did go to see Mr. Winters but with the intent of buying an interest in his company, not getting it free. “lie said that he would sell us a 10 per cent interest for $400,000 but that was too much for us and I never called him back,” Mr. Lambert said. Mr. Mitlin said that the $75000‐a‐year rent Mr. Winters offered for 190,000 square’ feet of space was “so ridiculously low, about 40 cents a square foot, that there was no point in going on with him.” Mr. Winters said that the price that Mr. Davis had mentioned to hire was 80 cents square foot for “usable Space” and that the rest of the space in the building was not usable. Mr. Davis, in a telephone conversation from Houston, said that he could not remember if he had mentioned any price to Mr. Winters. He did recall he said, that the building Mr. Winters was interested in was too large for his needs and he thought that Mr. Winters and BLEDCO might use it together. So he asked Mr. Lambert to go see Mr. Winters he said. CLICK's critics are not limited to businessmen like Mr. Winters, John Mulhern a former priest in Brooklyn, said he left the board because he was “disillusioned and disappointed” with the operation. He said the board and officers were dominated by two Democratic politicians on the board—Stanley Steingut Democratic leader of Brooklyn and Senator Stewart, Mr. Steingut was in the group that formed CLICK and Senator Stewart was one of 15 community leaders elected later. Mr. Mulhern who now works for a city task force charged that many’ staff members at CLICK owed their jobs to Mr. Steingut and Mr. Stewart. Mr. Steingut is frequently not present at board meetings he said but his power is exerted through his counsel C. Daniel Chill who is also Counsel for CLICK. “Chill is not a member of the board, but he is always making motions, debating measures and generally going far beyond his role as CLICK's counsel,” Mr. Mulhern said. At one point, Mr. Mulhern said an effort was made to replace Mr. Chill with a house counsel but the movement never got off the ground because of the strong influence of Mr. Steingut. “John Davis, the former chief executive told me once that he had to clear most of his big decisions with Steingut,” Mr. Mulhern said. Charges Are Denied Mr. Davis, Mr. Chill, Mr. Stewart and Mr. Hilly deny Mr. Mulhern's charges. Mr. Steingut said that he had wanted to resign from the board for more than a year but he had stayed on at the insistence of others. He will resign he said, as soon as lease negotiations with the city are concluded. Mr. Chill said he didn't become counsel because he was counsel to Mr. Steingut. “In fact,” he said, “it was the other way around. Mr. Steingut thought well of the work I had done for CLICK and asked me to become his counsel.” Mr. Chill said Mr. Mulhern was just bitter because he lost a community’ election to represent Williamsburgh on the board. Mr. Hilly said he did not recall any “meaningful movement” to replace Mr. Chill with a house counsel. Mr. Stewart called Mr. Mulhern's charges “totally unfounded.” “Mulhern is the one who tried to dominate the board and when he failed, he quit,” Mr. Stewart added. Mr. Mulhern is not the only director who left in professed disappointment. Sam Meyers a United Auto Workers official said he left two years ago because of the slow pace of the yard's development. “It's going to take money and imagination to make something of the yard,” he said. “CLICK started as a shoestring operation and it has remained a shoestring operation.” But the corporation's supporters include many yard tenants. “CLICK's people are dedicated and hardworking,” said Max Apfelbaum president of the Nathor Coffee Roasting Corporation which has leased one of the yard's 40 buildings. “I think they'll make a major success of this place.” They with have ample opportunity. The lease the city is expected to sign will be for 39 years, with two 30‐year options.

955-> JOBLESSNESS ROSE TO 7.6% LAST YEAR IN SLUM SECTIONS
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24—Un employment in poor urban neighborhoods, which was on the decline prior to last year, increased sharply in 1970, the Labor Department reported today. In a year‐end report, the de partment's Bureau of Labor Statistics said the reversal was caused by the economic slump. The report said the jobless rate in urban poverty sections averaged 7.6 per cent during 1970, up from 5.5 per cent in 1969. “It was also significantly higher than either the 1968 [6 per cent] or the 1967 [6.8 per cent] rate,” the report said. The rate for teen‐aged resi dents of poor neighborhoods in creased from 19.9 per cent to 24. The rate for black young sters rose from 27.9 per cent to 35.8 per cent, and for poor white youths from 13.8 per cent to 16.3. The figures showed that job lessness among black teen agers in the last quarter of 1970 increased greatly over the same period the previous year —from 26.7 per cent to 42.2— in these neighborhoods. For the same periods, the rate for white teen‐agers in these sections increased from 11 per cent to 18.8, and the rate for all teen‐agers in these neighborhoods from 17.4 per cent to 27.8. “However,” the report stat ed, “since the over‐all jobless rate for the nation as a whole also rose between 1969 and 1970, from 3.5 per cent to 4.9 per cent, the large gap be tween poverty neighborhoods and over‐all U.S. jobless rates remained virtually unchanged.” The bureau reported, “A dis proportional part of the rise in poverty area joblessness be tween 1969 and 1970 occurred among white workers. The job less rate for whites, at 6.3 per cent in 1970, was up about one‐half over the 1969 rate, while the rate for blacks was 9.5 per cent, rose proportion ately more slowly. As a result, the ratio of black‐to‐white un employment rates in poverty neighborhoods edged down from 1.7 to 1 in 1969 to 1.5 to 1 in 1970.” Labor experts have explained that the proportionate slow down in the rate of increase in black employment is due to joblessness in fields where fewer blacks are employed. The report said that the rate for all adult men in poor sec tions went from 3.6 per cent to 6.2, with the rate for white males rising more, proportion ately, than that for blacks. The white rate was up from 3.1 per cent in 1969 to 5.7 last year, while the rate for black males rose from 4.3 per cent to 7.1. The rate for adult women was 5.7 per cent last year, up from 5.1 per cent in 1969. For nonpoor urban neighbor hoods, the increase was from 1.9 per cent in 1969 to 3.3 per cent last year. The black rate rose from 3.1 per cent to 4.5, the white percentage from 1.8 per cent to 3.2. The rate for women in nonpoverty sections increased from 3.3 per cent to 4.5, with the black rate going from 4.2 per cent to 5.7 and the white figure from 3.2 per cent to 4.3. The over‐all increase for non poor teen‐agers was from 11.4 per cent to 14.5. “The general decline in eco nomic activity in 1970 reversed the improvement in jobless rates that had been made by poverty area residents between 1967 and 1969,” the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. The bureau reported that of 3.4 million workers in poor neighborhoods, 3.2 million were employed and 213,000 unem ployed during 1970. Of 23.2 million nonpoor in urban areas, 22.4 million were employed while 767,000 were out of work. The rates are for the coun try's 100 largest metropolitan areas, the bureau said.

956-> 6 Newsmen to Interview Nixon Over 2 Radio Networks Tonight
WASHINGTON, April 15 —An hour‐long interview with President Nixon by four newspaper executives and two reporters will be broadcast live on radio tomorrow night. The National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System announced today that they would carry the interview, which is scheduled for the final session of this year's convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. The White House ruled out the televising of the interview. It will be broadcast on radio at 9 P.M. Interviewing the President will be Emmett Dedmon, editorial director of The Chicago Sun‐Times and Daily News; William B. Dickinson, executive editor of The Philadelphia Bulletin; Sylvan Meyer, editor of The Miami News; Otis Chandler, publisher of The Los Angeles Times; Eugene V. Risher, White House correspondent of United Press International, and Frank Cormier, White House correspondent of The Associated Press. Editors Hear Jackson At a luncheon meeting today, the editors, who have been meeting since Tuesday at the Shoreham Hotel, heard Senator Henry M. Jackson, Democrat of Washington, advocate a one‐year moratorium on the deployment of most offensive and defensive nuclear weapons by the United States and the Soviet Union. Senator Jackson, who has been mentioned as a contender for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1972, said that the strategic balance was “tilting in favor of Moscow." He said that his proposal would “at once have the effect of slowing the strategic arms competition and adding to the immediate security of the strategic balance.” The Senator, a member of the Armed Services Committee, added that China was not a serious strategic threat” to either the United States or the Soviet Union “now or for the rest of the nineteen‐seventies.”

957-> Vratislav Trcka Dies at 81; A Former Czech Diplomat
Vratislav Trcka, a former Czechoslovak diplomat, died yesterday here. He was 81 years old and lived in the Andrew Freedman Home, the Bronx. Mr. Trcka held a Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Prague. In World. War as, a journalist in Paris, he worked to promote Czechoslovakia's independence with Eduard Benes and Thomas Masaryk, both later Presidents of the country. Subsequently he served as a consular minister and in 1943 watt his country's first Minister to Bogota, Colombia.

959-> Flipflop at Tarrytown
Governor Rockefeller won the commendation of environmentalists at a weekend workshop in Tarrytown what seems to us too low a price. In a single speech the Governor managed to renounce a highway project already virtually killed by judicial action and at the same time to ridicule the tough and laudable bill with which Senator Muskie of Maine has proposed to clean up the country's waterways. It was good, of course, to get Mr. Rockefeller's word that the Hudson River Expressway, which he had devotedly advocated, was now “a dead issue.” Originally conceived as a 47‐mile swath of concrete from the North Bronx to Beacon, the project shrank under attack to proposed ten‐mile link between Tarrytown and Crotonville—still enough to have done irreparable damage to stretch of the Hudson's historic shoreline. Though the Governor could not forbear a parting shot at the “political opportunism” of his opponents, he generously noted that “people's priorities are changing,” an observation probably based on the recent defeat of a transportation bond issue providing vast funds for more highways. Whatever pleasure may be derived from the Governor's abandonment of the Expressway is tempered, however, by his using the occasion for an extravagant attack on the Senate's bill to check water pollution. If the measure's objective of ending pollutant discharges by 1985 were “to be carried out literally on a national basis,” the Governor observed, “the cost would be well over $1 trillion” instead of the $20 billion put forward in the legislation. Even the distorting word “literally” would not account for the Governor's astronomical figure, based on the requirement “to treat every drop of rain that fell on city streets.” But it should be recalled that Senator Muskie made it perfectly plain that his committee does not expect the nation to achieve a 100 per cent elimination pollutants by 1985—or perhaps ever. To apply a price tag to such a standard, he expressly stated, “can serve no purpose other than to frighten the people and intimidate the Congress.” He used, instead, the phrase “wherever attainable” and emphasized the purpose to restore and maintain the biological integrity of the nation's waters. But to make those phrases meaningful, his bill would in fact demand high standards and impose strong Federal controls. It was this intention, one suspects, rather than the statement of a desirable time goal, that disturbed the Governor, just as it has clearly disturbed President Nixon. We hope that the House Public Works Committee, now drawing up parallel legislation, shares the Senate's unanimous view that the approach is as sound as the goal admirable.

960-> Unitas Could've Played ‘If They Needed Me’
MIAMI, Jan. 17—Johnny Unitas was injured today when George Andrie, a Cow boy defensive end, tackled him in the act of passing. “With my right arm up, my ribs were open,” Unitas said. “He got me with his helmet or his shoulder, I don't know which. They hurt, but they're not broken. They took X‐rays right here to find that out immediately. I could've gone back if they'd needed me.” “I'm happy for Earl, he did a fine job,” Unitas said. “I did not mind not going back in. That was the coach's de cision. Earl was down in the dumps after our other Super Bowl, and it was great that he could come hack.” Don McCafferty, the coach, explained that he had kept Morrall in the game even though Unitas was available because “Earl was doing a fine job and I saw no reason to make a change.”

961-> Market Place: Taking Look At Big Banks
Short‐term Money rates have been rising precipit ously since the beginning of April. As a result money market banks are about to go through an earnings wringer, after showing generally ex cellent first‐quarter results. Yes, second‐quarter results will make grim reading and things are not going to clear; up immediately. If that sounds like a good reason to avoid the stocks of money market banks, listen to a generally more upbeat inter pretation from Keefe, Bruy ette & Woods, Inc., a leading bank‐stock analyst. Keefe thinks that, among other higher short term, interest rates Should lead to rising prime‐rate levels to ease the difficult third‐ and fourth‐quarter earnings comparisons for the money‐market banks. • Keefe's quarterly analysis, out June 10, is loaded with thumbnail sketches. Take the item on the Bank America Corporation, the West coast giant so much the news Keefe thinks this behemoth should earn $5 a share for this year, up from $4.75 a year ago, or more than a 5 per cent gain. Keefe comments that the reduc tion in the passbook earnings rate from 41/2 to 4 per cent will aid results “significant ly” and that if the prime rate moves up further, earnings could be higher ‐still. Keefe‐is predicting a tough second quarter for the Bank ers Trust New York Corpo ration. While first‐quarter earnings were up 81/2 per cent to $1.41 a share from $1.30 a share a year earlier, the rise in short‐term inter est rates, Keefe says, will likely reduce the spread be tween yields and rates paid for funds, However, the analyst says, third‐ and fourth‐quarter comparisons may be less onerous than those faced by other banks since last year the corporation had, among other things, heavy loan‐loss charge‐offs and heavy write offs from credit card fraud losses. For the full year Keefe expects the bank's earnings to rise to between $5.40 and $5.50 a share against $5.28 a share last year. The Chase Manhattan Cor poration will have a disap pointing second quarter, it appears to Keefe, but should turn in earnings of $4.50 to $4.55 a share for the year, compared with a restated $4.34 a share in 1970.

962-> A Silent Minority Supports Forest Hills Housing Plan
Mrs. Jean. Rosenthal was sitting under a hair dryer in a Forest Hills beauty shop when a conversation exploded around her concerning the lowincome housing project planned for the middle‐income community. The site is two blocks from her home. “Everybody was against it,” she said yesterday. “The climate of that discussion was so heated it was almost frightening. I just stayed under the dryer. And stayed quiet. “I'd had to do a lot of thinking about it myself. But mixing things this way is the fair way to integrate and just because it's in my own backyard, I can't in good conscience oppose it.” Mrs. Rosenthal is among the community's residents who feel themselves, if not a silent majolty, at least a thoroughly outshouted minority in their support for the project and its controversial location. “We're very troubled about how to make ourselves heard,” said Mrs. Blanche Brody. “We live in a private home and we don't feel ourselves or our property at all threatened by the project.” “We lived in an integrated community in Flushing when the children were small and we were active in the parents association, and I don't see the problems being unsolvable here.” In what one of them called a “keep‐the‐lid‐on statement,” five rabbis and three Protestant clerymen from Forest Hills and Rego Park asked yesterday for an end to “the hysterical and violent reactions... which are irreponsible and destructive.” They said an effort to “involve a Jewish issue in the controversy” or any other appeal to “ethnic or religious parochialism” could only lead to “extremism and polarization” and they asked the community to “avoid panic and action based on fear.” Grace Birnbaum, a recent Pratt Institute graduate who lives eight blocks rom the site, said her experience with people circulating protest petitions had settled into a pattern. “I open the door and they say Sign here against the project. Then I say I'm not signing and they say Are youl a hippie? Or maybe a Communist?’ “I consider myself pretty conservative politically and know I have prejudices, but don't carry it so far to tell people where they can live.” She said she could “sympathize with the people who moved out here to escape and are busting their brains and working at two jobs to stay here.” But she thought the neighborhood was “doing the worst possible thing” because it was “assigning a role to people before they ever move in—tellthem they're the bad guys and why shouldn't they live up to it?” Many of the project's supporters were eager to talk about it at length but reluctant to give their addresses or even their names. A man in a supermarket at Lefrak City, a few blocks from the site across the Long Island Expressway, said, “How could I have negative feelings about it? I'm in favor of low‐cost housing and scattering it around to break up the slums.”

963-> PRICES RETREAT IN BOND MARKETS
Bond prices staged a general retreat yesterday, responding to news of accelerating consumer price increases and a tendency for prospective buyers to hold back for still higher yields. The State of California put $100‐million of its bonds on the auction block and the winning underwriters priced the issue to yield 15 to 20 basis points more than provided by a similarly rated although smaller Wis consin offering last Thursday. Investors nevertheless had left $58.4‐million of the Cali fornias unsold by day's end. In the corporate sector, a $150‐million offering by the Michigan Bell Telephone Company on Monday made little additional progress with one mutual fund accounting for what gain there was. The Michi gan Bells, yielding 7.80 per cent, are still believed to be less than 40 per cent placed. The market for Government securities also declined, some issues by as much as half a point and more. After the close, however, the Treasury announced the results of bidding yesterday on $2.25‐ billion of 16 1/2‐month 6 per cent notes and traders declar‐ ed that they reflected substan tialy stronger interest than was indicated beforehand. The average bid was ‘100, yielding 6.00 per cent; the low I was 99.93, or 6.05, and the high was 100.38, or 5.71. Of bids at the low price, 81 per cent were accepted, the Treasury said. Tenders totaled $4‐billion, with $400‐million ac cepted at the average price on a noncompetitive basis. The Treasury had said it would not accept any bids of less than 99.76, but despite “gloom and doom” in the mar ket, as one trader described it interest in the notes was en livened, partly spurred by retail demand. In the California tax‐exempt offering, the First National City Bank won the issue with a bid resulting in a net interest cost of 5.36 per cent. This was better than that of the other bidding group led by the Bank of America, which offered a 5.40 rate. The state's preceding sale in April produced a cost of 5.69 per cent. “The market's doing kind, of poorly, it really seems demoral ized,” one trader commented as he noted the consumer price acceleration some blocks of tax‐exempts offered for sale in the secondary market and the announcement Monday of large Public Housing Authority offering for next month. California's bonds were sold for water pollution clean‐up, recreational development and veterans' farm and home loans. Rated Aa‐AAA, they yield 4.30 in 1976; 5.00 in 1981, 5.50 in 1986 and 6.30 in 1991. In a negotiated offering ex pected to reach the market to day, a Blyth‐led syndicate set tentative terms for $75.5‐mil lion Eugene, Ore., Trojan Nu clear Project Revenue bonds. A total of ‐$59,085,000 of 2009 term bonds is to carry a 6¾ per cent coupon and a price of 100. The balance, serials from 1975 to 1990, will yield from 4.25 to 6.20. The bonds are rated A‐AA. Elsewhere, the Farmers Home Administration decided upon 77/g per cent coupon for its $250‐million offering of 10‐ year, insured notes this morn ing through a Merrill Lynch group. The price ‘for the non callable notes issued in denom inations of $500,000 is 100. The Tennessee Valley Au thority sold yesterday $160‐ million of 126‐day discount notes at an average rate of 5.543 per cent, up from 4.911 in May and the highest since last October's 6.286 per cent. The Industrial Nucleonics Cor poration marketed $15‐million of 5% per cent convertible de bentures at 100 after negotia tion with a William Blair syndi cate. The 20‐year issue is convertible at 35 7/8, or a 14.8 per cent premium. The Borden Overseas Capital Corporation is expected to sell $25‐million of 20‐year deben tures early next month in the Eurobond market. The issue will be convertible into Borden, Inc., stock and also guaranteed by the parent concern. Morgan &amp; Cie International is the man ager.

964-> State of the Paperback
Most book publishers, like most U.S. businessmen, are singing the blues these short winter days, but not those whose mission in life is to keep the newsstand and bookshop racks stocked with paperbacks. It's hard to find a soft cover publisher who won't acknowledge that he's selling “at least 10 per cent more” copies of his wares than he was a year ago, with an average increase of more than 30 per cent in cover price making up for rises in production costs. (Firm figures won't be available until next fall, but an educated guess is that more than 400 million paperbacks were sold in the past year, at an average retail price close to one dollar.) Paperback sales are currently paced by a handful of titles that the publisher of each claims is “the fastest selling history.” Fawcett has printed 7,500,000 copies of Mario Puzo's “The Godfather” since last March and has already sold more than 6 million of them—the first paperback ever to reach that figure. New American Library has printed 8,145,000 copies of Erich Segal's “Love Story” since mid November. Bantam has printed more than 5 million copies of Dr. David Reuben's “Everything You Always Wanted Know About Sex,” Dell 5,800,000 copies of the pseudonym ous J's “The Sensuous Woman,” Pocket Books 2,500,000 copies of Harold Robbins's “The Inheritors”—all of them in the past month. It will be many months until the final returns of the sweepstakes are in. But this much is clear— this winter's shortage of spare cash for expensive entertain ment is luring citizens to paperback racks in unaccustomed numbers. They come to buy the best sellers and leave with copies of others as well. With so many Amencans In the habit of buying paper backs—a recent market survey indicated that 30 per cent of the total U.S. population buys one every three months; 35 per cent of these are paid for by persons under 30; per cent by persons over 50—the presses turn out nearly 1,000 new titles each month. There are now more than 90,000 titles in print, up from 80,000 a year ago. No single bookstore stocks more than 20,000 of these, most only few thousand. Naturally the man who wants to buy a title more than a few months old finds it hard to come by. Hope for solving his problem is now on the horizon. In a few large cities paperback wholesalers, discouraged by a drop sales of magazines, their other chief commodity, are open ing chains of stores with large stocks of older as well as the current paperback titles. To find 1,000 new titles worth issuing a month requires editorial enterprise and imagination—qualities every suc cessful paperback publisher has in good measure. Tried‐and true sources continue to be combed: the best‐seller lists the past, the output of seasoned writers of staples (mystery and suspense, gothics, historical romance, westerns, science fiction), well‐reviewed scholarly and special studies for the academic market. Burgeoning popular interest in astrology, parapsychology, the occult and nostalgia is leading some houses to experiment with new variations on these old themes. One house, Bantam, is experimenting with a new type of comic book in paperback format, “Blackmark” by name. By all odds the most significant editorial development of the past year has been the numerous books concerned with the overriding crises of our times—subjects to which this paperback section is largely devoted. A large propor tion, because of their timeliness, are issued simultaneously in both hard‐cover and soft‐cover editions. Normally a few thousand of the former edition find homes in the shelves of libraries and other institutions, but the bulk of the sale is in paperback to individuals. One house, Yale Univer sity Press, has introduced a further switch in publishing practice with a series of “Yale Fastbacks” on current prob lems, rushed through the press in soft covers, brought out at a more academic pace later on in hard cover. In the past, distribution of paperbacks for children has been largely through classroom‐oriented book clubs serviced by Scholastic, American Educational Publications and Young Readers Press. Within the last few months Doubleday, Holt and Random House have announced plans to join Dell, Har court, Viking and Washington Square Press in trying to reach children through the open market. As the future of reading and books lies in the minds of the young, this perhaps the most encouraging development of the year in paperbacks. ■

965-> A Reappraisal
The new “medium‐size” theaters in the Broadway area do offer great possi bilities to Broadway and also a fresh and valid alternative to Off Broadway. “Happy Birthday, Wanda June,” by Kurt Vonnegut Jr., is un happily, a little too bright, sophisticated and interestingly flawed to survive in the ordinary Broad way jungle, But now, having moved from the Theater de Lys downtown to the Edison Theater uptown, it has the chance to dazzle and enchant that still‐select audience whose concept of comedy goes further than pratfalls and stand‐up one liners. • Mr. Vonnegut is a wicked man slashing at the well‐ pressed fabric of our society. He is a patriotic un‐Amer ican of a breed that has been traditional since Thomas Adams. Mr. Vonnegut, as anyone knows who has read his novels, has a madly relevant sense of fun. Like all the best satirists he has an overblown concept of the ridiculous, which gives the work a joyousness as well as a bitterness. I had been told that “Wanda June” had been changed from its Off Broad way production, but such changes as there are seem minimal. Admittedly it is now cast in three acts rather than two, but the lines seem the same, and the still awkward dramatic structure and in conclusive joke‐ending re main untouched. What has changed is the performance, which is now that little but vital touch more authoritative. Usually an Off Broadway show does not have the same oppor tunities for polishing as Broadway plays enjoy, and although this is the same cast as at the Theater de Lys, the performance I saw was in every way superior. This is delightful acting, and the cast now has the precise measure of Vonnegut's an archic visions. • Kevin McCarthy as the Hemingway‐style killer‐Amer ican is brilliantly funny, and as his sidekick (a bewildered ex‐Air Force pilot who dropped the atom bomb on Nagasaki) William Hickey is faultless. But the entire cast goes to Vonnegut's world with such manic comic energy that the play now develops a swirling force that carries all disbelief be fore it. To be sure, Vonnegut has more to learn about play writing than many people have forgotten, but what he does not have to learn is how to make people laugh and feel afraid at the same time. It is no small savage gift.

TO THE EDITOR: It seems that most people only write about the unfor tunate or unpleasant things that happen to them and overlook the good ones. But a recent experience showed me that the world is full of wonderful people. My husband and I planned to spend the winter with friends in Barbados and ar rived there early in December on the Queen Elizabeth 2 from New York. Then, on Dec. 21, my husband was taken critically ill and spent nine days at the Queen Eliza beth Hospital in Barbados. Everyone from the top man down was kind to us, and even strangers donated blood; this was absolutely, necessary if my husband had any chance of surviving and re turning home to Connecticut for further medical treat ment. Finally, the doctor said that if we could get plane reservations the following morning my husband might be able to fly home safely as a stretcher case accompanied by a doctor and nurse. We were lucky since one of the friends we were staying with is a nurse and she continued to be of assistance and ac companied us home. Time was of the essence . . . a matter of hours . . . and our friends contacted the British West Indian Airways early in the morning. By 10 A.M. I was advised that 11 seats (yes 11, since it was a stretcher case) had been made available to us on the 2 P.M. flight to New York, Needless to say this took a lot of work and quick planning on the B.W.I.A. manager's part in Barbados. The airline also cabled its New York office and arranged for an ambulance to meet the plane to bring us directly to Yale‐New Haven Hospital in New Haven. We were met on the plane by B.W.I.A. representatives and escorted through customs and immi gration while my husband, the doctor and the nurse were put in the ambulance. We received wonderful service, but I honestly feel that it would be extended to anyone in an emergency. My husband is now home and recuperating slowly thanks to strangers to us in B.W.I.A., and from Barbados to New York City to New Haven. Old Saybrook, Conn.

967-> KOLTON SUPPORTS NEW REGULATION
Paul Kolton, president of the American Stock Exchange, called yesterday for the crea tion of a new regulatory frame work for the securities indus try. In his first public address since taking over the Amex presidency last week from Ralph S. Saul Mr. Kolton out lined the priorities he sees in Wall Street today and said bet ter regulation was one of them. Mr. Kolton made his views known in a speech before an annual conference of the In vestment Bankers Association in Santa Barbara, Calif. Copies were distributed in New York. “A new regulatory frame work is needed,” he said, “be cause we have seen that as an industry our growth requires an improved mechanism for governing it.” He identified this as one of four priorities for the investment community. The others were: ¶Resolution of a new com mission structure for securities transactions, so that “the in dustry can plan for the future in a coherent, organized way.” ¶Building greater efficiency into the transaction cycle, so that costly overlapping proce dures can be eliminated and the high overhead burdens built up recently can be controlled or reduced. ¶Making the public markets more viable by assuring that they serve adequately the needs of small, nonprofessional inves tors and do not shift their focus toward professionals. Mr. Kolton noted that the development of a new regula tory framework would depend to a great extent on the rec ommendations that will ema nate from the comprehensive study of the exchange commun ity now being undertaken by William McChesney Martin Jr., former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. When the Martin study was conceived, Mr. Kolton said, there was tacit recognition that both Government and self regulators had assumed for too long that the important ele nents comprising the industry could be reached and regu lated in the public interest, by existing securities industry organizations.” He continued: “However, it has become painfully obvious that large segments of the in dustry are not within the ef fective reach of such regula tion—that powerful forces in the markets were not antici pated by law or organization— that no self‐regulatory body can enforce decisions on the diverse business of today and that confusion and conflict can develop when guidelines are missing.” This statement no doubt was in part a reference to the issues of Institutional trading and membership in exchange markets. Certain large finan cial institutions such as insur ance companies and mutual funds have Joined regional ex changes and are trying to gain access to the principal ex changes in New York. Institutions now dominate the trading on the New York Stock Exchange and are responsible for a great portion of the trad ing on regional exchanges. Yet the regulatory apparatus that now exists was not originally set up to oversee their ac tivities. Mr. Kolton also attempted to quell speculation on a merger between the Big Baard and the Amex. “We have had no merger discussions with the N.Y.S.E.,” he asserted. “We are planning none. I cannot be more direct that that. …”

968-> Books of The Times
Poetry is almost as popular as pot with the young these days. In the spring of 1969, at the Poetry Festival sponsored by Lehigh's School of Education, more than 1,000 people participated. Out of this Woodstock of poetry came the greater part of this book—11 essays by 10 poets and/or teachers who conducted workshops at “inner city” elementary or high schools. The festival seems to have created an infectious atmosphere, for there is a surprising unanimity in these pieces. Almost all of them might be described as militant in their approach to poetry. Liberation is the dominant motif and poetry is most often defined by what it is not. A litany of admonitory “cannots” and “must nots” is addressed to the reader, as if all our usual expectations must be swept away before poetry—as unspoiled as the wild boy of Averon—can appear. Shakespeare is irrelevant; LeRoi Jones is not. Relevance derives not from the human condition, but from conditions as we know them in the parlance of politics. Myra Cohn Livingston, for example, wants to “throw out” the poetry that children cannot “relate” to at first sight. Poetry, we are told, must be written with the heart, not the head. It must not pander to the beautiful. To the inner‐city child, form or technique in poetry is akin to oppression. To defy all such rules is one of his civil rights. New Definition of Poetry Perhaps there should be an asterisk after the statement by Nancy Larrick, the editor, that there is an incredible eruption of poetic activity among kids today, because what she and her collaborators have done is to redefine poetry to include just about anything written down on paper in irregular lines. While it is undoubtedly good thing to democratize poetry and rescue it from the snobbery of elitism, there is a difference between democracy and anarchy, between turning kids on and turning them loose. These authors appear to be overreacting. In our poetry, as in our politics, we may be doomed to progress mainly in pendulum swings. One would think that no one had ever expressed any emotion in poetry before, that beauty was beyond the reach of ordinary people, something sold only in Tiffany's. Though many observers have found ghetto children to be quick‐witted and alert to nuances, the authors of some of these essays equate poverty with inarticulateness, verbal deficiency and unresponsiveness. As a result, they tend to assume a heavy solicitousness that makes their pupils selfconscious and imposes a pattern on their thinking as well. Shakespeare has been expunged, but the social worker has not. “Who knows from whence I came?/Who knows my name?” “... war war/why do God's children fight among each other/like animals...” This is not the natural voice of children. Just as people are said to be in love with love, some of the writers in this book seem to be more in love with the idea of children writing poetry than with poetry itself. Claudia Lewis is disproportionately delighted by a 3‐year‐old who, on first seeing a bunch of blue grapes, exclaimed: “Oh, blueberries on the cob!” Exceptions to the Majority Karla Kushkin is an exception to the evangelical tone of the majority. She is relaxed, undogmatic and in tune with the children, both in her teaching and in her own poetry. Eve Merriam, after squandering several pages on a rather forced analysis of one of her poems, says some interesting things about the ways in which language is undersold in supermarkets and redeemed in the mouths of children. The stereotypical productions of June Jordan's pupils do not support her assertion that “poetry poses an urgent liberation for all children.” “I cultivate my hysteria,” Charles Baudelaire said, and this is how Warren Doty and Samuel Robinson approach their pupils —but with very dissimilar results. One of their teen‐age poets must have John Coltrane blowing and incense burning before he can recite his work. But with all this atmospheric encouragement, he can come up with nothing better than this: Be Be Be Be BeBe Be Be Bum... You wliiiiite Deeeviiil... You existing projection of artificial everything, etc. One wonders whether all attempts at education need to sound quite so remedial. In his recent “Wishes, Lies and Dreams,” Kenneth Koch, for example, managed to get children from similar backgrounds to write fresh poems without making a Federal case out of it. And it would be reassuring, for a change, to see some of these teachers asking students to rise to poetry, instead of invariably demanding that poetry come down to them. Stll, it is pleasant to see so many people even thinking about poetry, however they define it. And one certainly agrees with these writers that poetry ought to be freed from pedantry. However, to keep from losing not only our perspective but also our sense of humor it ought to be pointed out that there is a pedantry of permissiveness too.

969-> City's Small Parks Joyless in Neglect
Angry and frustrated over what they call long‐standing city neglect of their neighborhood parks, some Brooklyn residents and their Assemblyman led parks officials yesterday on a depressing tour of burned‐out comfort stations, shattered fountains and wading pools, torn fences, missing swings, broken benches and weedgrown asphalt play lots. “Maybe I'm naive,” Assemblyman Stephen J. Solarz told Deputy Parks Administrator Joseph P. Davidson in Little Kelly Park at East 16th Street and Avenue S, “but find it incongruous that we can send a man to the moon and back in two weeks and it takes two and a half years to fix a broken bathroom.” The tour, during which Mr. Davidson ordered aides to attend to the various problems while also noting the difficulty of combating vandalism, testified to an area of growing community concern: the state of the city's smaller parks. Series of Complaints Probably only crime ranks higher as a preoccupation of New Yorkers these days, according to complaints expressed at community board meetings around the city. For its part, the Parks Department sees itself as a victim of internal budgetary restrictions and external vandalism. Mr. Davidson said in a recent interview that the city's hiring freeze had cost the loss by attrition of 950 parks workers out of a staff of 6,500 in the last two and a half years. Vandalism, he said, is up 162 per cent since 1966 and is currently costing about $1million a year. It was an accumulating series of complaints about five small parks in Brooklyn that prompted Assemblyman Solarz and two other local Democrats, Committeemen Herbert Saul Lupka and Mrs. Lenore Friedman, to ask August Heckscher, Administrator of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs, to see the problems for himself. At the last minute yesterday, Mr. Heckscher was reported to be not feeling well and Mr. Davidson, his top deputy, substituted for him, leading a delegation of other city, borough and district park officials, At Little Kelly Park, the visitors were shown the comfort station, shut down since it was vandalized two and a half years ago. Because it contained the plumbing for the park, the drinking fountain and wading pool were also inoperative. “It's shameful,” said Mrs. Rebecca Sales, a resident who described herself as “amazed and hysterical” that she had to leave the park each time she or her little granddaughter needed water or a toilet. Net‐less Tennis Courts At nearby Big Kelly Park, at Avenue S and East 13th Street, residents showed tennis courts that had been without nets for at least seven years, Last September preparations were finally made to buy nets—for next season, residents hope. To the cynicism and annoyance of some of the neighborhood youths, park employes painted the baselines of the net‐less courts last week. “Just because you were coming,” said Howard Prince, 17 years old. “No,” retorted Mr. Davidson. “It's the regular fall fixit program.” But other residents also reported that the six parks scheduled for the tour—the others were Kolbert Park, Mellett Park, Homecrest Park, and Bedford Park—were subjected to a quick cleanup that removed glass, stagnant water and trash. Other neighborhood parks in the city have not even had such superficial attention. For years, Bronx residents around the thin park strip along Aqueduct Avenue West between Kingsbridge and Fordham Roads have been complaining about accumu lating trash, broken glass and beer cans in the children's sandboxes, torn fences and—most annoying—dog excrement all over the park in defiance of a sign for owners to keep their pets out. “We get nothing for our taxes,” said Mrs. Joan Ryan, who with other residents complained that they never saw the workers the Park Department told them last summer were assigned to the park. There was no sign of any staff on a recent visit there. Last summer, Mrs. Ryan said, neighbors collected $400 of their own money to buy gardening and cleaning equipment and seeds and planted flowers. In October, she said, a park employe showed up and mowed them down. Gilbert Edwards, another resident, recalled trying to stop him, only to he told, he said, “Well, who told you to plant them?” In Queens, residents at a recent community board meeting complained about vandalized benches, and torn fences in Forest Park. And a sprightly, modern playground at 68th Avenue and Yellowstone Boulevard was shown to have fallen victim to an endemic disease: its vandalized comfort station was bolted shut. In Manhattan, Mrs. Corine S. Baker, parks chairman for community board 10, covering Central Harlem, showed a visitor a former playground near the site of the cancelled Columbia gymnasium project in Morningside Park at 114th Street. It looked as though it had suffered a direct bombing hit. Uptown, at the corner of Colonial Park at Bradhurst Avenue and 155th Street, stairs that are barred at the top, “to insure public safety,” according to a sign, have tall weeds growing through the cracks. Yellowed papers strewn over the glass‐covered sand blow in the wind. Not all the parks share the same unhappy fate. Mount Morris Park in Harlem, for example, appears well kept with its rakish new recreation building. The Parks Department says it has appointed GO three‐man fix‐it teams and has put 40 more men on longer‐term spruce‐up crews to cope with the vandalism and deterioration.

970-> Fourth of Texas Eligible For U.S. Aid in Drought
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters)—About a quarter of Texas was declared eligible for special disaster relief today because of a drought believed to be the worst since the mid‐nineteen‐fifties. The interim relief action was ordered by President Nixon and announced by Agriculture Secretary Clifford M. Hardin. It applies to 89 of the state's counties and will enable eligible farmers to get cut‐price feed grains from Government‐held stocks. The Agriculture Department said the drought affected mostly cattle ranchers and dryland winter wheat, which accounts for almost 90 per cent of the state's winter wheat.

971-> These Models Seek Beauty in the Ghetto
ATLANTA (UPI) — Twice a week two Atlanta models step from the world of high fashion to that of runaways school delinquents and other youngsters in trouble with the law. Barbara Fuch, a highly‐paid black model and director of Peachtree Center Modeling Agency Inc., and Bonnie Reeve president and part‐owner of the agency want to instill pride in the girls who for one reason or another wound up at the Atlanta Development Center. Mrs. Fuch 29 a college graduate with both New York and Atlanta modeling experience said, “I see these little children on the streets and underneath all the dirt and grime I can see they're beautiful and that's what I try to bring out.” “What does a model do really except pose for pictures?” Miss Reeve said. “There has to be something else.” Mrs. Fuch, who also had been an assistant public rela tions director for Economic Opportunity Atlanta joined the modeling agency in 1969 and proposed the idea of going into public schools and teaching self‐improvement to underprivileged students. The models spent a year in mostly‐black Atlanta schools perfecting a program to instill etiquette, good grooming habits and selfconfidence into ghetto youngsters. The Federal Government took interest and has been funding the project through its Model Cities program in four local elementary schools. Their latest project began about a month ago in the youth development center, a state school for juveniles who have committed minor offenses. Most are runaways from broken homes children who refused to attend school and a scattering of drug offenders. The models visit the center on Tuesdays and Thursdays and instruct classes of 15 young teen‐age girls. About half the students are black. To lecture the girls during the three‐hour sessions, the models have brought cosmetologists, hairstylists, barbers, drug experts. One week, Atlanta's vice‐mayor, Maynard Jackson, accompanied them. Current Social Problems After informal group discussions on sex, narcotics and current social problems, the models and that night's beauty specialist show the girls how to make themselves more attractive and how to act properly in public. “They seem so excited on the nights of the classes and they go back and tell the rest of the girls what they've learned,” said Elsie Phillips training director at the school. Some of the beauty specialists come to the school at no fee and others are paid along with two Peachtree Models staff members out of a $6,000 grant from the state. The fund is also used for beauty supplies and transportation to the school. “It's enough to break even,” said Miss Reeve. The models said if the project works out they hope to continue it next year and expand it into Georgia's prison system.

972-> SOVIET BLOC Pun BIG SEABED STUDY
MOSCOW, April 23 — In the absence of an international authority on exploitation of seabed resources, the Soviet Union and its allies have quiet ly agreed on an ambitious pro gram of surveys and extrac tion of valuable minerals found on the ocean floor.. Soviet‐bloc geologists meet ing in a four‐day conference in the Baltic Sea port of Riga have decided to set up an In ternational Coordinating Cen ter of Marine Exploration in the Soviet Union. The center, designed to in sure “rational use of mineral resources of the oceans,” will be open to members of the Council of Mutual Economic As sistance, or Comecon, the eco nomic alliance of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. According to a published in terview with G.A. Mirlin, the head of the Soviet delegation at the Riga meeting, joint ex peditions are being planned to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans to select prospective sites for mineral exploitation. Mr. Mirlin is head of the Geology and Mineral Resources Department of the State Plan ning Committee, the Soviet economic planning agency. He said exploration efforts would be directed toward finding oil and gas fields as well as deposits of gold, tin, nickel, cobalt, titanium and zirconium, all of which are limited in sup ply on the Soviet Union's land mass. The Soviet bloc acted after the United Nations General As sembly agreed last December that the seabed's riches be longed to all nations and adopted a resolution to set up an international body to direct their exploitation. The resolution provided for convening a conference on the law of the sea in 1973 to draw up the governing regulations. The conference is also to agree on a definition of the area of the seabed that would be out side national jurisdiction and fall under the proposed inter national authority. United Nations efforts to regulate the use of seabed re sources were not mentioned in published reports of the Riga conference, which was attended by delegations from Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany, Poland, Rumania and Czechoslovakia in addition to that of the Soviet Union.

973-> Bank in North Carolina Sued
WASHINGTON, June 22 (AP) —The Justice Department filed suit today against a North Car olina bank contending that an agreement it made with a shop ping center for location of a night depository was anticom petitive. The suit seeks a court order requiring the Wachovia Bank and Trust Company of Winston Salem the largest commercial bank in the state, to terminate its lease agreement with the Holly Hill Mall Shopping Cen ter in Burlington. The Government contends that the agreement prohibits similar installations at the shop ping center by other commer cial banks in restraint of trade. The effect of the agreement has been to suppress the ability of other banks to attract the deposits of the shopping cen ter's tenants said Assistant Attorney General Richard W. Mc Laren, head of the Justice De partment's antitrust division. The suit was filed in United Stateg District Court in Greens boro N. C. In Winston‐Salem N. C., a spokesman for Wachovia said that the bank was “particular ly shocked” at the Justice De partment's action. The bank acknowledged that the lease in quesion would in deed bar any additional bank from entering the Holly Hill shopping center (other than the two already there). But Wachovia asserted that all the banks operating in that area had “the same opportunity as Wachovia to negotiate the same type of lease Wachovia has.” The bank said that the lease in question was a type that was “common all over the country,” and was completely lawful under North Carolina and Fed eral statutes. “We know of no similar action that has ever been taken by the Department of Justice,” the bank asserted, “against a lease to operate a bank office or any other type of business facility in a shopping center.”

974-> Screen:‘Projectionist’
Although you may have been expecting somebody sur real, out of Kafka or Borges, the hero of “The Projection ist,” which opened yesterday at the Kips Bay, is a guy who shows movies in a Manhattan theater. Unlike others of his profession, who are content to pass their happy hours in neglecting reel‐change clues, misframing, ignoring focus, forgetting to trim their car bons, and failing to adjust their sound level, this pro jectionist also projects him self into the movies. So he is really not so far from the flights of Kafka or Borges or H. Rider Haggard or other great masters of the imagi nation. By night a fat, mild‐man nered projectionist (Chuck McCann), he becomes by day (or whenever his attention wanders, which, in keening with his chosen life's work, is pretty often) the amazing Captain Flash, fat defender of a scientific mastermind (Jara Kohut) and his much‐men aced beautiful young daugh ter (Ina Balin). Opposed to Captain Flash stands The Bat (Rodney Dangerfield), who in real life manages the theater in which Captain Flash pro jects and the scientific mas termind sells candy. • This method of populating fantasies has its obvious and fairly simple appeal, and some less obvious but equal ly simple disadvantages. Per haps the greatest problem, which will have to serve for many lapses in invention and energy that keep “The Pro jectionist” from remotely realizing its potential, is in the relationship between the manager and the projection ist. “Just once I'd like to meet you when you're not in a union,” snarls the boss when ordered out of the projection booth. And indeed, what dream of omnipotence or cloak of invincibility could possibly match the staying power of Local 306? Captain Flash's adventures are intended to parody old serials, and in this they are sporadically accurate and only rarely amusing. Chuck McCann plays his projection ist as normal and his fantasy hero as a disaster, which seems a strategic mistake. But by way of compensation, in the course of the film and of the projectionist's dreams, we are provided with enough nostalgic movie clips to con stitute an instant history of the American cinema from D. W. Griffith to Busby Berkeley and Michael Curtiz and beyond. • Whatever its 400 failings, there is something to be said for a movie that is occasion ally interrupted by previews of coming attractions, that includes its own world pre miere, and that at one point (by means of back‐projec tion) even takes us into Rick's Café Americain. At the crucial climax, when The Bat almost has in his clutches the scientific wizard and his Beautiful Young Daughter, Captain Flash is able, by grace of his handy habit, to conjure up the as sistance of John Wayne, John Garfield, James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn, Flash Gordon, Ser geant York and Gunga Din— among others. You may ima gine the outcome. “The Projectionist” was written, produced and di rected by Harry Hurwitz, who also co‐stars as the Friendly Usher. The press notes say that Mr. Hurwitz “spent the past five years planning and executing this film.” I should like to ima gine those as years of fe vered creativity, inspired by a lifetime subscription to Film Fan Monthly and sus tained by endless boxes of Goober's Milk‐ Chocolate Coated Peanuts.

975-> CHICAGO'S BLACKS VEXED BY TRANSIT
CHICAGO, May 8—The Chicago metropolitan area possesses one of the most efficient and comfortable commuter systems in the nation—provided the commuter follows the usual pattern of traveling from the suburbs to the inner city. But, according to the Chicago Urban League, for a black worker who has to commute from his inner city neighborhood to a job in the suburbs, the system is virtually useless. As a result, blacks in the inner city areas are being cut off from the rapidly increasing number of new jobs opening up in the sections surrounding Chicago. In many instances, the study shows, the cost of getting out to these job opportunities is so high that an unemployed Negro would be better off going on welfare than paying transit fares or automobile expenses to take a job in the white suburbs. Laplois Ashford, executive director of the Chicago Urban League, said that the group had become increasingly concerned about the steady movement of jobs away from the inner city. Blacks and other disadvantaged minorities are still limited in their choice of residence and cannot easily follow these jobs to the suburbs, he said. Most New Jobs in Suburbs The Urban League's findings, based on a year's detailed study of job opportunities and transportation available to reach them, indicated that today nearly 80 per cent of all new employment in the six‐county metropolitan area is going into the suburbs. In the last 10 years, new jobs In the suburbs increased by more than 437,000, while those in the inner city were increasing only 134,000. Further, more than 90,000 jobs that had been available in the largely black South and West Sides of Chicago, were terminated. The area's rate of economic expansion has outpaced the national rate, and the area had a lower unemployment rate in 1970 than the national average of 4.9 per cent. Unemployment among whites was 3.3 per cent and among blacks, 5.4 per cent. April unemployment in the area was 4.4 per cent, while the national rate was 6.1 per cent. Nationally, black unemployment rose, to 10 per cent; this rate for Chicago was not available. In the last 10 years more than 505,000 whites have moved to the suburbs. But Chicago's black population, which rose from 22.9 to 32.6 per cent in that period, remained in Negro neighborhoods. Blacks living in the suburbs increased from 2.9 to 3.5 per cent. The league's study noted that there was virtually no low‐cost housing available in the suburbs near the new industries and that there was little prospect of any being built soon. The study also described the almost total lack of information in the black community about job opportunities in the suburbs. It cited instances where suburban employers had declined to hire Negro applicants who could not assure them that they had reliable means of transportation. It said: “The lack of a distribution system between suburban rail stations and job sites makes virtually the entire suburban rail and bus system useless to the potential reverse commuter employe. This is true even in the many instances where jobs are available in plants that may be within a mile or two of suburban rail stations.” While many of the suburban jobs could feasibly be reached from the black areas of Chicago by automobile, the study noted that only from 10 to 20 per cent of Chicago's blacks were able to afford automobiles. Even with an automobile, the cost of driving it to work could be too great for an unskilled worker, in Chicago, it said. Routes Called Confusing Finally, when public transportation routes do exist to suburban employment areas, the combination of subway, bus and train needed to get there is so slow and confusing that many black workers could not manage, the study concluded. For example, for a black to commute from the Cabrini housing project in Chicago to a job at the Weston Atomic Accelerator project in the suburb of West Chicago, 33 miles away, would require an hour and 20 minutes each way by subway and commuter train or up to an hour by car. The public transportation fares would cost $59 per month, and for a single driver to operate an automobile it would cost at least $174 a month, not including tolls, the league said. The Urban League recommended that employers and Government agencies join in providing a simpler means of getting to and from the suburbs. It suggested that employers could provide economical bus transportation between their plants and areas in the black neighborhoods. It also noted that the Federal Department of Transportation had money for demonstration grants to subsidize special rail and bus service routed and timed to carry black reverse commuters to suburban jobs.

976-> Goldwater Denounces Proposals to Curb President's War Powers
WASHINGTON, April 23 — Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today that proposals to impose legis lative restrictions on the Presi dent's warmaking powers were “improper, unwise and perhaps illegal.” As a leader of Republican conservatives, Senator Goldwa ter has frequently criticized the concentration of domestic pow ers in the Presidency. But he argued today that in foreign policy, particularly in the au thority to make war, the Presi dent has constitutional powers that “have never been ques tioned.” He also warned that any Con gressional interference with the President's powers as Comman der in Chief could “utterly de molish” the nation's “dependa bility as an ally.” Senator Goldwater raised the first serious objections to vari ous bills being considered by the committee that would limit the President's ability to com mit troops to foreign hostilities without Congressional consent. The Goldwater action raised a question in the committee whether the legislation would run into serious resistance from conservatives and perhaps from the Administration. Near the end of his testimony, Senator Goldwater said that “I think we have finally jarred the State Department to make a presentation against the legis lation.” The Senator's objections centered on a bill by Senator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York, that has become the focus for the favorable con sideration that the Foreign Re lations Committee is giving legislation on war powers. Under the bill, the President, in the absence of a declara tion of war, could not under take foreign hostilities except to repel an attack on the Unit ed States or on American troops abroad, to protect the lives of Americans abroad or to comply with a treaty com mitment. Even in such cases, the President could not con tinue the military action for more than 30 days without Congressional approval. The Javits bill, Senator Gold water contended, would “leave the United States helpless to prevent the annihilation of Is rael,” would “emascualte NATO,” would “unwittingly al low a military Congress to ini tiate a nuclear holocaust” and “may incite one of the gravest constitutional crises in Ameri can history.” Senator Javits protested that Senator Goldwater understood neither the provisions of his bill nor the division of war powers between the Presidency and Congress that was intended under the Constitution. Answering the objection that the bill would prohibit an im mediate response to forestall conquest of Israel, Senator Ja vits said that the President would have authority to inter vene to protect the lives of American nationals. As for the objection that the bill would “undermine the credibility” of the American commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Or ganization, he observed that the President could act to pre vent an attack against Ameri can troops. Furthermore, he continued, under the NATO treaty mem hers were committed to act “in accordance with their respec tive constitutional processes.” To Senator Javits, this meant the President would have to seek Congressional authority, as required under his bill, for sustained hostilities. But Sen ator Goldwater interpreted the treaty to mean that the Presi dent could act without Congres sional authority. As Senator Goldwater con tinued to raise objections, Sen ator Javits finally said: “You are opposed to this bill be cause you have less faith in Congress than you have in the Presidency.” “To be quite frank, you are right,” Senator Goldwater re plied. When Senator Clifford P. Case, Republican of New Jersey, said “you really believe we should have a dictator for for eign policy,” Senator Goldwater said that he did not think the President should have exclusive warmaking powers but that there should be a partnership between the Presidency and Congress. If there is to he a clarifying of the war powers of the Presi dency and Congress, he said, it should be done by a con stitutional amendment rather than by legislation.

978-> In Bustling Shanghai, Growth Is Outward
SHANGHAI, April 22—The Chinese Communist Govern ment has clearly concen trated attention on the sub urbs, factories and rural areas attached to Shanghai rather than to the old inner core left from the era of for eign rule. Only an occasional new building is to be seen in the former In ternational Set tlement and the former French Concession. The old structures, shabby and begrimed, still serve as offices, dormitories, workers' clubs, stores full of utilitarian goods, warehouses and schools. Not a bourgeois touch remains. Central Shanghai may look run down, but the outer areas present a newer, clean er, more dynamic aspect. New factories ring the city, many spewing coal smoke that is causing a smog problem, and many new worker's apart men buildings and spruced up old single‐family dwellings stand amid trees and parks. Farther out each of five satellite communities of apartment buildings in garden settings houses some 20,000 people and provides man power for nearby industrial plants. New paved highways lead beyond into fields lush with flowering rapeseed—for the city's cooking oil—wheal, barley, clover, beans, cabbage and melons, and on into the area of the collective farms, where peasant communities that are part of the Shanghai complex produce what the city eats. The suburbs and the rural areas, like the central city, swarm with people, all dressed roughly alike, all working or playing at the same mass, group‐activity level. But in the suburbs and rural areas life seems more cheerful, more open, more relaxed. Everywhere, downtown and out of town, youth is on the move. About the most com mon sight is marching col umns of youngsters and teen agers, packs on their backs, heading off somewhere for physical and military training. Visiting newsmen were never quite able to learn just what the marching columns did at their destinations. Work in the fields? Pitch camp? The reply was always “They are just training” or “They are just marching.” The marchers added to the congestion of millions of pedestrians and cyclists in this swarming city, which has a metropolitan popula tion of about 10 million, the largest in China. A system of staggered (lays off for workers insures that there are always crowds in public places, and night work requires that some shops and public transportation func tion. Brightening the teeming but otherwise dull spectacle were great portraits of Mr. Mao that hang everywhere, huge posters heralding per formances of ballet and new style opera and placards por traying husky uniformed sol diers on guard at frontiers as well as Maoist quotations in man‐high lettering on almost every wall. The massive Bank of China's Bund headquarters, built when T. V. Soong and his brother‐in‐law, H. H. Kung, dominated the finances of the Kuomintang regime in the nineteen‐thirties, is still the Bank of China, but Mr. Soong would never recognize the bizarre mingling of bank ing with politics. Scores of placards bearing the thoughts of Chairman Mao Tse‐tung dangle from twine strung be tween pillars and walls, a great portrait of the chair man beams from the back of the main hall, and posters and bulletin boards proclaim the themes of the “struggle‐criticism ‐ transfor mation” campaign going on among the bank staff. Still the liveliest corner of the downtown area is the department store complex at the upper end of Nanking Road, which, as in the old days, draws teeming masses to its four multistoried em poriums. The biggest, former ly Wing On and now Shang hai No. 1 Department Store, retains an aspect of glitter, but its stocks of luxury goods from all over the world have given way to utilitarian items entirely of domestic manu facture. The international group of journalists that has been vis iting China, ostensibly in con nection with tours by foreign table tennis teams, has in fact been permitted to func tion separately, and most of its members have paid little attention to the games. They have looked into con ditions in a rural collective, in factories, among workers and their dependents, and in a hospital and have been able to talk with individuals in many walks of life, but they did not succeed in see ing the officials who run the city administration. A request for a meeting with Chang Chun‐chiao or some other member of the revolutionary committee that governs Shanghai drew the response that they were too busy. The visitors had no con tacts with people ‐except through interpreters on con ducted tours to places regularly shown to foreigners.

979-> Attica Told to Start Hearings On Segregation by Tomorrow
BUFFALO, Dec. 14 — Judge John T. Curtin of United States District Court here Is ordered the superintendent of the Attica State Correctional Facility to begin administrative hearings by Thursday afternoon for 38 prisoners who have been segregated from the rest of the prison population since the Sept. 9‐to‐13 riot there. The judge also issued a separate injunction prohibiting state authorities from physical abuse or torture of the prisoners. In a 14‐page decision signed yesterday afternbon, Judge Curtin found that the 38 prisoners, all of whom are believed to have been active participants in the riot, in which 43 persons died, are being held in segregation in violation of the due‐process clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution and in violation of the rules of the State Corrections Department. He ordered Vincent R. Mancusi, the prison superintendent, to schedule meetings for the 38 before the prison's adjustment committee and to make weekly reports to the court on the progress of the committee's proceedings. The committee, which Is supposed to meet at least once a week with any prisoner in special confinement, can order that the confinement be continned or can recommend a hearing before the prison superintendent. The judge's order permits the prisoners to be continued in segregated confinement during the committee's proceedings. Several inmates had testified before Judge Curtin that they were beaten, forced to run a gantlet of guards and otherwise abused shortly after the riot was put down. Judge Curtin refused last Oct, 6 to issue such an injunction, because he had held that there was no evidence that the alleged beatings were contining, However the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed his decision and directed him to issue the injunction, which he signed today.

980-> Notes on People
In 1958, Mrs. Richard M. Nixon, as wife of the Vice President, swung and missed twice with a bottle of champagne that was supposed to christen a Caribbean cruise ship. Yesterday, in the same shipyard at Newport News, Va., preparing to christen the U.S.S. California, Mrs. Nixon almost bobbled the bubbly again. But as the California, a 596‐foot, 10,000‐ton nuclear frigate started slipping into the water ahead of schedule, the First Lady lashed out with the wine, a California champagne, and it splashed across the California's bow. “I knew I'd make it,” she said. “There were supposed to be three whistles. There were only two, and my goodness, the ship was going down into the water. The bottle exploded. It was marvelous.” An announced supporter of the crew‐cut for United States Marines, Leonard F. Chapman Jr., Marine Corps Commandant, said he wanted no shaggy‐haired ex‐captains back in the Corps — even ones like Secretary of the Navy John H. Chafee. Secretary Chafee, who outranks General Chapman, wears his hair longish and has sideburns. Referring to the Secretary's locks, during an inspection tour at Quonset Naval Air Station, Rhode Island, the Commandant said, “No, we're not going to, begin that in the Marine Corps. If he wants to go back into the Marines, he'll have to get a haircut.” In an interview in Monte Carlo, Princess Grace said she agreed with some aspects of women's liberation, but not all—especially abortion. The Princess, a Roman Cath. olic, had much more to say on another aspect of womanhood: “It's a capital ques tion. Modern life makes it difficult for many young women to breast feed their children. The Leche League is there to help them persevere in their want to do so.” The band struck up “Hello, Lyndon” and it obviously pleased former President Johnson, as he arrived at a McAllen, Tex., dinner for Representative Eligio de la Garza. As he waved to the crowd, Mr. Johnson said, “A man in public life needs a little appreciation now and then. I speak from experience.” Follow up: about a quarter of a century ago this time of the year, Arnold Tucker was the quarterback for Army who handed the football to the nation's most famous college players, Felix (Doc) Blanchard and Glenn Davis.

Mr. Andretti nodded affirmatively. Then Mr. Nixon offered a homily on racing and politics: “Politics is a competitive business, too. The better your opponent, the better you have to do.” Then, inviting the drivers into the House for a visit, the President said, “We'll see that nobody steals the cars.” Patrolman James Elder of the Omaha police was hunting deer when he saw two men drop a garbage bag and run into a cornfield.

981-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: Edward Suizberger says the landlords need “relief.” Mr. Sulzberger's letter (Nov. 12) shows clearly why there is such a divergence in the landlord‐tenant philosophy. Landlords want socialism for themselves, but demand that the relief they seek from “tax burdens” not be shared with their tenants. Landlords insist that the free enterprise system and the doctrine of laissez faire must continue to operate vis‐à‐vis their tenants and their properties. The threat to abandon residential housing no longer frightens tenants, although it may frighten the tax department of the City of New York. Tenants have learned how to manage their buildings in the course of conducting rent strikes, and truly landlords are extraneous in the last few years of the twentieth century. Furthermore, the concept that rent control and abandonment are twins was destroyed with the publication of the Urban League's study, showing New York to be fifth in the list of abandoned housing, and the only city with rent control. We do not want socialism for landlords or for Lockheed. Our experience has convinced us that there can no longer be a real estate “industry.” The solution is public ownership of all housing, with tenant control. New York, Nov. 12, 1971

983-> 2 Youth‐Program Workers Held in Narcotics Case
Two former college basket ball players — who worked for the city this summer run ning sports programs in the slums and warning youngsters to avoid drugs — were arrest ed yesterday and charged with possessing and trying to sell four ounces of pure heroin for $4,000. According to the police, they worked for the Youth Services Agency. They were accused of trying to sell the heroin to an undercover agent. The arrested men were iden tified as Solomon McMillan, 24 years old, of 193‐09 119 Avenue, St. Albans, Queens, and John.Busby, 24, of 110‐18 Fran cis Lewis Boulevard, Queens Village. Mr. McMillon was said to be a supervisor in the program and a graduate of Loyola Uni versity of Chicago. Mr. Busby, according to the police, played basketball at J. C. Smith Uni versity in North Carolina. The police, members of the special investigating unit of the department's Narcotics Division said an arrangements was made by their undercover man with the two suspects, to sell the heroin. Under the arrangement, they said, the two men arrived in a car at Linden and Springfield Boulevards, in the Springfield Gardens section of Queens, and the undercover man met them and told them to drive around the corner. There they were stopped by Lieut. John J. Hill, Sgt. Norman Cohen and Detectives James Cottile, Carl Grillo and Louis Martinez. They said they found a glassine envelope on the front seat of the car between the two men, whom they arrested. They estimated that, when cut, it might have brought $75,000.

984-> U.S. Raid in North Vietnam May Have Damaged 2 MIG's
SAIGON, Saturday, April 24 —An attack by United States Navy jets on enemy antiaircraft defenses at the Quanlang air field in North Vietnam Thurs day afternoon “may have dam aged one or two MIG‐21 aircraft located on the ground near the site,” the United States com mand announced this morning. Navy officers here said that a photograph taken by one of the pilots showed that black smoke was coming from one of the fighter planes and pos sibly from a second one The attack, 50 miles west northwest of Vinh, was against surface‐to‐air missile and gun sites from which a Navy re connaisance aircraft had been fired at, spokesmen said. The command said that there were no reports of any MIG planes of the North Vietnamese Air Force in the air at the time of the raid, which was what the military authorities call “pro tective reaction.” There have been five such raids in North Vietnam and Laos so far this week, the largest number in any week since the regular bombing of North Vietnam was halted in November, 1968.

986-> Aid to the Campuses
In its pre‐vacation rush, the Senate cleared the most extensive measure ever proposed to aid higher educa tion. The $16‐billion authorization points the way toward substantial subsidies for students and institutions. promises to avert a disastrous decline in the economic and academic strength of America's colleges. The fiscal gloom which currently envelopes campus leadership is a matter of deep national concern. It would be unconscionable if, at the very moment when adequate consideration is at last given to the collegiate aspirations of the poor and the racial minorities, the combined im pact of recession, inflation and slashed research funds were to force admissions officers once again to make ability‐to‐pay the requirement for entry. Nevertheless, when Congress returns Sept. 8, the House will have to address itself realistically to a refinement of the Senate's largesse. Great as is the need of the colleges and universities for aid, the Federal investment must serve the cause of improving higher education, not merely shore up an embalmed status quo. Nothing could be less productive than holding out hope that institu tions will be aided, regardless of their capacity for self improvement. The Federal dollar ought to be a stimulus for quality and public service, instead of a crutch for uncertain leadership. The most effective formula for aiding students as well as institutions is that proposed originally by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education and subsequently adopted by Representative John Brademas of Indiana—extensive Federal grants and loans to needy students, with additional cost‐of‐education subsidies payable the colleges in which these students are enrolled. This approach offers maximum freedom of choice to the student, while rewarding the institution for doing its share in educating the less affluent. It would be unrealistic, however, to ignore the fact that some colleges are in danger of financial collapse. Prixvisions will have to be made for Federal aid on short‐term emergency basis under criteria designed assure that such subsidies will not simply delay the demise of ineffective institutions or perpetuate academic deficiencies. The goal of any new program of Federal subsidy must be to strengthen the underpinnings and lift the quality of higher education.

987-> RANKIN TO GIVE UP HIS LAW PRACTICE
A special three‐man commit tee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York recommended yesterday that Corporation Counsel J. Lee Rankin give up his limited pri vate practice of law. The committee concluded that the city's top lawyer was not guilty of “unethical action” and that his legal practice did not involve a conflict of inter est with his city job. However, as $40,000‐a‐year head of the city's Law Department, the committee said, Mr. Rankin's private practice “seems inap propriate.” Mr. Rankin announced imme diately that he was giving up his limited private legal activi ties. He also said he would remove this name from the tele phone directory under the list ing of “attorney” and have his name removed from his office door at 36 West 44th Street and from the building's direc tory. When Mr. Rankin's outside legal work became known sev eral weeks ago, he requested that Bernard Botein, president of the bar association, appoint a committee to examine the Corporation Counsel's private legal activities. Mr. Botein named Arthur H. Dean chairman of the commit tee and Ernest Gross and Frank W. Ford Jr. as members. In its report, the committee said it had questioned Mr. Ran kin extensively on the nature of his private practice. The committee said that Mr. Rankin had told them the following: ¶That he never talked with or Saw, his private clients in his Corporation Counsel's office in the Municipal Building (his cli ents, he said, were drawn from his former private practice in Nebraska). ¶That his advice to them had no relation to city matters. ¶That he never appeared in court for these clients. ¶That his attorney activities were minimal and occupied a small part of his free time. Mr. Rankin, who became Corporation Counsel in 1966, said he had rented office space for private practice in 1965 and had held on to it for the time when he would leave city gov ernment. He added that he had accepted fees during his first year as Corporation Counsel and that they amounted to less than $1,500. The committee found that Mr, Rankin's activities “do in dicate a departure from the standards of Section 1100 of the City Chatter,” which pro vides that every head of a city department, except a Council man, shall “give his whole time to his duties and shall not en gage in any other occupation, profession or employment.”

988-> Satellite Is Sent Into Orbit Trailing Solar Power Cell
VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif., Oct. 17 (UPI)—A scientific satellite with a 32‐ foot‐long solar power cell that unwound like a window shade was launched into polar orbit today atop a Thor‐Agena rocket. The satellite, which achieved orbit in the upper atmosphere, will radio information back to earth for at least six months on high energy particles, solar power production, the effect of sun storms on polar phenom ena, satellite communications and celestial sphere measure ments. Lockheed Missiles & Space Company, the prime contractor, said the largest experiment was a 250‐pound solar array capable of producing 1,500 watts of electrical power from the sun's energy. The 32‐by‐6‐foot power cell was rolled up in a cylinder at launching and unrolled when the satellite reached orbit. The array has a pointing system to keep it always facing the sun for maximum power output.

989-> Pires Stops Burton in 7th Round Here
Willie Burton, a Bronx heavyweight, carried a record of 21 victories in 23 fights into the Felt Forum ring last night. His only loss since turning pro was to the huge Brazilian, Luis Faustino Pires of Sao Paulo, in Madison Square Garden in Octo‐, ber of 1969. Burton made a valiant try in their return match before crowd of 1,955 fans. But he failed again, losing on a technical knockout at 2:47 of the seventh round. Pires, who had a 22‐pound weight edge, floored Burton in the first minute of the first round with a solid left hook. Burton wobbled to his feet at the count of six and weathered the rest of the round. Then in the sixth round, Pires unleashed a withering attack that had Burton on rubbery legs for almost the full three minutes. The savage beating also turned some of the Burton rooters into an angry mood. There were shouts of “Stop the fight! Stop it!” But Barney Felix, the referee, permitted Pires to continue his relentless assault. Burton never left his feet al though he was a stumbling target for the hard‐hitting Brazilian. A couple of empty paper beer cups soared into the ring between the sixth and seventh rounds and the Forum guards had to get some of the angrier fans back to their seats. Fires finally finished the job in the seventh round. He nailed Burton with a hard hook, then smashed Burton through the lower ring ropes onto his back. Felix did not even count. He signaled that the fight was Over.

990-> CHILEAN EX‐AIDE SLAIN BY GUNMEN
SANTIAGO, Chile, June 8 — Ambushers firing submachine guns killed today a former min ister who was an outspoken antileftist politician. Shortly after the slaying President Salvador Allende Gossens clamped a state of emergency on Santiago Prov ince and put military units on alert throughout the country. He asserted that the killing had been deliberately staged to cre ate “an atmosphere of chaos.” The state of emergency per mits policemen to make some arrests without warrant, allows press censorship and suspends some individual rights. Under the provisions, which can be maintained legally for six months, a curfew from mid night to 6 A.M. was also im posed. The victim, Edmundo Pérez Zukovic, 57 years old, who as Minister of Interior was respon sible for internal security under the previous government, was hit by five bullets. It was the second political assassination here in seven months. Gen. René Schneider Chereau, commander of the army, was ambushed and fatally wounded Oct. 22, just after the election in which Dr. Allende, a Marxist, was victorious. Witnesses told the police that three men in a car blocked Mr. Pérez Zukovic's car as he left his home about 10:30 A.M. They fled after the shooting. The victim's daughter, Angel ica Maritzi, who was with him and was uninjured, got help from a woman passer‐by and they drove the dying man to Chile's military hospital a few blocks away. Detectives said she related that she had told her father, “Get out your re volver because they are follow ing us!” He replied, “But I don't have a pistol.” Mr. Pérez Zukovic was con sidered to be in the Christian Democratic party's right wing. As Interior Minister from 1967 to 1969 he was the target of bitter criticism from the six leftist groups now in Dr. Al lende's coalition. They held him responsible for a bloody clash between policemen and home less squatters in 1969. Dr. Allende's Interior Min ister, Jose Toha, told the press that “the political affiliation of the authors of this crime has been identified,” but he refused to give details. The Christian Democratic party demanded that army in telligence, not the police, han dle the investigation of the death. In a harshly worded statement, it said it “lacked con fidence in the civilian police.” The police said they had ar rested a man named Ronaldo Rivera Calderon in connection with the slaying. They did not give his political affiliation or other details. The woman who helped drive Mr. Perez Zukovic to the hos pital, a motorist and two stu dents were being held for ques tioning. In a nationwide radio‐televi sion address, Dr. Allende said the slaying was “a deliberate provocation intended to alter the institutional life of the country.” Latin America's first freely elected Marxist President, he has promised to use democratic methods to bring socialism to Chile. “I reiterate categorically that I will maintain democracy and liberty,” he said. “I will fulfill without vacillation my duty to maintain order, internal peace and the law.” Mr. Pérez Zukovic was one of the most prominent members of the Christian Democratic right wing, which backed Dr. Eduardo Frei Montalva in con frontations with left‐wing radi cals and Marxist‐led labor unions during his presidency. Mr. Pérez Zukovic sought to destroy the so‐called Revolu tionary Left Movement, an ex tremist group to the left of the Communist and Socialist parties, which began bank rob beries and other violent revolu tionary actions and established clandestine guerrilla training camps in 1969 and early 1970. Members of the group were released and granted amnesty by President Allende, who tried to create a basis for a political understanding that would prevent violent political actions. When General Schneider was assassinated by right‐wing ex tremists seeking to prevent Dr. Allende from taking office, the magazine Punto Final, which speaks for the Revolutionary Left Movement, said Mr. Perez Zukovic was involved. He de nied it. Since Dr. Allende took office Nov. 4, Mr. Perez Zukovic has been working against any deal between his party and the Gov ernment. The dead man had eight children.

991-> Advertising:
Gaynor & Ducas, which will he losing the Scandinavian Airlines System business, has just been named by Northeast Airlines. Northeast will be leaving Carl Ally, Inc., where it also replaced the lost S.A.S. business. The Allyites will not be left without wings, however, since they got a nice piece of the Pan American action about a year ago. Ally had aggressively gone after the Pan Am account realizing it would lose Northeast as soon as it was acquired, by Northwest. Well that merger fell through and it left Ally with two airlines that had conflicting routes in the Caribbean area. Northeast spent more than $3.5 ‐ million in measured media in 1969 but with the acquisition pending held back considerably in 1970. Its relationship with Gaynor & Ducas would not seem destined to be a long one, since industry sources say that Northeast must be acquired or else. If it is, then certainly the agency of the surviving carrier would appear to have the best chance of keeping the business. According to a Northeast spokesman the line and Ally terminated by mutual consent. Gaynor takes the assignment on May 11. He said that about 20 agencies were looking for the account, six were seriously considered and three mad it to the finals. Gaynor's credentials include South African Airways, Texas International Airlines, Thai International Airlines, British European Airways and Skyway Luggage. So they had it in the bag. Meanwhile, back in New York, five agencies are awaiting the word on which way the $2.7‐million S.A.S. account will go. It could well come next week. You might spend the time until then rereading this news and trying to figure out who did what to whom. Bell & Howell, Chicago, which recently had some top management changes, now plans to do a little changing in its advertising setup. At the moment it uses three agencies, McCann ‐ Erickson; A. J. Rosenthal, and CreamerColarossi, a division of Coordinated Communications, Inc. It only wants one. Although it spends less than $2‐million a year on advertising, Anthony R. Cangemi, the former New York agency man, who is now vice president of the marketing services department says, it plans to spend “a lot more” next year. He said that, while the three incumbent agencies have an inside track on getting the total package, “four or five” other shops have been invited to pitch. McCann has consumer products, the biggest piece, while Rosenthal has business equipment, and C.C. has a West Coast electronic company. No doubt you'll all be happy to hear that the Information Services section of Interpublic's Marschalk Company, following a complete reorganization, has been renamed the Research Department. It is being headed by Ron Nelson, formerly of Alfred Politz Research, who in his short time at the agency has already devised the Marschalk Advertising Refiner, which is called MAD. Because it's been judged successful journalistically and as far as advertiser response goes, The New York Times has decided to make its Brooklyn‐Queens‐Long Island section a permanent addition to the Sunday edition. Since Feb. 14, additional news of Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau and Suffolk prepared by the Metropolitan news staff has appeared in the main news section of 400,000 copies of the ewspaper circulated in those areas. There has been an average of 33 columns of news on 24 extra pages, and a total of 400,000 total lines of new advertising in each issue. The line rate for the section is 70 cents for retail and $1.10 for national, financial and classified advertising. The Dry Dock Savings Bank, whose previous campaignS have played up the assets of the area it serves, will next month introduce print and radio ads that talk about the problems of “Dry Dock Country” and ask readers for solutions. Created by Geer, duBois, the first ad will appear in The New York Times and New York magazine in mid May and having laid out the traffic, litter and air pollution situation of the city, it goes on to promise wide publicity for good ideas to straighten them out. A blank will be provided. Solutions will be judged by the bank and civic organizations, and the bank will provide one of its own by giving away plastic garbage bags. How nice can you get? And while we're on the subject of bags, did you hear that Warren E. Abrams of the Hudson Paper Corporation has been elected president of the Paper Bag Institute? You might remember him as, the past president of the Gummed Industries Association. Encouraged by the sales of its “ready‐to‐eat vitamin‐fortified” Total, General Mills is now introducing Corn Total, with, as one might expect, a total advertising effort. Television, which like all the rest of the advertising has been done by Dancer‐Fitzgerald‐Sample, will break on April 26 on daytime and nighttime network. The message—to be picked up later in print in national magazines and Sunday supplements —will be “each ounce provides 100 per cent of the minimum daily adult requirements of vitamins and iron” which is the same theme as the original wheat Total. How does that sound Mr. Choate? As a volunteer effort, Chalek & Dryer has prepared a campaign for the SOAR project of the Boy Scouts of America. SOAR stands for Save Our American Resources and according to the agency, such well known advertisers as McDonald's hamburger stands, Consolidated Edison, Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola and Reynolds Aluminium, will put some of their budgets behind the campaign. Both print and broadcast advertising has been prepared. So SOAR. Marsteller is getting its two cents into the agency media department versus independent media‐service feud. It has done so by publishing a 16‐page booklet entitled, “Media —The Marsteller Approach” which they're letting go for nothing. Just call or write. Southwest Airlines, to the Bloom Agency, Dallas. William R. Booth and David L. Moulds have been elected vice presidents of Ted Bates & Co., New York.

992-> EUROPE'S BANKERS REJECT U.S. STAND
BASEL, Switzerland, June 14—The trans‐Atlantic debate over the dollar sharpened today as a strong body of European monetary opinion apparently rejected Washington's assertions that it was up to the other industrialized countries to help the United States economically. The Europeans spoke from the forum of the Bank for International Settlements—an institution noted for its con, servatism—of which the United’ States is not a member. The 41st annual report of this central bankers’ central bank and a special statement by its board chairman, Jelle Zijlstra of the Netherlands, said the monetary system was in a process of fundamental change. Their basic point was that the roles of the dollar, as a domestic and at the same time as an international currency, were incompatible and that something would have to give. Basic Currency “The dollar cannot remain the basic currency of the system if the United States does not participate fully in the adjustment process,” said Mr. Zijlstra, who is also head of the Dutch national bank. He underscored that the problem of dollars piling up abroad because of repeated United States balance‐of‐payments deficits “has to be resolved and essentially by the United States.” Secretary of the Treasury John B. Connally Jr. and Secretary of State William P. Rogers have told the Europeans that they must help the United States economically because of American commitments to defend Western Europe and the rest of the “free world.” The dollar deficits, Mr. Rogers has said, are more than accounted for by American overseas defense spending. In their assessment the European monetary authorities completely ignored the defense issue. Domestic Primacy In the annual report, the new B.I.S. general manager, Rend Larre, a former high French Treasury official, said: “The continuous piling up of official short‐term debt by the United States and contention that other currencies rather than the dollar have the main responsibility for the adjustment process can hardly be the last words on the subject.” Essentially, as the Europeans see it, it is not sound to have a monetary system founded on the currency of a single country. This is because of what they see, and American authorities themselves have recognized, as the inevitable primacy of domestic over international considerations in managing the currency. To prevent a dollar outflow the United States should have high short‐term interest rates. But high rates could stifle business expansion and keep unemployment exceptionally high. The Nixon Administration has repeatedly said it would not engineer high rates to help the dollar abroad. The Europeans take the Administration at its word. At the same time they have their own special political problems as result of the dollar influx. This is the reason why one high B.I.S. official said privately to newsmen today that the situation was “precarious.” In the report itself the B.I.S. took President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers to task for suggesting that unilateral policy action by the United States would not eliminate American balance‐of‐payments deficits so long as other countries continued to run surpluses in their national accounts. ‘Spirit of Bretton Woods’ “This attitude,” the report said, “seems to be far removed from the spirit — and the letter — of Bretton Woods.” It was at the long conference of the wartime United Nations at Bretton Woods, N.H., in 1944 that the present monetary system was carved out. The unusually frank language in this year's report only underscored the growing differences between the United States and Europe in the monetary field. Ironically, much of the 194page report was prepared by an American who has lived many years in Europe. He is Milton Gilbert, the B.1.S. economic adviser. Mr. Zijlstra said that while the basic monetary debate went on the central banks of the major nations, including the United States, were trying to “provide guidance and supervision” for the growing international dollar market. The size of the market last year was placed by the B.I.S. at $46‐billion, up from $37‐billion in 1969. Placement of Funds The B.I.S. chairman said that one of the decisions already taken by the central bankers was to stop temporarily the placement of the official funds in the market and even to withdraw funds when such action was prudent. Central banks’ of Europe,’ either through the services of the B.I.S. or individually, have been placing their surplus dollars in the Eurodollar market because yields here were higher than for dollars in New York. That practice has the dangerous effect of strongly inflating the world's money supply. The B.I.S. has placed about $3‐billion of central‐bank funds in the Eurodollar market. Mr. Zijlstra's statement means that the B.I.S. will now manage these funds to guide interest rates in a way that would decrease the potential of massive monetary flows. Currency Revaluations It was such flows that caused the recent monetary disturbances in which four European, currencies had their values changed. The report said ominously that the May crisis was the first in recent years in Which basic imbalances in interna‐1 tional payments—that is those involving goods, services and long‐term capital—were not the direct cause of the flare‐up. Instead, the cause was the sloshing around of so many surplus dollars. The B.I.S. also reported significant amount of direct lending by American banks to corporations this year, in an apparent circumvention of United States exchange controls.

994-> MAYE WARNS CITY ON NEGOTIATIONS
The president of the Uni formed Firefighters Association warned yesterday of the pos sibility of “more drastic ac tion” than the strict following of rules by firemen unless the city made some moves to meet the union's contract demands. A union spokesman said that firemen manning apparatus re sponding to alarms were stop ping for red lights and at “stop” and “yield” signs, in ac cordance with a 1969 depart mental regulation. Fire trucks answering alarm's usually do not come to a full stop when the way appears to be clear. Michael J. Maye, the head of the 11,300‐member firemen's association, said that firemen throughout the city were ad hering strictly to rules and reg ulations. That adherence, which began Wednesday night, had been described originally as a “rule‐book slowdown,” but spokesman for Fire Com missioner Robert O. Lowery said yesterday, that there had been no departure from the normal pattern of operations. Fire union sources suggested, however, that firemen might increase their pressure on the city by refusing to take out apparatus that was in disrepair or that they considered un safe for operation. There were also reports that firemen at some stations were discussing the use of some con certed “sick action” against the city next week. Efforts to assess the impact of the announced rule‐book ob servance failed to turn up evi dence yesterday of any slow down in firemen's responses to alarms. By late yesterday aft ernoon, for example, the men of Engine Company 232 had an swered 15 calls throughout their territory, the Bedford Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. “There's been no slowdown here,” said Lieut. George Var rett. “These men are all volunteers and when the bell rings, they go.” The men sitting around the back room of the dingy fire house at 107 Watkins Street nodded in agreement. “No one is talking strike around here,” Fireman James Battillo said, “but that doesn't mean this job action won't get tougher next week.” A special impasse panel recommended earlier this week that firemen, policemen and sanitationmen be granted full pay pensions after 40 years of service. But the firemen, who now can retire at half pay after 20 years, had asked for retirement at full pay after 25 years' service. The panel also recommended a salary increase of $1,900 over 27 months, on top of a new salary base of $12,150 for fire men and policemen. That would raise the pay of first‐grade patrolmen and firemen to $14, 050 on Jan. 1, 1973. The panel's recommendation for sanitationmen would raise their pay $1,710 over the 27‐ month period, on top of a new base of $10,951, bringing their salaries up to $12,661 as of Jan. 1, 1973. The sanitationmen have re jected the recommendations. The firemen have expressed dissatisfaction with them but have note formally rejected them. The patrolmen are ex pected to give their answer next week. The city is continuing to study and analyze the costs of the proposals.

995-> Dissidence Unit Has Dossier on 14,000
WASHINGTON, April 1 — A Department of Justice intel ligence unit that has replaced an Army Intelligence detach ment as the Government's main watchman of political dis sidence has compiled computer ized dossiers on nearly 14,000 Americans. Officials in the department say that the Interdivisional Information Unit, known as I.D.I.U., concentrates on black militants, opponents of the war in Vietnam and New Left advo cates of overthrow of the na tion's political and economic system. But it also maintains dossiers on elected political officials and moderates who are thought to condone or stimulate civil disobedience. One official says that “anybody like that, no matter what his politics are or what his position might be, would go into the file.” In addition, the unit collects information on those con sidered right wing extremists, such as members of the John Birch Society, the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party. The official declined to re veal the specific names on file other than those publicly iden tified as agitators, such as Ren nie Davis and David Lellinger, both American leftists. The operations of I.D.I.U. which was set up by former Attorney General Ramsey Clark during the Johtison Ad ministration in 1967, are an other facet of the Govern ment's increasingly pervasive collection of information about Americans. Mr. Clark could not be reached for comment. This controversial issue was recently explored by a Senate subcommittee under the direc tion of Sam J. Ervin Jr., Democrat of North Carolina. During those hearings, a former Military Intelligence of ficer, Christopher H. Pyle, testi fied that I.D.I.U. had sup planted the Army in collecting information on political dissi dence. But his testimony lacked details from official sources. The primary purpose of I.D.I.U.'s data gathering, ac cording to Robert Mardian, As sistant Attorney General in charge of internal security, is to permit the Government to make an “adequate, measured response to the civil disorders that may arise.” I.D.I.U. is particularly active now in analyzing intelligence gathered on persons likely to be involved in a series of anti war demonstrations sched uled throughout April and May. Plans for violence are receiving especially intensive scrutiny. When a civil disorder is antic ipated, or one begins un expectedly, the intelligence unit becomes a 24‐hour opera tions center to feed informa tion to Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who is responsible for planning the Government's response. The unit is headed by R. Richards Rolaap, 30 years old, a lawyer who worked with Richard G. Kleindienst, now the Deputy Attorney General, during President Nixon's 1968 election campaign. Mr. Rolaap was a special assistant to Mr. Kleindienst until several weeks ago. I.D.I.U. gets about 90 per cent of its information from the Fed eral Bureau of Investigation. The rest comes from the news media and an occasional report from the Army, the Secret Serv ice and other Federal agencies. Documents stolen from the F. B. I. office in Media, Pa., show that the bureau obtains, its information from paid and unwitting informers, local po lice departments, telephone company officials and opera tors, bank officers, postal offi cials and university registrars, plus direct F. B. I. agent obser vation and possibly by wiretap ping and electronic listening de vices. That information is screened initially for pertinence and veri fied for accuracy by the F. B. I. before being passed on to the intelligence unit. Most of it is gathered on F. B. I. initiative and only occasionally on re quest from the unit. The intelligence analysts in I.D.I.U. then review the F. B. I. reports and extract two types of information for entry into the computerized files. One per tains to persons, the other to incidents such as meetings, rallies or bombings and other acts of violence. Like the per sonal file, the incident file con tains about 14,000 entries. The analysts have no written guidelines to tell them what should go into the files but rely on their experience to make that judgment. Files are often opened on persons long before the extent of their dissenting activity becomes clear. Both the personal and inci dent files, which are cross‐in dexed, are periodically reviewed to determine whether new pat terns of dissent or disorder are discernable. One noticed re cently is a nationwide increase in interracial fights in high schools, presumably the result of greater integration. The unit publishes a weekly summary of disorders or poten tial disturbances that goes to the Attorney General and other senior officers in the Justice De partment. Copies also go to the White House, the Secret Serv ice, the Army and the Metro politan Police Department in Washington. Beyond that, the unit pre pares more sophisticated reports only for the Attorney General and the Deputy Attor ney General. Those assessments, try to predict the location and scale of forthcoming disturb ances. The unit's analysts draw on the information stored in the computer files to make their predictions. But the unit does not make policy recommenda tions on what police or Federal forces might be needed to quell an expected disorder. That judgment is made by the Attor ney General and his staff. They, in turn, pass the in formation on, on a need‐to know basis, to other Federal agencies or to local officials who are responsible for mar shaling forces to control a dis turbance. Originally an experiment initiated by Mr. Clark in the summer of 1966, I.D.I.U. started formal operations in December, 1967, after the racial disorders in Newark and Detroit that summer and the antiwar march on the Pentagon that fall. Mr. Clark, in a memo made public by Mr. Mardian, said then, that “it is imperative that the department seek to obtain the most comprehensive intelli gence possible regarding or ganized or other purposeful stimulation of domestic dissen sion, civil disorders and riots.” “To carry out these respon sibilities,” Mr. Clark wrote, “we must make full use of and con stantly endeavor to increase and refine the intelligence avail able to us, both from internal and external sources concern ing organizations and individ uals throughout the country who may play a role in either instigating or spreading disor ders or in preventing or check ing them.” The Justice Department and the F.B.I. maintained at that time, however, that they lacked the manpower and funds to mount the intelligence opera tion on the scale ordered by Mr. Clark. Therefore, according to Mr. Mardian in recent testimony be fore Senator Ervin's subcom mittee, President Johnson in structed the Army to do the job. That resulted in the wide ranging Continental United States Intelligence operation that blossomed in 1968. During those days, I.D.I.U. got much of its information from the Army's Counterintelli gence Analysis Detachment in the Pentagon. The rest came from the F.B.I. and the news media. The unit was interested primarily in black ghettos at first but widened its focus over the years to include the entire range of dissent. In April, 1969, Robert Jor dan, the Army's general coun sel, urged Mr. Kleindienst, the Deputy Attorney General, to have the Justice Department and the F.B.I. take over the gathering of intelligence on civil disturbances. Mr. Jordan was being pressed by Army generals who wanted Military Intelligence agents to return to their regular duties of running checks for security clearances and countering threats of espionage and sabo tage aimed at military posts. But Mr. Kleindienst refused, again arguing that the Justice Department did not have the resources to run a domestic in telligence operation the size of the Army's. In 1970, however, the Army began to shut down its political surveillance after adverse pub licity had generated Congres sional criticism. In March, 1970, Mr. Jordan told Mr. Kleindienst that the Army was getting, out of the domestic intelligence business and, in effect, that if Justice wanted the information, it would have to do the col lecting itself. Consequently I.D.I.U. doubled the size of its staff so that it now his 10 analysts. The F.B.I., which had been steadily adding manpower, increased its sur veillance of dissident elements. The director of the F.B.I., S. Edgar Hoover, ordered on Nov. 4, for instance, an “in crease in both quality and quantity of intelligence infor mation on black student unions and similar groups which are targets for influence and con trol by violence‐prone Black Panther party and other ex tremists.” “Advance information on dis orders and violence is of prime importance,” Mr. Hoover said. “We must target informants and sources to develop infor mation regarding these groups on a continuing basis to fulfill our responsibilities and to de velop such coverage where none exists.” During most of its life, I.D.I.U. was under the supervi sion of the Deputy Attorney General. About a month ago it was transferred to the admin istrative control of the Internal Security Division, but it still reports operationally to Mr. Kleindienst.

996-> BRANCALEONE PLAYS DEBUSSY SMOOTHLY
As in his previous recitals here, Francis Brancaleone, who played at Tully Hall Wednes day night, showed formidable control of color and nimble technique. In the Bach Partita No. 1 in B flat, in the Liszt B minor Sonata and in excerpts from Debussy's Second Book of Prel udes and in the same compos er's Second Book of Etudes, given complete, the pianist showed a nice sense of detail and a feeling for running im petus when called for. But there were curious rhyth mic lapses at times, when the going was fast and heavy, and he was so careful with details of phrasing that over‐all sweep was occasionally lost. Sometimes, in his attention to color, he sacrificed drama. His Debussy murmured so smoothly that it seemed one de gree removed from the com poser's impressionism, rather than impressionisn itself. It was full of pastel tints but it lacked sparkle. THEODORE STRONGIN.

998-> CZECH PARTY SAYS ‘CRISIS’ HAS ENDED
PRAGUE, May 31 (AP)—The Czechoslovak Communist party made public today the final resolution of its 14th congress, which said that the long crisis had been overcome, tive Czech oslovakia was locked ?? the Soviet bloc again, but that the struggle against ?? and Western influence must be continued. The declaration, offering lit tle prospect of early relaxation, was published today in all news papers. The five‐day congress ended Saturday after the delegates had confirmed Gustav Husak as party chief and a new 115‐ member, drastically reshuffled Central Committee had been an nounced. Mr. Husak succeeded the popular reformer Alexander Dubcek as the party leader eight months after the Soviet bloc invasion of Czechoslovakia in August, 1968. “The grave crisis in the party and society has been over come,” the policy resolution de clared. But it went on to say that “right‐wing opportunism and revisionism” continued to be “the main danger we must fight against.” “The politically defeated right‐wing forces are adjusting their tactics to new conditions, they are trying to influence the thinking of part of the people to misuse our mistakes,” the statement said. “The comple tion of the defeat of the right lists in the ideological sphere is, at the present stage, an espe cially important task.” Asserting that there must be “no compromises” in ideology, the party demanded strength ening of “class‐conscious disci pline” and “struggle against all expressions of petit bour geois thinking, survival of re ligious thinking, nationalism, anti‐Sovietism and all forms of bourgeois ideology.” Reflecting party concern over Czechoslovakia's uncommitted, alienated youth, the resolution said that young people must be taught “to harbor sincere relations of friendship toward the U.S.S.R.” and all Socialist countries “so that the noble ideas of socialism and com munism will be the foundation of their conviction and world outlook.” Nothing stated during the congress offered any prospect of withdrawal of the Soviet military forces that have been in Czechoslovakia since 1968. They are thought to total 80, 000 men and, according to treaty, are here “temporarily” pending restoration of normal conditions.

1000-> Rainy and Chilly Weather Keeps Holiday Traffic at a Minimum
Thousands of the New York ers who defied poor weather reports and got away for the first “Congressionally legislated Monday Memorial Weekend,” threw in the soggy towel and came home to the city early yesterday. Swimming at Coney Island and Atlantic City was limited mostly to Polar Bear groups and an occasional photogra pher's model, and an official at Jones Beach State Park de scribed the three‐day holiday as “a bad, dreary weekend.” Port of New York Authority police said, traffic coming into the city on their bridges and tunnels was moderate at what ordinarily would be a peak traffic hour—4:30 P.M. They reported, too, that the Midtown Bus Terminal, which would have been jammed with people returning on a sunny weekend, had “light to moderate traffic.” A police sergeant at the ter minal said that what crowds there were had come through the terminal early in the after noon. By early this morning 491 persons had been killed in traffic accidents in the nation. The National Safety Council had predicted 470 traffic deaths for the 78‐hour weekend. A total of 28 persons were killed in New York State, mostly in traffic accidents and in New York City, three persons had been killed in auto mishaps. A spokesman for the Auto mobile Club of New York said that yesterday's relatively light traffic flow was anticipated. “The traffic was light leaving the city Friday,” he said. The total number of cars on local highways was expected to fall far short of the 1,250,000 figure based on good weather. The state police on the New York State Thruway and the Palisades Interstate Parkway reported that rain upstate drove many weekenders back, to the city late Sunday and ear ly yesterday, thereby eliminat ing the usual holiday weekend, congestion near the southern ends of the two highways. Traf fic moved freely southbound on both roads last evening. In part, the smaller crowds were attributed to state budget ary problems. Three beaches and four swimming and picnic areas at Bear Mountain State. Park, ordinarily open on thel Memorial Day weekend, will be closed until June 19 because of a shortage of funds. At Jones Beach, Sunken1 Meadow and Robert Moses State Parks on Long Island, the poor weather may have miti gated the effect of a lifeguards strike. Guards at the three parks stayed off the job to protest a wage cut from $5.15 to $3.49 an hour, according to a spokesman for Local 381 of the Building Service Employes Union, which represents 350 lifeguards at the three beaches. Representatives of the Long Island and Penn Central Rail roads and of the Port Authori ty's three airports reported traffic “normal” yesterday aft ernoon. However, most of them agreed that traffic was consid erably below what it would be if the weather had been better. The National Weather Serv ice here said .47 of an inch of rain fell over the weekend. Yesterday's .16 of an inch was the first measurable amount of rain here on May 31 since 1962. A Weather Service spokesman said rain had fallen here 32 times on May 31 since records were first kept in 1869. Yesterday was the first Me morial Day under a law signed by then President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 setting the hol iday permanently on the last Monday in May, instead of on May 30. At Coney Island where a full‐blooded Mohawk Indian, Chief Big Sky, did an unsuc cessful sun dance, the only at traction to report larger‐than usual crowds was the Abe Stark Recreation Center, an ice‐skating rink.

1001-> LAST OF ISLANDERS LEAVING IN PROTEST
FILICUDI, Italy, May 31 (AP) — Filicudi's doctor and telephone operator packed to day to follow the rest of the residents of this tiny island in protest against the exiling here of 15 reputed Mafia leaders. Antonio Rondo, 83 years old and ailing, and a few other elderly islanders were among the handful who remained after other residents sailed for nearby islands on Saturday. But Mr. Rondo was carried off on a stretcher over the weekend and the other elderly people went with him. Of the island's 270 inhabi tants, there remained only Dr. Rosario Federico, who had stayed to care for the sick, two teachers who had not finished packing and the island's tele phone operator and his wife. “We're leaving too,” the op erator said. “The dector, the teachers and my wife and I. We're getting out as quick as we can get a boat.” The exiles, left alone but for a few policemen to watch them, found time heavy on their hands. “We'd rather be in prison,” said Calogero Sinatra. “At least there we'd have company.”

In 1969 the com pany had earnings of $2,531,000, or 24 cents a common share, on sales of $2,508,755,000. In announcing the 1970 re sults, Davis S. Lewis, the com pany's chairman, said the figures reflected actions taken in setting up reserves and writ ing off losses after an assess ment by the company of all its contracts and their potentials. General Dynamics produces ships, aircrafts, building mate rials and electric equipment, among other lines. “We recognized,” Mr. Lewis said, “a number of uncertain ties in the Government's re quirements for defense and space systems in the future, and this led us to review all of our Government‐oriented busi ness and to make stringent as sumptions concerning our work on uncompleted contracts and the possibility, of additional orders on each of these pro grams.” In assessing performance of major company divisions in 1970, M Lewis Cited increased earnings from space programs and reduced earnings from the F‐111 military aircraft pro gram. Mr. Lewis said that work on the fuselage of the DC‐10 jet liner was progressing on schedule.

1006-> fetters to the Editor
To the Editor: Faster inflation is on the way. The mistakes of 1967 and 1968 that pro duced rising rates of inflation in 1969 and 1970 are being repeated. If current policies continue the result in 1972 will be much the same as in 1969—a rising rate of inflation. The current slower inflation — al though high by historic standards— will soon seem no more than a brief, temporary dip between two periods of inflation at a 5 per cent to 6 per cent rate. Is the current inflationary policy an attempt by the Nixon Administration to win re‐election next year? I don't think so. The principal result will be to leave us at the same place we would have been if we had not had the recession of 1970. Most of the high cost of slow ing inflation has been paid; the gains are now being squandered. Besides, the current, mistaken pol icies are produced by the independent Federal Reserve Board. The “Fed” is now printing money at one of the most inflationary rates ever maintained in peace time. Higher interest rates in 1971 and higher rates of inflation and interest rates in 1972 will be the result of the excessive monetary growth in 1971. The Federal Reserve is the creature of Congress. In the past, Senator Wil liam Proxmire and others have urged the “Fed” to adopt policies for stability and growth rather than policies like the current one, which produce in stability and inflation. They have favored a maximum growth rate of money no higher than 6 per cent. The current rate is highly erratic and there fore hard to measure, but has remained at twice the suggested rate for several months. The “Fed” seems to have lost any good judgment it may have had. Con gress should act now to stop the acceleration of inflation before it gets under way again. Limits should be placed on the growth rate of money. The Nixon Administration should do whatever it can to get the Federal Reserve to pursue rational policies that produce a return to stable growth, not renewed inflation. Now, not next year, is the time to prevent a resurgence of inflation and anticipations of inflation. Pittsburgh, May 14, 1971

1013-> New York at Miami
MIAMI, Oct. 2—After having lost their first two games, the Jets will be confronted with a crisis tomorrow against the Miami Dolphins. If the Jets lose again, they will have dropped 2½ games behind the Dolphins, the leader in the Eastern Division of the American Conference. But a victory would move the Jets to within half a game of the Dolphins, who registered a triumph and a tie in their first two games. The Jets' relation to the Dolphins is vital. With what appears to be a relatively easier schedule, the Dolphins loom a prime contender along with the Baltimore Colts for the divisional title. The Colts have a 1‐1 won‐lost record entering their game at New England tomorrow. The Jets are a 7‐point betting Underdog in the game that will te available on Channel 4 in the New York area tomorrow, beginning at 1 P.M. The Jets' success or failure presumably will depend on how their defensive unit handles the Dolphins' diversified offense with two big running backs, Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick, as well as a gifted quarterback, Bob Griese, and a sleek wide receiver often saved for the big play, Paul Warfield. “They'll try to run it down our throats with Kiick and Csonka, if they can,” said Walt Michaels, the Jets' defensive coach. “And they're two good backs.” In two games, Csonka has gained 161 yards in 33 carries, a 5‐yard average. Kiick, has gained 171 in 36 carries, a 4.5‐yard average. Against the Buffalo Bills last Sunday, each galloped for more than 100 yards, Kiick for 108 and Czonka for 103. Although the Bills' defense is weak, the Jets' defensive, unit was punctured for 198 yards by a running back two weeks ago, Norm Bulaich of the Colts. Even if the Jets control Csonka and Kiick, they then must stop Griese's posses to Warfield, which they were unable to do in the clutch when the Dolphins defeated the Jets with Joe Namath, 20‐6, at Shea Stadium a year ago. Warfield caught a 9‐yard touchdown pass against Earlie Thomas, the Jets' right cornerback. But in that game, Warfield's two most important receptions occurred when he lined up in a slot‐right formation, inside the Dolphins' wide receiver on the right side. When the Jet secondary shifted to cover him, Warfield outran double coverage by the Jets safeties, W. K. Hicks and Gus Hollomon. “If they put Warfield in a slot tomorrow,” Michaels said, “we'll keep Early Thomas on him.” Warfield caught five passes in that game for 122 yards. Howard Twilley, the Dolphins other wide receiver, caught six for 73 yards. But the Dolphins have inserted Otto Stowe, rookie, as the starter this season. He will be covered by Rich Sowells, the rookie who has replaced Steve Tannen, out with an ailing knee. Meanwhile, the Jets must generate an offense. In two games, they have produced only 10 points, low among National Football League teams. Al Woodall has completed 26 of 48 passes, but for a total of only 225 yards. Significantly, his leading receiver has been John Riggins, the rookie runner, with 12 catches for 72 yards.

1014-> Fischer Beats Petrosian to Gain Right to Play Spassky for Title
BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 26— Bobby Fischer of the United States defeated Tigran Petro sian of the Soviet Union for the fourth straight time tonight, winning their chess match and the right to play the world champion for the title. The victory gave Fischer 6½ points, the minimum needed in the 12‐game series. The re maining games scheduled for the Teatro San Martin here will not be played. Petrosian, a former world champion, will re ceive $4,500 and Fischer $7,500. With his victory over Petro sian, the 28‐year‐old Brooklyn high school dropout becomes the first American to reach the final step in the elimination series for the world champion ship. That final hùrdle is the world champion, Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union. The two will meet in a 24‐game title match next spring. The procedure for picking the site will probably be the same as that for the Fischer‐Petro sian match: the highest bidder among neutral countries will win, with the consent of the United, States Chess Federation and the Soviet Chess Federa tion. For 10 years, Fischer, a lanky bachelor with time for little else than chess, has considered himself the best player in the world. But until recently he had refused to prove it in the long and grinding rounds of elimination tournaments. During the elimination matches he maintained a win ning streak that reached 20 games and included two 6‐to‐0 victories over grandmasters—a record that had never before been recorded in modern high‐ level match and tournament play. The daring and flash of his game—he often goes all out to win with the black pieces, which usually are handled in a cautious and more defensive way gained him idolizing fans among the approximately 60 million chess players in the world. Even in the Soviet Union, where he once was re garded as overly brash, he has become a hero. The elimination series was established in 1948 to sort out a scramble for the title follow ing the death of the then world champion, Alexander Alekhine of the Soviet Union. The title competition was won by Mikhail Botvinnik of the Soviet Union and since that time the Soviet players who emerged as leading chess experts in the nineteen‐thirties because of powerful state aid, have held every title. The three‐year cycle of tourna ments is organized by the World Chess Federation. To challenge for the world championship, a player must survive in an international elimination contest that first produces zonal champions, then interzonal champions and finally a champion among the remaining aspirants. Many of the great names in American chess, such as Eman uel Lasker and Frank J. Mar shall, played before the compe tition was formalized. The most famous of all, Paul Morphy of New Orleans, who died in 1884, is generally conceded to have been the best of his time, but he was never able to get his British arch ‐ rival, Howard Staunton, to agree to a match. Fischer defeated the 42‐year‐ old Petrosian in a tail‐end win ning streak. He won the first, lost the second, drew the third, fourth and fifth, and then won four straight. Spassky won the world title in Moscow in 1969, at the age of 32, by beating Petrosian, 12½ to 10½. Petrosian had been champion for six years. The match touched off an epidemic of chess fever in Buenos Aires. In recent days it has been difficult to buy a chess set in the city's shops, despite the inflated price of $1.50 at the cheapest. Outside the vast hall of the San Martin Theater, on Avenida Corrientes, as many as 3,500 spectators began lining up at the box office at 9 A.M. for the 5 P.M. game. Fischer lounged in a swivel chair, occasionally leaning for ward as if he might lunge at the board after a move. Petro sian tucked his feet primly under his chrome and yellow‐ plastic chair and showed the tension only by suddenly grip ping his head in both hands. Occasionally, Fischer would clutch the side of his head or tap his foot. A glass of fresh orange juice was always at his side. During a game he would break for something to eat— his favorite snack being a grilled‐kidney sandwich. Petrosian would interrupt play to step behind a screen, for a sip of coffee from a vacuum flask prepared by his wife. A small, round woman, she watched her husband from the fourth row, which is actual ly the first because of Fischer's request, that the first three be kept empty. The ninth game was a classic example of obtaining a small advantage and building it up to a winning result. The opening was a French Defense, 1 … P‐K3, played by Petrosian in reply to Fischer's favorite open ing move, 1 P‐K4. Petrosian had tried the same defense in the third game. He varied on his fourth move by developing the queen knight, an unusual variation. It led to symmetrical game in the cen ter, but Fischer had the edge in development. In addition, Petrosian was saddled with doubled pawns. In view of the score, Petro sian might have been expected to adopt a more aggressive line, even with the black pieces. He seemed satisfied to equalize, and offered an exchange of queens. Fischer made the exchange, which, as it turned out, fur ther exposed the black pawns. Fischer immediately moved to open the queen bishop file, which his rook then com manded. A pawn exchange left Petro sian with a doubled pawn that would be difficult to hold. Giv ing up defensive tactics, Petro sian embarked on a seemingly desperate sally against the white king. Fischer's king marched to R4, some distance from the menacing black rooks. While Petrosian was preparing, Fischer picked up two more pawns. He seemed safe enough, especially with the queens off the board. With his back to the wall, Petrosian made his last game effort. Using his king and pawns, he set up a surprising mating threat that might have saved the game against a lesser opponent. Fischer was forced to give up his knight for two pawns, but he had been prepared for this. In the resulting position, all the pieces were off with the exception of Petrosian's knight. The mating danger was gone. Petrosian would have had to contend with five passed pawns, which could not be stopped. He might have ad journed the hopeless game, but decided to resign.

1015-> Porsche to Compete in Can‐Am Series
The Roger Penske‐Mark Donohue team will compete in the 1972 Canadian‐American Challenge Series in a new‐model Porsche, the Porsche‐Audi Division of Volkswagen of America announced yesterday. With Penske remaining as manager, Donohue will drive the 12‐cylinder Porsche 917‐10, a roadster, under a three‐year contract with the Porsche factory, which primarily involves the Sports Car Club of America's 10‐race J‐Wax/Can‐Am series for unlimited sports‐racing cars. Porsche, which recently won its third consecutive world manufacturers championship, had the door closed on that competition with the reduction in the engine size limit from five liters to three liters starting next year. Entry in the Can‐Am will be a first for Porsche. “There's a great deal at stake for us,” Donohue said yesterday, “and the pressure will be on Roger and me to produce a winner in the Can‐Am. But we fully expect to be competitive with the 917. Our reputation is on the line.” Compete with McLarens The Can‐Am series, which has the fastest cars in the world racing, “will be a challenge and an opportunity,” Penske said, adding, “We are looking forward to competing with the McLarens, which have dominated the Can‐Am.” For the 34‐year‐old Donohue, it will be a return to the CanAm competition after bypassing it for the last three years. When he first joined forces with Penske in 1966, they raced la Lola T70 Chevolet in the first Can‐Am series, winning one race and finishing second in the standing behind John Surtees for the highest‐placed United States team. In 1967 and 1968, Donohue overwhelmed a largely American‐driven Group 7 field to win the now defunct United States road racing championship. He continued to be the best American threat in the Can‐Am while finishing In third place both years. Technical details of the Penske/Porsche‐Audi 917 were not released, but it was reported the car will be a new version of the 12‐cylinder 917 and that a turbocharging test program was under way at the Porsche factory in Stuttgart, Germany. The 10‐race Canadian‐American Challenge Series begins in June at Mosport Park in Canada, and ends on Oct. 29 in Riverside, Calif.

1018-> Haber, Handball's Bad Boy, Off Form
The difference between last year's invitation fourwall handball tournament at the New York Athletic Club and this year's can be described in two words: Paul Haber. A year ago, in Haber's absence, Billy Yambrick of St. Paul won the glittering event from such top players as Steve August, Pat Kirby, Claude Benham and Stuffy Singer. This year, they're all back for the four‐day tourney, which ends today, except Yambrick, who is the best man at a wedding. But Haber's presence makes the atmosphere electric. “The guy is a character,” said Joseph P. Ingrassia, the chairman. “Haber drinks, eats and sleeps handball, and he's the greatest player in the world. But the trouble is, when he's not playing, he really drinks, smokes and runs around, plus a few other things.” The 34‐year‐old Haber, who has won the United States Handball Association title five of the last six years (he raised a year through injury), enjoys his bad‐boy reputation. “Hell,” announced Haber in a locker room full of eavesdropping players, “outside of winning handball titles, the only things I like to do are drink, smoke pot and chase broads. Why not? It's what most guys want to do, only they won't admit it.” What amazes Haber's fitness‐conscious rivals is his ability to play superbly even when hung over from a night of drinking. At first, they were annoyed, since Haber's antics were deemed bad for the sport's image. Now, it's just amazement. However fast Haber's lifestyle is off the court, it slows down when he plays an important match. “My best game is the soft game,” he agreed after beating Ed Woerner, the New Jersey champion, 21‐8, 21‐5, in first‐round match Friday. “Even though I can hit very hard with both hands when I want to, my strength is in my control. I can make the ball bounce off the ceiling to any spot on the back ?? wall, and this practically chains my opponent down. Then, when he's out of position, I put the ball away.” Haber's slowdown tactics can make it seem as if he's walking through a match while his opponent is scurrying around desperately digging the ball out of the back corners. Actually, Haber's 28 years of experience allow him to know where the ball will be. They also have allowed him to master the soft game, which few others have been able to do.. “Paul has a classic underhand swing and can hit the ceiling at just the right point time after time after time,” explained Woerner, a 36‐year‐old machine‐shop owner from Piscataway, N. J. “Since I swing sideways, it makes a ceiling shot a lot harder. However, he's got so much control and plays so often, I'd never have a chance with him.” Yesterday, however, Haber wasn't quite himself, for whatever reason, and Terry Muck of St. Paul eliminated him from the tournament, 21‐17, 21‐16. Haber was born in the Bronx and moved to Chicago when he was 10. He was taught four‐wall handball by his father, Samuel Haber, an eight‐time national champion. But before Paul became a winner at handball, he was a golf pro for 12 years. “The golf swing is the same as handball's,” Haber said, demonstrating it in front of a beer keg at the New York A.C. “But in golf, I was just an also‐ran, shooting 73, 74, you know, and where will that get you? “Now, my sole interest in handball is in winnina national championships. Nothing else matters. With the title of champ, I can make money writing books like my recent “Inside Handball” or sign a 10‐year contract with Memphis shoe company as just did or autograph a new handball glove.” If winning in handball was his only interest, someone asked, what would Haber do when he was over the hill? “What I'm doing now,” he answered. “Drink, smoke pot and chase broads.”

1019-> Notes on People
Cardinal Cooke, Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, left last night for his annual visit with American servicemen in Southeast Asia, and on the way will visit Israel and the Near East. The Cardinal Is due in Tel Aviv today and plans to visit Palestinian refugee camps near Amman, Jordan, tomorrow. On Christmas Eve lie will celebrate midnight mass in Bethlehem, and on Christmas day he will be in Jerusalem, where he will celebrate mass near the Holy Sepulcher. Before going to Thailand, South Vietnam and Okinawa in his capacity as the Vatican's military vicar in this country, the Cardinal will inspect Catholic Relief Service projects in Calcutta. He will return here Jan. 2. The Cardinal's departure had been delayed by the strike of teachers in the New York City Catholic schools. The White House will lie jammed with relatives of the First Family over the Christmas weekend. President and Mrs. Nixon expect to entertain their daughters and sons‐in‐law, the David Eisenbowers and the Edward Finch Coxes; both sets of in‐laws of the Nixon daughters, the John Eisenhowers and the Howard Coxes; and Mrs. Mamie Eisenhower, David Eisenhower's grandmother. Helen Hayes and her actor son. James MacArthur, helped dedicate a small Japanesestyle garden that she donated to Nyack Hospital in memory of Mary MacArthur, who died of polio in 1949 at the age of 19. The mother and brother of Miss MacArthur unveiled a plaque naming “Mary's Garden,” with the help of Mrs. MacArthur, who came here Sunday from Hawai with her husband. The family reunion was marred when Miss Hayes discovered that her Nyack home had been burglarized of $20,000 in jewelry. Miss Hayes was particularly distressed to learn the burglars had taken several items of sentimental value, including a cluster of emeralds her late husband, the playwright Charles MacArthur, had given her with the comment, “I wish they were peanuts.” Years earlier, when he was courting her, he peanuts and said, “I wish they were emeralds.” In Toulouse, France, it was reported that Jacques Maritain, the French Catholic philosopher, has become a monk. The 89‐year‐old Maritain, who once served as French Ambassador to the Vatican, was said to have joined the order of the Convent of the Little Brothers of Jesus at Rangueil, where he has lived in seclusion for a decade. A nominal Protestant, he married a Jew while both were students at the Sorbonne. Both later converted to Catholicism. No sooner was Tom Hayden, a prominent radical and opponent of the Vietnam war, off a plane in Shannon, than offiicals moved in and told him he wasn't welcome, The Irish Department of Justice refused to give any reason for making him persona non grata, and he was put aboard a plane bound for the United States. A friend said Mr. Hayden had hoped to visit relatives in Ireland. A leftist actor, Gian Maria Volonte, was one of 20 persons seized and shoved into paddy wagons after the police used tear gas to break up a striking workers protest in the Spanish Square in Rome. Mr. Volonte, who starred in the Oscar‐winning film ‘"Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion,” was filming the melee when he was arrested, and as he was taken away, he gave the clenched fist salute. The uproar, at the height of the Christmas shopping season, turned Rome's already hopelessly traffic‐jammed downtown area into hornblowing chaos. “With nine grandchildren thought it was about time I did something for Santa Claus,” said Robert A. Podesta, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development, and he did just that. Mr. Podesta announced that the town of Santa Claus, Ind., would receive a $160,800 grant to help create immediate jobs for the unemployed there. The grant, part of a $50‐million public works program, will be applied to construction of a new town ball, David Packard, former Deputy Secretary of Defense, was named winner of the annual James Forrestal Memorial Award, for leadership in promoting significant understanding and cooperation between industry and government in the interest of national security. The award is named for the first Secretary of Defense. The internationally ,known Japanese movie director Akira Kurosawa was in serious condition in a Tokyo hospital, following what the police said was a suicide attempt. Mr. Kurosawa's career has been in decline in recent years, and his company has been having financial troubles. With the last of the parole red tape cleared away, at Arizona State Prison, in Florence, the large, iron gates swung open to allow Winnie Ruth Judd, the convicted trunk murderer of the nineteen‐thirties, to walk away a free woman. Under terms of the parole, Mrs. Judd, now 67 years old, was whisked off to California, where she'll work for a family that emplcyed her some years ago after her seventh escape from prison. She is forbidden to relate or promote publication of her story, which involves the killing and dismemberment of two women and the shipping of their butchered parts from Arizona to Cal ALBIN KREBS.

1023-> Arabs Plan to Widen Petroleum Role
The Arab nations intend to move from being just producers of oil to participation in the entire spectrum of the world petroleum industry, A. M. Su hail Sadawi, Secretary General of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, said yesterday. Speaking here to the annual meeting of the American Arab Association for Commerce and Industry, Inc., the young Lib yan commented, “We realize that oil is a wasting asset and we have made plans to diversi fy for the future of our coun tries.” The first step will be the formation of an Arab tanker company to be jointly owned by the eight member states of the organization: Saudi Arabia, Libya, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Al geria, Bahrain, Dubai and Qatar. Mr. Sadawi said the tanker company would begin opera tions sometime after June. The move would be a major step since the producing na tions have traditionally not competed in the downstream end of the business with the companies. The Arab states will also en ter into a combined petroleum service company to engage in joint ventures with any foreign companies or consuming coun tries for oil exploration, pro duction, refining and market ing. A dry‐dock facility in the Persian Gulf will also be built, Mr. Sadawi said. These projects will be suported by the forma tion of a finance corporation which will work with foreign as well as Arab capital.

1024-> 20 JEWISH CENTERS FACE STRIKE THREAT
Employes at 20 Jewish community centers in the city and Westchester County threatened to strike next week if they were not able to obtain a “fair ettlement” in their bid for improved pay and benefits. A contingent of the 400 professional, clerical and maintenance employes at the 20 centers demonstrated yesterday in front of the headquarters of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, 130 East 59th Street, which helps to fund the centers. Local 1707, Community, and Social Agency Employes, which represents the community center employes, does not bargain with the federation however, but with a negotiating committee representing the 20 centers. The union said that it was not seeking across‐the‐board wage increases, but did went longevity increases and scale adjustments for professionals, plus various benefit improvements. The present minimum for clerical and maintenande employes is $100 a week, a spokesman said, but pay may run considerably higher, depending on the job and length of service. Salaries of profeesionals, he said, range froth about $8,040 to $13,580.

1026-> Watchmaker and Jeweler Are Shot to Death in Midtown Office
A watchmaker and a jeweler were found shot dead early yes terday in the watchmaker's fourth‐floor office in Manhat tan's diamond district. As of late yesterday the pb lice had not established a mo tive, although they suspected an attempted robbery. The victims, both men, were found at 2 A.M. by the watch maker's wife and daughter and a brother, who became con cerned when the watchmaker failed to arrive home from work Tuesday night. The victims were identified as Bezalel Bistricer, 49 years old, the owner of the B and B Watch Company at 49 West 47th Street, where the slayings took Place, and Sol Horn, 69, owner of Rembrandt Charms, Inc., a jewelry concern at West 47th Street, They were found lying on the floor of the small wood paneled office. An outer door to the hall and an inner office door that is unlocked by buzzer in the watchmaker's of fice were both ajar. The watchmaker, who cus tomarily worked alone, accord ing to the police, was shot in the head. The jeweler, de scribed by the police as an old friend of the watchmaker who apparently had stopped by late Tuesday, was shot in the head and chest. No weapon was found. The police said they had not yet inventoried the office to determine if anything had been taken. Display cases of watch es and watch bands showed no signs of having been dis turbed. The doors did not ap pear to have been forced. Police Inspector William Averill, in charge of a 15‐man investigative detail, said late yesterday he had not received a report on whether the men's wallets were stolen. He said that “a few dollars and change” was found on the office floor. The police said that a ‘medi cal examiner estimated the time of the shooting at about 10 P.M. Tuesday. Two tenants of the 13‐story building, which contains both offices and apart ments, told the police that they thought they had heard shots during the evening and had summoned a doorman, who found nothing. Mr. Bistricer, the watchmalt er, who lived at 1614 44th Street, Brooklyn, telephoned his wife, Sarah, about 7:30 P.M. Tuesday to say he would be home shortly, the polite said. That was the last she heard from him, theysaid. Mr. Horn, the jeweler, lived at 105‐13 63d Road, Forest Hills, Queens.

He was employed at the Jewel ry Dealers Exchange, Inc., 37 West 47th Street, just down the street of the store in which the bodies of the dead jeweler and watchmaker were found. He is survived by his widow, Mary, and three married daughters.

1027-> MISS MILYKO SINGS WITH STYLE IN DEBUT
Good looks, an attractive and poised stage personality and a knowledge of how to approach the music she sang were the positive qualities in Florences Milyko's debut in Carnegie Recital Hall on Tuesday night. Unfortunately, the New Yorkborn soprano has a light voice that is only intermittently satisfying, such as, when it is used softly or when it is pushed with a certain intensity. It is basically a colorless instrument, one that is not always produced freely, and it militated against her effectiveness. This was a pity, for Miss Milyko approached some Handel arias, lieder by Brahms and Wolf and Debussy's “Proses Lyriques” with a sensitivity for style. She brought off well Gordon Jacob's Three Songs for Soprano and Clarinet, in which the wind instrument set off the voice neatly. The first two of Rodrigo's Four Madrigals of Love had a winning simplicity to match their folk style, and the emotion Miss Milyko projected in two arias from Floyd's ‘Susannah’ made one almost forget the vocal limitations. Gibner King was the musicianly pianist and Ruth Feingold the expert clarinetist in the Jacob pieces.

1028-> LAKERS SET BACK CELTICS BY 124‐111
BOSTON, Dec. 1 (UPI)—Jerry West and Gail Goodrich combined for 78 points to lead the Los Angeles Lakers past the Boston Celtics, 124111, tonight in the National Basketball Association. It was the Lakers’ 15th conserative victory. West scored 45 points, with a 73 per cent shooting average, and Goodrich added 33 points, with 51 per cent accuracy. Wilt Chamberlain ruled the boards on offense and defense with 20 rebounds as the Boston defense fell apart. John Havlicek was high scorer for the Celtics with 36 points and Jo Jo White added 23. The Celtics fell eight points behind midway in the first period and never drew within that spread the rest of the eight. Hank Finkel came into the game in the second period, scored 13 points, and played the only creditable defense for the Celtics.

1030-> Spanish Prince Begins U.S. Visit Today
MADRID, Jan. 24 — Prince Juan Carlos de Borbon, Gener alissimo Francisco Franco's des ignated successor, begins a five day visit to the United States tomorrow with two difficult missions. The first is to win some fa vorable notice for the Spanish Government, whose interna tional standing has suffered from the repercussions of last month's court‐martial of 15 Basque activists. The second is to suggest to a foreign audience that in due course Spain will be characterized, not by the image of General Franco, but by that of somebody younger and more open‐minded. The 33‐year‐old prince, a tall, curly‐haired man who speaks English well, has a personal charm that most of his country men — from whom he is iso lated by the constraints placed on him by the regime are un aware of. During the two days in Wash ington that make up the official part of his visit, the Prince will talk with President Nixon, Sec retary of State William P. Rog ers, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and—according to present plans meet the press. The Spanish Embassy will give a dinner for the prince and his wife, Princess Sofia of Greece. Perhaps the visit's greatest challenge will be a breakfast scheduled with American news men in Washington. It is the first time that Prince Juan Car los has faced anything of the, kind. Foreign Minister Gregorio Lopez Bravo will accompany the Prince and attend his of ficial meetings. Another mem ber of the party is Gen. Carlos Dolz, head of Spain's military intelligence. The choice of Gen eral Dolz by the Prince, who has been cultivating his rela tions with the army, has aroused curiosity here. But officials say the General was chosen because he speaks English and has friends at the Pentagon. After Washington, the Prince will visit San Diego and Hous ton and will attend the Apollo 14 launching at Cape Kennedy. A visit to New York had been considered, but the State De partment ruled it out for se curity reasons. General Franco, who super vised the Prince's education, bypassed Don Juan, the Prince's father, who was the normal successor to the throne. For a number of years, Don Juan had been calling for a liberal monarchical alternative to Franco, and thus eliminated himself from the aging ruler's consideration. The Prince tells visitors that he believes in roughly the same ideas that his father holds. Spain, he has said privately, must evolve into some form of political democracy. He has told visitors that only if he convinces Spaniards that he represents more than a simple successor to General Franco does he have a chance of surviving after the General goes. But the Government's in sistence on a public display of orthodoxy has prevented him from getting the message across. Many Spaniards, inside the regime and out, still regard him as a simple young man, with little character and no ideas of his own. This impres sion was, if anything, strength ened, they say by the Prince's silence and inactivity during the crisis caused by the Burgos trial last month. The Prince's answer is that he has no power to intervene. According to those close to him, the Prince sees the Ameri can trip as a chance to convey, at least to the outside world, those cautiously evolutionary ideas that he has still not been able to voice publicly in Spain. On one occasion, a year ago, when some of these ideas were attributed to him in an article in The New York Times, the re action among some high Span ish officials was so violent that the Prince virtually disappeared from sight for months. Juan Carlos is expected to be able to speak with some free dom in Washington. But at the news conference, according to reliable sources here, an at tempt will be made to rule out sensitive questions in advance.

1032-> DAIREN
DAIREN, China, Aug. 14—The first thing you learn when you come to Manchuria is not to call It that. This rich industrial area, long the prize of war and struggle by Japan and Russia, is simply “Northeast China” to the Chinese, who now possess it in reason able security and are developing it as fast as they can. Dairen, the second port in China after Shanghai, is a fairly good symbol of how isolated China has been from the rest of the world and also of how this isolation is now coining to an end. Even in a metropolitan community od four million, it is news that an Ameri can correspondent has been allowed to come here for the first time in almost a generation. Crowds gather in the streets just to observe this extraordinary phenome non, and small children run Indoors or seek the protection of their parents whenever the strange apparition ap pears. Yet Northeast China is obvi ously coming back into the world. Along Dairen's modern waterfront these last few days were ships from Britain, Germany, Japan, the Soviet Union, Norway and Somalia. One dock was crowded with Chinese trucks being hoisted aboard a modem Chi nese freighter for Dar es Salaam, and according to officials here, the com mercial traffic is heavier than at any lime since the Communists took over this country in 1949. Dairen has a handsome setting at the southern tip of the Liaotung Pen insula, which juts out into the Yellow. Sea. It has a vast, well‐protected, crescent‐shaped harbor, fairly secure from typhoons, and has a backdrop of hills and an atmosphere quite different from most Chinese cities. The evidence of Japanese occupa tion is still very apparent. The build ings are taller, more functional and less Chinese somehow than in other major Chinese communities. There is even a Victorian church on “Friend ship Square” in the middle of the city, its green gate locked, its modest tower covered with a vast colored poster of Mao Tse‐tung, and its churchyard almost invisible behind a large propaganda billboard, Still, Dairen is obviously jumping with the Communist Government's drive for industrialization. It cannot compare with Shenyang, formerly Mukden, as a center of heavy industry or with Anshan, 75 miles north, which has the largest iron and steel complex in China; but it has a sizable electrical and locomotive industry, and if smoke is any indication of progress, it is on its way to acquiring all the advan tages and disadvantages of the mod em industrial world. Officials here are naturally a little skeptical about Western reporters. In most places the Chinese people tend to vanish when you aim a camera at them, but on the whole officials have been generous about allowing the use of cameras and tape recorders, and even expediting film out of the country without questions. But here in Dairen the regulations were a little more strict. Cameras in side or on narrowly confined subjects outside but no general views of the harbor or the city in general. This was no great handicap, since the factories were obviously more interested in the smoky atmosphere of production than anything else. According to officials here, the Dairen harbor employed over 40,000 men during the Japanese occupation, but is now handling three times as much commercial traffic with a little over 10,000. In 1970, officials say, Dairen harbor handled 50 per cent more goods than in the peak period before the Chinese Cultural Revolution of 1966–69, and was 24 per cent above its official target for the first six months of 1971. There is, of course, no way to make an objective check on these figures, but it is possible to confirm the offi cial claim that the docks have been rebuilt and that modern freight han dling equipment has been installed in the last few years. Two things mark the official con versation in Northeast China: an obvi ous determination to increase produc tion and improve the standard of life of the workers, and an intense anti Japanese feeling that is even more noticeable here than in Peking or in the South. Japan, of course, controlled, North east China for forty years, more than half of this century so far, and many of the people a visitor is invited to meet have vivid and persuasive horror stories to tell about the suffering of the workers under the Japanese. The main thing, however, is the obvious energy and activity of the people. One had been prepared for this in the agricultural South, and in the larger farms north of the Yangtze, but the Chinese workers are handling mod ern automated equipment in the vast steel rolling mills at Anshan with the same enthusiasm and political zeal as the peasants in the agricultural com munes farther south. At Anshan, to keep the electrical supply going even during storms, they have developed a system of repairing high‐tension wires without cutting off the power, even of using dynamite to fuse broken wires while workmen are actually handling circuits carrying up to 220,000 volts. At least they put on a demonstration of the system, and for a man who is vaguely scared about changing a fuse, it was an impressive performance. So things are happening in what used to be called Manchuria, and if production is rising with the spirit of the officials, Northeast China will have a lot more to show to visitors in the coming years.

1034-> FOREIGN AFFAIRS
ATHENS—The merican dilemma in Greece is in a sense whether to be liked by the Government and disliked by the people in order to shore up sagging Mediterranean strategic posi tion, or whether to jeopardize U.S. ability to stand by NATO and Middle East commitments in order to affirm preference for democratic rule. James G. Lowenstein and Richard M. Moose, special investigators for the Senate Committee on Foreign Rela tions, aptly stated this by writing: “U.S. policy has had two declared ob jectives: to maintain Greek military cooperation with the United States and NATO, and to bring about the restoration of democratic institutions in Greece. Both objectives became en meshed in the matter of the embargo on heavy arms.” This has developed into a boiling Issue here since the House of Rep resentatives voted in Washington to suspend such help unless the Presi dent invokes a special “national se curity” escape clause. And, mixed with the matter of the American legislative restriction is that of American popularity. The United States is getting the worst of both worlds. The Govern ment is furious that any restrictions should be placed upon pledged aid to a loyal NATO ally that maintains the longest military service period and is perhaps in the most exposed position. At the same time the opposition com plains that Washington supports the “colonels’ “. regime and introduced it in the first place. Part of this complaint arises from the fact that prior to the Lowenstein Moose visit the American Embassy apparently minimized contacts with political leaders of the previous re gime, virtually all of whom are in opposition, and seemed to seek un necessarily cozy relations with the colonels. Moreover, too many U.S. officials, including military and naval commanders, permitted themselves to be photographed in posed pictures here. All this encouxaged orgaigzed prop aganda on the extreme left to fan flames against the U.S.A. The Greeks have an unfortunate habit of blaming others for their own mistakes, per haps because they refuse to tarnish their excessive pride known as philotimo. With an ambassador who, on State Department instructions, avoided call ing on exiled King Constantine for eighteen months after coming here, although accredited to the sovereign, and with continual displays of grouped American and Greek officials, an im pression was inculcated that this re gime was of our making and we liked it. Furthermore, the local press has recently been publishing anti‐regime testimony culled from the U.S. Con gressional Record and emphasizing criticism of the American Embassy. A compendium of opposition opin ions, largely anti‐U.S., has been printed in London representing the views of exiled leaders. This claims (to cite Markos Dragoumis, a former deputy) that 9f U.S. support were withdrawn for Just 24 hours the Junta would collapse.” It also says (quoting John Katris, a Journalist) the 1967 coup was “positively supported by NATO and agencies of the American Government,” Similar opinions are widely held in Greece itself. But the evidence is wholly unconvincing. The United States for long withhold vurious kinds of milli tary aid and even when former Pre mier Karamanlis, the most prominent political emigr4, called for a Greek Army revolt—nothing happened. As for U.S. connivance in the coup, nei ther the Embassy nor the C.I.A. knew of it in advance and, in fact, ex pected an entirely different group— royalist generals—to attempt a similar exercise. At this Instant the United States is unpopular with both the regime and the masses for contrasting reasons. But there is no need to react to this situation with emotional extremism. It is a Greek, not an American, habit to touch the stars with one hand and the mud with the other. The United States neither produced the coup nor keeps these coup‐makers in power. One has but to recall that only one man was killed when occurred (and that was accidental) and when King Constantine summoned a counter‐coup with his generals not a single Greek fought for the colonels’ overthrow. There is only one sensible policy for Washington to follow now. It should continue in every possible way to press the Athens Government to re store freedom and it should maintain full contacts with the opposition while enjoining U.S. officials from foolish endorsement‐of—arrideology we don't admire. But, at the same time, it should recognize that Greece as a NATO ally is entitled to modern armament. We don't have to love this regime any more than we have loved past Portu guese or Turkish regimes while ful filling our NATO obligations. And we require Greek air and naval bases to implement U.S. commitments in an area otherwise largely hostile.

1035-> Chemical Bank Loses Suit Involving Master Charge
More than 130,000 holders of Master Charge credit cards may be entitled to a gift of $100 from Chemical Bank as the re sult of a decision handed down last week in Federal Court here. Judge Marvin E. Frankel ruled that the bank had violated the 1968 Truth in Lending law be cause it failed to disclose its annual finance charge on monthly statements sent to Master Charge cardholders from July to December 1969. The law provides for dam ages of not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 a person for such a violation. A spokesman for Chemical Bank said no decision had been made yet about appealing Judge Frankel's ruling. The law which went into effect in July, 1969 specifies that statements by lenders show both the monthly finance charge and the over‐all yearly rate, which in the case of Chemical Bank Master Charge is 18 per cent on bills not paid within 25 days. The suit against Chemidal Bank was brought in Septem ber 1969, by Michael Ratner, now a 28‐year‐old law clerk for another Federal judge, Constance Baker Motley. Mr. Ratner said yesterday that he had noticed the ab sence of the annual finance charge almost immediately on his bills after he had become a Master Charge customer. “I couldn't believe it—it seemed so blatant,” he said. He took the case up with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, an organiza tion that has brought many con sumer lawsuits in the past. They filed a class action suit on behalf of 132,233 other card holders who, the bank testified, had also received during the period statements lacking, the yearly finance charge. Although Judge Frankel de nied all of the bank's argu ments asking for dismissal of the case and found Chemical guilty, two major questions must still be reselved. One is whether a class ac tion” is appropriate in this case —that is whether all ‘the card holders involved benefit from the decision or just Mr. Ratner. The other question is what damages are to be imposed on the bank. If the class action is sus tained and the minimum fine, $100 id each case, is imposed, Chemical might have to pay more than $13 million. The bank had argued, that many other banks issuing cred it cards had also failed to men tion the annual finance charge on statements. Banking experts said yesterday that if the rid ing were upheld, Mr. Ratner's suit could prove enormously costly to the industry. In its defense, Chemical said it did not put the annual nance charge or some bills be cause its attorneys had inter preted the then‐new law as not requiring it. The finance charge was listed only on those bills of customers who, by not paying within 25 days during the pre vious month, had incurred the finance charge. But Mr. Ratner's attorneys argued that people who did pay their bills promptly were never aware of what the pen alty might be for paying late. In his decision, Judge Frankel noted that the law's intent was to give consumers “pertinent information before the plunge” into credit‐card, buying so that they could shop around for the best credit terms. Chemical is one of numerous banks that offer Master Charge, the most widely held credit card in the country. Master Charge has 36 million customers nationwide and an annual dollar volume in sales and “cash advances” (loans) of $4.14‐billion. Chemical Bank re fused to disclose yesterday how many Master Charge cus tomers it has. Asked what he would do with the money if he is awarded damages by the court, Mr. Ratner replied with a chuckle, “I'd give it to Ralph Nader.”

1039-> Bishop Obtains Financing, Ending Chapter XI Phase
Bishop Industries, Inc., pro ducer of toiletries and beauty aids, announced yesterday the end of its proceedings under Chapter XI of the Federal Bank ruptcy Act. An arrangement, which provides for payment to the unsecured creditors of 20 per cent of their claims, was issued by Federal District Court in New Jersey. Corporation, which posted a 13 per cent earnings gain in the first quarter, may well be facing a “relatively flat earnings outlook,” Keefe thinks. Its planned acquisi tion of two banks in suburban Suffolk and Rockland Coun ties, with total assets of about $100‐million, could create di lution of 10 cents a share‐or more “if it goes through.” The First Chicago Corpora tion's management is con tinuing its “impressive” cost control program, Keefe says, but heavy reliance on Fed eral funds with overnight maturities on which rates have risen rapidly could narrow spreads. Look ‘for earnings of $6.45 to $6.58 a a share up from $6.01 a share in 1970. The First National City Corporation should earn $2.85 to $2.90 a share, up from $2.65 a share a year ago. The Manufacturers Han over Corporation stands to show an earnings dip to be tween $2.85 and $2.90 a share from $3.04 in 1970 unless the tempo of the economy picks up. J. P. Morgan Co., Inc., faces considerable uncer tainty. For the full year Keefe expects its earnings to be 5.75 to $5.85 a share, up from $5.57 a share in 1970. * How's that, again? Substi tute a punched card for the traditional stock certificate? Who on earth would suggest that? None other than you guessed it I.B.M. The huge computer company has asked the New York Stock Ex change to allow it to hand out punched cards to holders of its certificates to help al leviate the paperwork prob lem. It would seem to follow that if this were allowed there would be a clamor by others to Join the switch. But the Big Board is not ready to go along with the idea it would appear. One of ficial confirmed that the In ternational Business Machines Corporation had made the re quest but said that no answer had been given as yet. He noted that many Wall Street leaders still felt it might be better to eliminate certificates altogether. Meanwhile Arthur T. Roth took matters into his own hands. The chairman of the Bank of Suffolk County said the bank had used a punched card stock certificate to pay a 100 per cent stock dividend and that he hoped other corporations would follow this break with tradition. William C. Jaus, Bishop's president, said that the com pany has secured financing to implement the arrangement with creditors and for its oper ations following elimination of several unprofitable phases of the business. About 25 per cent of Bishop's outstanding shares has been owned by the Realty Equities Corporation. The new financing will increase Realty Equities holding to about 47 per cent of Bishop's common stock.

1040-> Peking Gains Favor With Chinese in U.S.
The Communist Government in Peking is gaining greater ac ceptance and qualified approv al from significant segments of the traditionally conservative and largely apolitical Chinese community in the United States. This change in attitude has been taking place over the last few years, spurred by Peking's stronger international position and its domestic achievements, which include the launching of an artificial earth satellite. The attitude reflects not an ideological commitment to Communism but rather a feeling of nationalism, and the belief that the Government in Peking is doing much to restore pride to a people too long humiliated and victimized by foreign powers. “When Communist China ex ploded an atomic bomb,” an immigrant from Taiwan said, “all Chinese, Communist and anti‐Communist, felt proud.” Last Oct. 1, for the first time in 21 years, celebrations were held in Chinatowns in New York and San Francisco to mark the anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China. In reporting the events, Hsinhua, the Chinese press agency, declared that “more than 400 patriotic overseas Chinese” had taken part in New York. “This is the first time patriotic over seas Chinese in New York openly celebrated the brilliant festival of the great mother land,” it said. Outspoken supporters of Pe king remain a tiny minority of the nearly 400,000 ethnic Chi nese in the United States, most of whom remain preoccupied with such mundane tasks as studying, working and bringing up children. At the same time, dedicated supporters of the Chinese Na tionalist Government in Taiwan are also a tiny, but important, minority. Its members are the leaders of Chinatowns and have traditionally spoken for the Chinese community. The majority, of Chinese can not be described as supporters of either Chinese Government. One long‐time resident of China town in New York observes: “Ninety‐five per cent or the community is anti‐Communist and 90 per cent is a??ation alist.” While his figure: may be subject to dispute, it is un doubtedly true that there are few ardent supporters of either the Nationalists or the Commu nists. But hope that the Na tionalists will one day ??rn to the mainland has faded and increasingly the reality or a Communist‐ruled China is being accepted. In spite of this, the China town leadership has remained firmly in the Nationalist camp. Indeed, many of the community leaders are members of the Kuomintang, or Nationalist party. The Nationalist Government takes an active interest in overseas Chinese affairs, It has often stated that, just as over seas Chinese were instrumental in helping Dr. Sun Yat‐sen overthrow the Manchu imperial Government in 1911, so they will play an important role in the recovery of mainland China. The Nationalists sponsor study programs in Taiwan for overseas Chinese and encour age Chinese scholars to give seminars in Taiwan during the summer, paying them travel allowances and often providing hotel accommodations. Overseas Chinese organiza tions, on their part, seek to strengthen the Nationalists' diplomatic position. Every year, while the United Nations de bates the China‐seating ques tion, overseas Chinese organiza tions, declaring that they rep resent the millions of Chinese around the world, take full‐page advertisements in The New York Times and the New York Daily News to voice their op position to seating Communist China in the United Nations. And every time a high Na tionalist official comes to New York, he is warmly received by Chinese community leaders. When Vice President C. K. Yen visited New York last fall; he was honored at a dinner at, which virtually all the leaders of the family‐name associa tions, area associations, tongs and trade groups were present. These groups, which form the conglomerate Chinese Consoli dated Benevolent Association, make up the Establishment of Chinatown. Benevolent associations have for generations been the spokesmen of the community. They have acted as arbitrators in disputes between members of the community and given help to needy immigrants. Nowadays, however, many, especially the young, regard the benevolent association and its leadership as out of step with realities, without the means or the ability to cope with new problems. The benevolent association “did a lot for the community in the old days,” Chester Lee, a 22‐year‐old Columbia student who lives in Chinatown, said. However he added: “Young peo ple consider it anachronistic. It can't deal with present‐day problems.” While disaffection with the benevolent association and its alleged inability to cope with community problems does not in itself indicate a rejection of the leaders political view points, the positions taken on. Communist China tend to divide on generational lines. The older generation, con sisting of men in their sixties, is stanchly anti‐Communist. For the most part, they are men of rural backgrounds who came to the United States 30 or 40 years ago with the intention of making enough money to re turn to China for their retire ment. Some had bought land in China for themselves and their families. After the Communist take over of mainland China in 1949, they were forced to remain in what they essentially feel is a foreign country. They saw their land confiscated and many of their relatives killed or im prisoned. Their opposition to Communism rests on personal experience, not on ideological grounds. The Communist victory in China resulted in a new wave of immigrants to the United States. For the most part, they were better educated city peo ple who settled outside of Chinatown. These people are often ambivalent in their polit ical views. They left China be cause they did not want to live under the Communists, but they are also disillusioned with the Nationalists, whom they blame for the loss of the mainland because of corruption and ineptness. New immigrants, who have been arriving since the immi gration regulations were re laxed in 1965, are mostly from Hong Kong. Those who take a political position are on the whole anti‐Communist. The American‐born Chinese as a rule do not feel a personal involvement in Chinese politics as do some of their parents. According to Mr. Lee, a second‐ generation American, “most Chinese‐Americans are prob ably against Mao but they realize he's doing something for the Chinese people.” The group that has been most affected in recent years are the students, who are, more politi cally conscious. They left the mainland with their parents when the Communists took over in 1949 and settled in either Taiwan or Hong Kong. Both Chiang Kai‐shek and Mao Tse‐tung are subjected to strong denunciation, when poli tics are discussed by intellectuals, but criticism of the Na tionalists is often more intense because the Nationalist Govern ment has a more immediate im pact on, their, lives. Others feel that, while Peking and Taiwan are bath undemocratic, Taiwan is the lesser of two evils. “Mao is uniting China, but he is ruling China through fear,” said Kan Bun‐yuen, a graduate student who went to college in Taiwan. Voicing a feeling shared by many stu dents, he added: “The Government in Peking brings them pride, but it they have to live ht either mainland China or Taiwan, they would live in Taiwan because it is more tolerant of personal think ing and a personal way of life.” Another student said: “If only the Chinese Comthunists would stop killing so many people, many of us will go back.” The acceptance of the reality of Communist China was also indicated in a recent poll taken by the Chinese Students Council, an intercollegiate body. In response to the question “Should Red China be admitted into the. U.N.?” 68.7 per cent of more than 100 students polled responded affirmatively. Dr. C. T. Wu of Hunter Col lege, who works closely with the student council, feels that the Chinese community Is al ready in the prom's of polari zation. “Polarization is not obvicius now but it is going on,” he said. “As soon as the United States recognizes Communist China, or if Communist. China is ad mitted to the United Nations the Chinese community will be sp??. Professor Wu said one reason the Chinese community is anti Communist is that the. Chinese. “want to show their loyalty to the United States in order to protect themselves.” Once American polled on China changes, he said, there will be a big split in the community. The radical group in China town that is causing some of the present polarization is I Wor Kaen, which sponsored the pro Peking celebrations on Oct. 1. Its appeal to the community is predominantly nationalistic, though it is openly Maoist. In a recent article in its bilingual newspaper, Getting Together, it said: “In old Kuomititang China, from which most of us came, we were enslaved and exploited. Our people were drugged with opium, our women raped, our men kidnapped. We were told Chinks and Dogs Keep Out! “In New China, there is no more domination or exploita tion. People are not subject to ridicule and intimidation. We arose and stood up, erect and proud, a free and strong na tion.” Though the number of those actively involved in I Wor Kuen is believed to be small, it has had an impact on Chinatown. The free movies of revolution ary China that it sponsors are well attended, even by mem bers of the older generation. There is a widespread belief that the Federal Bureau of In vestigation and other intelli gence agencies have the group's storefront office, at 24 Market Street, under surveillance. For this reason many who might otherwise be drawn there, if only through curiosity, avoid the office. Fear of political repression by the United States Govern ment is real. The internment of Japanese‐Americans during World War II is often cited as an example of what Chinese might expect if the United States should go to war with Communist China. Fear of deportation also pre vents many from openly taking a pro‐Communist, or at least an anti‐Nationalist, position. This fear is widespread among those who are here on temporary visas, such as students, and even among permanent resi dents who have not yet become American citizens. There ??so fear that evert political demonstrations not Communist‐inspired, such as the recent anti‐Japanese pro tests over the oil‐rich Senkaku Islands, would result in in creased surveillance. A statement by the F.B.I. di rector, J. Edgar Hoover, to a House subcommittee in 1969 is still fresh in many minds. Mr. Hoover said: “We are being confronted with a growing amount of work in being alert for Chinese Americans and others in this country who would assist Red China in supplying needed ma terial or promting Red Chinese propaganda. “For one thing, Red China has been flooding the country with its propaganda and there are over 300,000 Chinese in the United States, some of whom could be susceptible to recruit ment either through ethnic ties or hostage situations because of relatives in Communist China.” Although many Chinese feel a sense of pride in Communist achievements, they are at the same time repelled by what they see as oppression by the Peking Government. “If Red China stops its policy of internal persecution a lot of people will go back,” said Robin Wu, a librarian who came to this country as a teen ager in the nineteen‐fifties. “I don't see any hope for Taiwan.”

1041-> Notes From the Orient: A ‘Disneyland’ and Other Surprises
TOKYO—We flew from Los Angeles to Tokyo and were overwhelmed to see a man in the crowd at the Tokyo Airport holding a large sign reading, “Welcome, Mr. and Mrs. Smithers.” We knew no one in Japan. But we had made a hotel reservation, and this was the acknowledgement. It is unexpected things like this that acid delight to a trip, and to make sure that such memories were recorded ac curately while my husband and I were traveling in the Orient, I jotted down a number of items in a notebook. My notes touch on such things as the Japanese equivalent of Disneyland, the reason why no hospital room in Japan is ever marked Number 4, party games with geisha girls and the Nation alist Chinese penchant for American best sellers. The tidbits of information were scribbled down during travels in Japan, Taiwan, Jahore in Malaysia and Okinawa. • Dreamland amusement park is situ ated on a hillside in Nara. In most respects it is a replica of Disneyland in California, with five parts: Main Street, Fantasy Land, Adventure Land, Tomorrow Land and Ancestor Land. We were welcomed at the entrance by a guide, who called himself a public relations man and stayed with us throughout our tour. He plied us with questions about the United States, for he had lived in the Middle West and was eager for news of that area. He was delighted when I drew a No. fortune stick at a concession stand. He said it was about the luckiest fortune possible and was seldom drawn by any one. Since it was calligraphed in Japa nese, I would never have known of my rosy future without his interpre tation. The Japanese have a convenient method of ridding themselves of bad luck when they draw an unfavorable fortune. They simply tie the slip of paper onto a small tree, which becomes a fluttering white mass, and buy a new fortune. • We picked up an occasional guided tour and obtained a liberal education as we rode buses with fellow passen gers, tour guide and driver. Japanese roads are so narrow it is virtually a necessity to have two operators on each bus. A girl who stands on the left side of the driver is called “The Crick et,” a back‐seat driver moved to the front. She warns and guides and, when the bus is in close quarters or has to back up, she gets out and stands be hind the vehicle, giving signals with a shrill tin whistle. Hence, the term cricket. The tour guide, using his teaching syllabus, informed us that eating seaweed wards off gray hair, baldness and the shrinks (wrinkles). He was a college graduate with a keen sense of humor and had his tongue in his cheek when giving us this folklore. He also took pleasure in kidding American men about their independent minded wives. He said that when he returned from work his wife was al ways waiting. She greeted him with bow of obeisance, brought him sake, drew his bath and washed his back. The guide also explained that many Japanese women shave and that those wearing native kimonos powder their faces heavily because they think kimo nos are too colorful for their yellow skins. When we were scheduled to make rest‐room stop the guide would say, “We are stopping now. You will find the ‘so‐and‐so’ to the right in the hotel lobby.” I have heard a restroom called just about everything, but “so‐and‐so” was a new one for us. • At the Kamakura Temple stands a 44‐foot‐high hollow bronze statue of Buddha. He appears to have tight little curls all over his head. The guide told us these were not curls but snails. When Buddha was meditating he sat still so long the snails crawled up on him. “If they really are curls,” he added, “Buddha had the first permanent wave.” • Stopping in the orange and tea coun try, we were given a tour of a Christian girls' school. When we arrived, the girls had just entered the chapel for morn ing service. The striking part of the scene was the sea of black heads above white collars on navy blue dresses. Not a blonde, a redhead or a brownette among them, just black, black, black. No wonder, I (a blonde) was later swamped for my autograph. The guide gave us a language lesson as we resumed our ride. To the tune of “London Bridge Is Falling Down” we sang. Moshi, moshi, ano ne. (Hello I say) Ah sooo deska? (Is that so?) Ali gato mina sun. (Thank you everybody) Sayonara (But good‐by.) I found my high school and college Spanish a help, for Japanese vowels are pronounced like those in Spanish. For instance, “e” has an “a” sound and “i” sounds like “e.” A few words that the guide thought would he indispensable for us were “gusai” (my stupid wife), “eno” (picture), “shima” (island) and “kusai” (stinker). • The western conception of the geisha girl is what the Japanese call “pillow geisha,” but they resent the concept. They insist the better‐class geisha fol lows a highly respected profession. She is likened to an American movie star;. like many movie stars, she lives be yond her means. She must often pay $1,000 apiece for her costumes, and she must go to the beauty parlor every other day to keep her elaborate coif fure smooth. Geishas are supposedly very talented girls, educated to their profession by older geishas no longer able to enter tain. We attended one geisha party. There were 20 of us, all tourists, sitting on pillows around a room behind low tables. The pretty, young geishas made them selves available to everyone. A geisha would kneel opposite a guest and serve his or her food, speaking only when spoken to. (It was strange to eat in front of someone who just watched you and saw that your wine cup was never empty.) After dinner came games, dancing and singing. A younger geisha danced to the accompaniment of another geisha who was at least 70 years old. The dance was slow and amounted to pos turing. The games were baseball and paper scissors‐rock, For baseball, the geisha would choose a man from the audience and the two would pantomime a pitcher batter situation. For paper‐scissors rock, a man or woman would be chosen and the finger‐snipping, fist‐pounding, etcetera, would be done to the cheers of the audience. While it made an entertaining evening, it was hard to see where great talent was required on the part of the geisha. • On a visit to Pearl Island we learned that only 50 per cent of the pearls grown are good enough to sell; the other 50 per cent are ground up to be used as calcium for pregnant women. We also learned that too large a pearl can kill an oyster. • Among other bits of information we picked up were the fact that the Japa nese plant trees on their beaches to keep the sand from blowing away and that one of the words for the number four in Japanese also means “to die”; consequently, there are no rooms num bered four in their hospitals. • The Ise Shrine is the headquarters for all Shinto shrines in Japan. It is con sidered a must for Japanese to visit Ise once in a lifetime. The original shrine, it is claimed, was built in 92 B.C., but every 20 years the shrine is torn down and rebuilt. People come from all over the world to get pieces of the sacred building and carry them away in white paper for good luck and safety. In Japan the ritual is likened to Christians' obtaining a St. Christopher medal. At every shrine in Japan one en counters hundreds of school children. They are taken on excursions to these holy places as a part of their educa tion. Our guide said Eastern children are no different from Western. “The girls giggle all night,” he explained, “and the boys pillow fight. The next day they sleep through the lecture.” • The sacred deer of Nara are famous. They roam the temple grounds and beg tourists for a special cookie that is sold at concession stands, You jolly well better buy and feed, for if you hold up your hands proving them empty, the deer will butt you. There is a story that goes around about the early ruler of the area who regarded the deer so highly he issued orders that anyone who harmed one would be put to death. People got up early each morning to see if there was a dead deer on their lawn. If there was, they hurriedly transferred it to the lawn of a neighbor. Hence, the origin of the expression “passing the buck.” Or so the guide said. • We stopped in Taiwan for a few days. I purchased a book at the President Hotel there and thought it would be nice to have it autographed by a Na tionalist Chinese. At the airport I asked one in uniform to do so. He looked at me as if in shock. “Did you buy this here?” he said. I answered I nad. “Cover it up,” he said. “Don't let the Customs officer see it. If he does, tell him you bought it in Okinawa.” I couldn't understand his concern. The book was an American novel recently released in the United States. What was the danger? I went through Customs and luckily (for I didn't want to lie about it) the book was over looked. It was some time before I found out why the Chinese officer was so con cerned. It seems the Nationalists get best sellers from the United States, print copies in their own shops and, by so doing, pay no royalties to either pub lisher or writer. Across the straits from Singapore lies Jahore, which has a beautiful Moslem mosque. The floor is Italian marble covered with carpeting from England. The crystal chandeliers were imported from Czechoslovakia. But the strange and inconsistent part is that although no native woman is allowed in the mosque, even to worship, I, a Christian female, was guided through the building by a Moslem, who had even been to Mecca. He willingly autographed a map I was carrying and I, in turn, was asked to sign his guest register. Women are considered bad luck in Jahore, so they can't go near a man when he is fishing. The only place they seem to be of value is at the border between Singapore and Jahore. Singa pore, being a free port and Jahore not, much smuggling takes place, and the border guards are both male and female. The female officers search women and are not only excellent shots but judo artists as well. • The primary purpose of our trip to the Orient was to see our Marine son, stationed on Okinawa. There is a dis trict there called B.C., which has one main street about six blocks long —a solid stretch of pawn shops and clubs. Anything can be sold or purchased and everything is. The area doesn't really awaken until afternoon. Then the dickering begins. The newest guitar pawned for enough to buy a few rounds of drinks. A wedding band is abandoned with the arrival of a curt letter from home, and the local tailor is deluged with orders for colorful patches to be sewn on jackets. • A final note about food in the Orient. We were delighted to find scrambled eggs and toast on the menu in our hotel restaurant in Tokyo. The food on the plane had been abundant and exotic, but it is hard to quickly develop a taste for raw tuna, cold rice wrapped in sea weed and cheese on a banana leaf even when daintily arranged and pleasingly served.

1042-> 2 Historic Churches in ‘Village’ Seeking to Merge
Two of New York's historic Episcopal churches, two blocks apart in Greenwich Village and both experiencing declining at tendance, are planning to merge. The churches, Ascension at Fifth Avenue and 10th Street and Grace, at Broadway and 10th, have both been designat ed as landmark buildings. They are looking for a rector “ma ture” enough to serve both congregations and to guide the two parishes to union. Officials of both churches, each of which has a congrega tion of about 600 people, em phasized yesterday that plans were still in an exploratory stage with many problems ahead, not the least of which will be the future of the two edifices as separate houses of worship. The church leaders, however, agreed that the merger of two Episcopal churches only two blocks apart was a feasible idea. The Rev. Dr. John M. Krumm, for the last six years rector of the Church of the Ascension, will leave next month to be consecrated as Bishop of the Diocese of Southern Ohio. The Rev. Dr. Benjamin Mini fie, 60‐year‐old rector of Grace Church since 1960, said that he was in “no hurry” to retire but that he was “100 per cent” in favor of the projected, merger. Dr: Nicholas P. Christy, warden at the Church of the Ascension, Said yesterday after the 11 A.M. service that “con solidation makes sense and could even be exciting.” His fellow warden, E.A.G. Manton, agreed. And in a tele phone interview, Whitney North Seymour Sr., warden at Grace Church, expressed pleasure at the turn of., events but empha sized the exploratory stage of the negotiations. Two churchgoers at Ascen sion commented but asked to remain anonymous. One said the “whole idea is impractical right from the start.” The other likened his favorite church to his favorite pub. “They are both warm, friendly and comfort able,” he said, “I wouldn't like to switch.” Wilber Loomis of Queens, who commutes to Ascension every Sunday, said the music at it was “great,” and he hoped a merger would not change that. The plans of the two churches became known when a “letter from the wardens” was published in Ascension's current monthly bulletin. The letter said, in part: “We had to recognize that consid erable change has taken place in the area served by the two churches, with the result that attendance at both has de dined. “It seemed only sensible to find out whether any arrange ments between the two par ishes were feasible, and wheth er they would result in stronger parishes than would be the case if they, remain entirely separate.” Joint committees were es tablished to discuss all phases of the merger, and the two vestries have agreed to work together in the search for a new rector at Ascension. According to “Dr. Krumm, attendance at Ascension de creased 15 per cent in the last year to about 200 worshipers a Sunday. The drop at Grace was considerably less, Dr. Mini fie said. Average Sunday at tendance there is about 250. Ascension has an endow, merit estimated at $1.5‐million na Grace one at $5‐million. The Church of the Ascension was founded in 1827. Its first edifice, on Canal Street, east of Broadway, burned to the greund in 1839. The, present, building is one of the earliest houses of wor ship designed, by Richard Up john, who was working on plans for the present Trinity Church, Broadway and Wall Street, at the same time. In 1929 the Church of the Ascension started its famous “open door” policy. For 30 years, the church never closed and a light burned all night long on the altar for out‐of towners, stragglers and those who simply wanted to pray. With changing times and values, the open door at night led to thefts and vandalism. The door was closed at night from time to time for the next several years. Today it is still open during the day but closed at night, probably permanently. Grace Church was founded in 1808, and the present edifice was constructed in 1847 under the architectural genius of James Renwick. The architect had submitted winning sketches for a new church on “upper Broadway at 10th Street.” The Gothic structure was so much admired that Mr. Ren wick was started on a success ful Career. In 1853 his designs were selected for St. Patrick's Cathedral. Until high society moved up town, Grace was considered the most. “fashionable” church in New York. It was facetiously called the “spiritual retreat of millionaires.” Ten years ago last month the church abolished its pew rental system, following a trend started by its equally “fashion able” sister churches, St. James', Trinity and Ascension.

1044-> BRITISH WORKERS MARCH IN PROTEST
LONDON, Feb. 21 — Thou sands of British workers carry ing banners and singing “We Shall Not Be Moved,” marched in central London today in a demonstration against the Con servative Government's labor policies. By late this afternoon, Victor Feather, the country's most powerful labor leader and gen eral secretary of the Trades Union Council, stood on a plat form in Trafalgar Square and shouted hoarsely: “This is the greatest demon stration London has ever seen, the greatest in this country. There are probably 150,000 people marching.” The police estimated that nearly 100,000 persons took part in the four‐hour protest against the Government's labor reform bill. The Government's proposal, which the workers denounced as “anti‐union poison,” would give Britain its first law on labor‐management relations, as the Wagner Act and the Taft Hartley Law did in the United States. It includes a long list of unfair labor practices by unions and employers, includ ing secondary boycotts and re fusal to bargain seriously. Labor relations here, in con trast with those in the United States since the nineteen‐thir ties, have always operated without any formal legislation with vaguely worded contracts not specifically enforceable in the courts. The new measure would make such contracts en forceable and is aimed at cut ting down on wildcat strikes. The singing, dancing demon strators, marching two miles from Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park to sunny Trafalgar Square, included miners in cloth caps women telephone operators pushing strollers, bearded uni versity radicals, Scottish rail waymen in kilts, printers from Manchester, steelworkers from Birmingham, textile workers from London. There were also pottery workers (“Smash the Crackpot Bill”) and actors (“‘Fiddler on the Roof’ opposes the Bill”) and striking postal workers linked arm‐in‐arm singing “I'm Only a Workin' Man.” Standing in Trafalgar Square and opening his arms toward the crowd, Sidney Green, gen eral secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen, shouted: “This is the most important demonstration held in London this century. We are united against this bill.” “It won't work,” said Michael Griffin, a Welsh miner for 35 years, as he helped hoist a multicolored banner in Hyde Park reading, “Penrhiwceiber Lodge Opposes the Bill.” He shook his head. “You can't resolve industrial disputes with legislation,” he said heat edly. “You can't block the unions like that. The employ ers can only benefit from this, not us.” Several yards away on the muddy grass, 47‐year‐old Louis Batting, a shop steward at the Ford Motor Company, whose workers are on strike, said bit terly: “The Tories, the bloody Tories. They never gave a damn about the working man and they still don't.” Although today's demonstra tion was called to protest the labor bill, the march rapid ly developed into a rally against Prime Minister Edward Heath's Conservative Govern ment. Marching past the Hilton Hotel on Park Lane and waving good‐naturedly at the guests and chambermaids peering from windows, the demonstrators shouted: “Tories out, Tories out.” Thousands of striking postal workers, many of them in uni form, led the march and sold printed postcards for 24 cents for the union's hardship fund. The cards, addressed to Mr. Heath, read: “Post office work ers having a raw time. Wish you were fair.” The postmen, who have halt ed mail service for five weeks, asked marchers to sign the cards and place them in a giant box en Trafalgar Square for a “special union delivery” to Downing Street. The postmen and other trade unionists are especially bitter at the Government's anti‐infla tion policy of driving down the level of wage settlements. In the postal strike, for ex ample, the Government has Imade a 9 per cent wage offer, while the Union of Post Office Workers is de manding 13 per cent for its 200,000 members, who earn from $43.20 to $66 a week in basic pay. During and after the march, however, a mood of ebullience and even carnival festivity en gulfed both the demonstrators and the passers‐by. At Trafal gar Square, a choir of elderly trade unionists sang “When We Find that Long Lost Homeland in the Sky.” On Park Lane, past the Playboy Club, women danced and a group of men sang “Take Me Home Again Kathleen.” At Hyde Park, as the march ers gathered, a union leader with a little boy beside him, shouted through a microphone: “Mr. Wilson ... Mr. Wilson... We've got your ever‐lovin son Lester and the boy says he's lost Mr. Wilson... Wilson....

1045-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: A recent column by Tom Wicker and the March 26 letter from Leslie P. Hemry (Health Insurance Association) on the question of a national health insurance program, raise several very fundamental questions that will soon have to be resolved by the American people through Congress. First, do we want a “national health program” operated by the Government or do we want a so‐called “national health insurance plan” operated by the private insurance industry? If we elect the first option then it may develop that we will also have to tolerate some of the bureaucratic practices that Government is capable of inflicting on us. However, if we elect the second option then we will probably soon realize that the bureaucracy in the private sector is equal to or greater than that of government. One need look no further than the Medicare Program which is administered by third party intermediaries (the American Medical Association and the Congressional code word for the insurance industry) to confirm this opinion. Second, should we permit tax dollars for health care of the American people to be subverted to profits by the private insurance industry or is the health care of the nation so vital that it does require direct government supervision and responsibility. It seems to me that any reasonable and objective study of the two alternatives must conclude that too much is at stake to entrust the health of our people to the private sector. We have a national health crisis primarily because we have historically relied on private industry as exemplified by the medical profession, the hospital system, Blue Cross and other insurance companies to determine the kind and quality of our medical care, how health services should be delivered and which beneficiaries should receive what kind of care. Since private industry has already failed us and virtually brought health care financing to the brink of fiscal bankruptcy, it appears that the only hope is a national plan which will establish our health priorities and also have the necessary clout to bring about changes so that the providers’ interest will be relegated to second place. It is about time that we placed the health of the nation ahead of the pecuniary interests of the health establishment. WILLIAM J. TAYLOR Secretary Treasurer, Local 1199 Drug and Hospital Union New York, March 29, 1971

To the Editor: “BLOOD,” says the double‐sized sticker in shouting capitals. What? Tired Blood? Bloody Mary? Blood n Guts? No. On second glance, you read the smaller letters, “giving BLOOD saves lives,” and still smaller, “United States Postage.” The thing is a sixcent stamp, put out to celebrate “Blood Donor Month.” And the other day another six‐cent Issue arrived — a lamb and mamma sheep, nuzzling—"America's Wool.” It brought to mind the fairly recent Natural History series of wild animals and reptiles—items on which you'd need to be selective, not to send to the wrong addressee. These suggest that we look out for what may be in preparation for us, perhaps Mother Eve without figleaf to promote National Apple Month, or Lydia Pinkham for Health Month, or Happy Hooligan, honoring the comic strip, all for the peace and dignity of the United States of America. A circular on the Post Office bulletin board credits some of these special stamps to a Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee. May one ask that the Post Office, obviously too busy to catch absurd and tasteless approvals from the committee, try to improve matters by appointing a new committee? While considering, they might even give whirl to George Washington again. GEORGE BRITT New York, March 25, 1971

1048-> Renata Scotto Shows Artistry in Met's ‘Rigoletto’
Since Verdi's “Rigoletto” was performed by the Metropolitan Opera last season, the return of the work on Tuesday night was not a momentous occasion, but the performance was not without interest. It offered Renata Scotto's first appearance here as Gilda, Rigoletto's hapless daughter. Somewhat on the plump side and the possessor of an assertive soprano voice that can take on a rather piercing edge, Miss Scotto is perhaps not ideally suited to the part of Gilda, but her artistry as both singer and actress made her impressive in it. The only point, in fact, at which she did not succeed was that at which she tried for an overkill. This was in the “Caro name,” which, if it had gone the way she wanted it to, would have been sensational. She accomplished some lovely effects, including upward portamentos that were uncommonly beautiful, but these were offset by interrupted tones and other little mishaps that kept the aria as a whole from being the model of vocal perfection she had aimed for. James Morris's portrayal of Monterone was noteworthy. This part is not large, but Mr. Morris made it seem unusually strong and imposing. It was his first time in the assignment. Most of the cast was familiar from performances in other seasons. Cornell MacNeil was the Rigoletto, and his excellence was dimmed only by a tendency to sharp slightly when the singing and emotions were intense. Giacomo Aragall, the Duke, had the opposite problem. He sagged on the underside of the pitch when pushing for high tones, but was otherwise commendable. Justino Diaz was the properly menacing Sparafucile, and Joann Grillo was Maddalena. Carlo Franci conducted.

1049-> Moods of Farewell Mark Dance Works At the Theater Lab
Farewells, some long and clingy and others tossed by ironic sentiments and angular contrasts were the preoccupation Friday evening on Choreoconcerts Experimental Workshop program at the American Theater Lab. The moods varied but the individual approaches were clear and provocative. Stuart Hodes paid his homage to the inevitability of passing life with folds of velvet movement in “The Honor of Your Presence Is Requested.” Totally contrasting was Dana Wolf's adieu to the childhood world of windup toys and joys in “I Never Loved Anybody and I Never Will.” Dressed in a man's suit she fired imaginary shots from her pointed finger at the toys' vacated spots while her alter ego, Sandra Roll, did a slow ballet barre in the background. With only a momentary backward glance she dashed off after incorporating some of the ballet movement and a few mechanical twitches into her own movement synthesis. Laura Foreman's “glass and shadows” was a dance for seven girls with a film and sound collage. The latter created an impression of recent hstory so powerful that it vied strongly with the dance for attention. And the dancers' molecular insularity from the emotional nature of the music and film was so total that it set up a violent tension in the work. Shawn Avrea's “Love Only Me, For There Is None Other” wittily contrasted the performer's idealistic coaching and his onstage mugging, and Charlotte Honda presented a flowing movement trio “Transitions.”

1051-> Supreme Court, by 8 to 1, Rules Against Thrift Units on Taxes
WASHINGTON, June 14 (UPI) —The Supreme Court ruled to 1 today that some 4,500 state‐chartered savings and loan associations are not entitled to claim tax deductions on millions of dollars in premiums they were assessed by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. More than half of the associations had challenged an Internal Revenue Service ruling to this effect and filed claims for refunds totaling $72.5‐million in taxes and $22million in interest as of last year. In an opinion by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the Court held that an “additional premium” assessed savings and loan associations by the National Housing Act was not deductible for income‐tax purposes as an ordinary and necessary business expense. justice William O. Douglas dissented. The Court acted in the test case brought by the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of San Francisco, which claimed a deduction of $882,636 that was disallowed by the I.R.S. but upheld by the United States tax court. On the association's appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court in San Francisco, the tax decklelion was allowed. The Supreme Court reversed this and reinstated the I.R.S. decision. Regular annual premium payments to insure depositors’ accounts are tax deductible, but since the 1962 law was passed, savings and loan associations have had to make additional yearly prepayments with respect to future premiums. The Supreme Court agreed with the tax court that such payments were not in the nature of a business expense but served to create and enhance an asset. League Is Disappointed Norman Strunk, executive vice president of the United States Savings and Loan League, said yesterday that the Supreme Court's decision had come as a “bitter disappointment” to the industry. He added, however, that the decision would have little or no financial impact on mutual (that is, depact on mutual (that is, depositor‐owned) associations, and only limited impact on those with stockholder ownership.

1052-> OBSERVER
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15—Isn't there anybody left in the United States who feels himself the victim of injustice? The question comes to mind because of the heavy volume of complaint lately in which spokesmen for the American discontented, speaking for large ill‐defined constituencies, talk about their oppression. No group with an axe to grind is socially aggrieved these days, or politically abused, or economically cheated. They are invariably opDressed. What they really are, of course, is afflicted; they are suffering from the fearful late twentieth‐century epidemic of verbal bloat. The victim of verbal bloat is incapable of saying that the economic short‐changing the country has given him is “injustice”; he must call it “oppression.” Verbal bloat is often justified by its sufferers on ground that the only way to draw attention to a grievance these days is to scream, pound the table and blow up the chicken house. In short, by abandoning reason. The people who argue this line are usually the same people who complain that the world is becoming an insane asylum. There are practical reasons for rejecting their defense. The overstated argument distracts attention from the merits of the case and focuses it, instead, on the absurdity of the overstatement. Man's first landing on the moon, for example, was a splendid event, but when President Nixon, in a seizure of verbal excess, called it the greatest happening since Creation, silliness threatened to break out all over. There are differences between Creation and mankind's splendid moments, one of them being a certain weight within the word “Creation” which leaves us feeling that it was an event beyond man's capacity to duplicate. In the same way, there are differences between injustice and oppression. Oppression is another word of great weight, but here the sense of weight is cold, cruel, stoney, the weight of pyramids bearing down on a humanity without hope of mercy or justice. Is it this hopelessness that we are supposed to feel when women liberationists speak of the “oppression” of women in the United States? Surely not. A sensible case exists that women as a group are subject to certain unjust exploitations. Fine. Let's do something about it. One good way to distract attention from the justice of doing something about it, however, is to bring up the subject of “oppression.” Here is a typical example of how verbal bloat works to damage the cause it professes to serve. First, the disinterested mind, which might have been hospitable to correcting injustice, is sidetracked into pondering the vast stoney weight of the word “oppression.” “Oppression,” it muses. “Slaves toiling hopelessly for Pharaoh with no hope this side of death. Surely the women I encounter are in no such predicament. Neither, surely, can be these women who are writing books, telling the television audience and complaining to newspapers that they are oppressed. Oppressed people are not permitted to write books and have no access to either television or press.” Somebody, this methodical mind may conclude, is doing an outrageous overselling job in the manner of TV salespitchery, which minds everywhere have learned to discount at huge rates for nonsense. Is it fair, then, to slander those who conclude, “Women's liberation? Oppression? Baloney!” Another unhappy result, of course, is to leave American men with a sense of discontent. If they are to think of American women as “oppressed,” they must inevitably inquire, “Who is the oppressor?” The answer they are likely to supply for themselves is: “American men; to wit, me!” Now it is very hard for the average American man to take very seriously the idea of himself as oppressor. His knowledge of oppressors has been formed by Cecil B. DeMille. An oppressor is an overweight fellow, usually wearing sheets or metal, who lies around on cushions drinking wine and being fed grapes by beautiful slave girls. Periodically, he snaps his fingers and has somebody tortured. Nobody at this stage of television criticism needs to be reminded how much at variance this is with the true role of the American man. Oppressor? He might love to be. But what is he, in fact? With excessive self‐pity but some justification, he tells himself, “Bill‐payer! Woman‐server! Child‐supporter! House‐lackey!” And so on. Of course it's foolish, but that's not the point. The aim was to stir him to fight injustice. The result has been to make him yearn for the oppressor's stone.

1053-> ‘CROWN JEWELS’ GIVEN AT CUBICULO
Spring is the season when new operas bloom all over the place, most of them doomed to wither and die, never to be seen again. Their production does give librettists and composers a chance to tackle a form that is supposedly dying, and out of them, hopefully, will develop some creative artists to flourish in the future. At the tiny Cubiculo Theater there has been showing recently a slight opera called “Who Stole the American Crown Jewels?” Its text is described as surreal, its musical form as a Singspiel. The description is accurate. Like many operas, its plot defies retelling. The characters include a king and queen, who are children; a man and woman who change sex; a mermaid; a Mrs, Woman, Mother Of Us All, who kills her son, Sunshine Soldier, who is resurrected as a soldier. There are glimmerings of symbolism, too faint to this writer to matter. Also like many operas, the book ends up as an excuse on which to hang the music. Whereas Jean Reavey's libretto seems humorless (the audience admittedly enjoyed it), Norman Siegel's score is moderately witty. It contains parodies, distortions and pastiches of everything—hymns, popular songs, baroque arias, Gilbert and Sullivan, Menotti operas, ballads. Some of the original tunes are graceful and charming. Mr. Siegel is a junior in Harvard's music department, and he is deft enough to suggest a future in the lyrical theater, be it Broadway or otherwise. At the performance on Friday night, Alice Dutcher made the most of the best role, Loretta Mermaid, who sings in Poulenc fashion about violins and cellophane. Don Jones, Elinor Ellsworth, Kevin Campbell, Beth Glick, Lydia Edwards and Peter Ludwig were capable in the other parts. Mimi SternWolfe conducted from the piano.

1056-> ENEMY ATTACKS NEAR PNOMPENR
PNOMPENH, Cambodia, Wednesday, June 9 (Reuters)— North Vietnamese troops struck hard at Government forces yesterday in a new attempt to seize the marshy eastern ap proaches to Pnompenh. The Cambodian high com mand said preliminary reports showed that at least 80 Govern ment soldiers had been killed or wounded in fierce fighting near Prey Thom, 12 miles northeast of the capital. A spokesman said Govern ment forces had been conduct ing a sweep in the area when they were attacked by about 1,500 North Vietnamese troops. A rocket and mortar barrage, he said, was followed by ground attacks in waves, result ing in hours of hand‐to‐hand combat. Fighting was still reported going on at nightfall. The new enemy attack ended a four‐day lull. Before that there had been 10 days of sus tained North Vietnamese at tacks along a 10‐mile front across the Mekong River from Pnompenh. The marshy area being fought over, known as the Vihear Suor, is part of the outer defense of Pnompenh. The North Vietna mese have been trying to seize it, military sources said, to bring the Cambodian capital within range of heavy‐mortar fire. During the recent lull, intelli gence reports reportedly indi cated that the command post of the Ninth North Vietnamese Division had been moved up to the front along with troop re inforcements. In the 10 days of fighting before the lull, more than 400 North Vietnamese and 200 Gov ernment troops were reported killed. A Government spokesman said that the Cambodians in volved in the latest battle were elements of the elite First and Seventh Regiments, both made up of Vietnamese‐born Cam bodians trained by United States Green Berets.

1057-> U.N. Responsibility Sought
LONDON, June 8 — The For eign Secretary said today that the responsibility for the ref ugees flooding into India from East Pakistan “must be as sumed by the United Nations.” Speaking in the House of Commons, Sir Alec Douglas Home estimated numbers of refugees at “upwards of 4,000,000.” He said that the size of, the problem required coordina tion and direction by a central body. The Indian Government, he said, has responded with “generosity and resources butt clearly the burden is such that, it must not rest solely on them.” Sir Alec warned that there was a possibility of “wide spread starvation.” “Plans must be made by the Pakistan Government in cooporation with the United Nations coordinator urgently to antici pate this need,” he declared. Sir Alec's statement appeared to reflect a desire by the British Government to get an outside body into East Pakistan in the hope that it would be a moderating influence on Pakistani army operations.

1058-> Radicals in Berkeley Angered by Defeat
BERKELEY, Dec. 15—The appointment by the Berkeley City Council of a moderate to its vacant seat, breaking a 4 to 4 deadlock between radicals and moderates, touched off angry criticism yesterday by the radical council members. Susan Hone, allied with liberal Democratic groups that are considered moderate by the radical council members, was appointed late last night as Mayor Warren Widener joined the Council's four moderates in supporting her. Mr. Widener, who was elected as an ally of the radicals, was accused by the three radical council members of failing to consult them before the appointment and of making a deal with the moderates. Mr. Widener denied that he had made any deal with the lour moderates on the council. He said he did not consider himself obligated to agree with the three other radicals. He added that the three had refused to endorse him formally do April because of his opposition to a controversial plan for a separate police force in Berkeley. Mr. Widener and the three radicals have become steadily disenchanted with each other since June, when Mr. Widener voted for a resolution to continue finding city operations on an interim basis. The radicals opposed the measure. Mr. Widener has been particularly critical of two of the radical council members, D'Army Bailey and Ira T. Simmons, for what he regards as obstructionist tactics. The Mayor said that Mrs. Hone had a progressive record and had endorsed him in his race last spring for Mayor, but she had not endorsed the three other radicals. Mrs. Hone yesterday said she could not commit herself on any of the issues currently before the council, such as a program for the hiring of blacks and women or reform of the Police Department. The appiontment of Mrs. Hone Is expected to end the 4 to 4 split, which has often deadlocked the council because five votes are required for passage of any motion. For instance, Mr. Widener and the three radicals, by withholding their votes for formal approval of the budget last September, were successful in forcing a freeze on city hiring until a program for the hiring of more blacks and women in city positions was adopted. However, the council has been unable to pass a program because of moderate opposition, and moderates in turn have been unable to end the freeze. Supporters of the radicals expressed shock and dismay at Mr. Widener's vote for Mrs. Hone. “The campus community is a very large part of the Mayor's constituency and Mr. Widener owed a student a voice in the issue.” Larry Seidman, student president at the University of California campus here, said. The split among the four is expected to make it difficult for radicals to agree on a slate in 1973, when the seats of four moderate council members, including that of Mrs. Hone, will be at stake.

1059-> Staff at 2 Papers In Chicago Protest Support for Daley
CHICAGO, March 17 —Most of the city reporters and edi tors at The Chicago Daily News and Sun‐Times have signed petitions criticizing the Field newspapers' endorsement of Mayor Richard J. Daley for a fifth term and asking for an opposing staff‐written editorial. The afternoon Daily News editorial appeared in today's editions. The Sun‐Times en dorsement is to appear in to morrow morning's papers. The staffs of both papers had expected that Marshall Field 5th, the publisher, would endorse Mayor Daley over Re publican‐Independent Richard E. Friedman in the April 6 elec tion, but were surprised by the early timing of the editorials. Several reporters and editors at The News had been working on a petition arguing against an endorsement of the Mayor. When they learned that the editorial was scheduled for to day, they hastily drew up a statement. At The Sun‐Times, the petition was written today. Reporters and editors at The News said that 90 persons had signed their petition, while 11 had declined. In The Sun‐Times city room, the petition had gained 61 signatures by mid afternoon, and reporters there said that nearly everyone asked had signed. The Daily News petition said, “We believe that an editorial endorsement of Mayor Daley would be inconsistent with the previous editorial stands that The Daily News has taken on such issues as public housing, public transportation, public schools and human relations.” The Sun‐Times petition simi larly contended that a Daley endorsement would “contradict previous editorial positions of this newspaper on such issues as housing, race relations and education.”

1060-> Housing in East New York Postponed by the City
The Lindsay administration postponed plans yesterday to seek approval for the construction of 16 two‐family houses for low‐income tenants in a middle‐class section of East New York, Brooklyn. Attributing the postponement to, “community opposition,” a spokesman for the city's Housing Authority said the proposal would be resubmitted to the City Planning Commission at a future date, but he declined to say when. The 16 houses were dropped from a larger, 66‐house project being considered by the Planning Commission yesterday. The 50 houses that remained on the commission's calendar are to be built on scattered sites in a largely black and Puerto Rican area west of Fountain Avenue. The other 16, east of Fountain Avenue, “were the toughest ones, where community opposition was most serious,” according to the Housing Authority spokesman. The tactic now will be to submit the 50 and the 16 as separate proposals, the spokesman said, to avoid the possibility that all, the housing would be jeopardized by the opposition to building for lowincome families in middle‐class areas. That opposition has been heightened in recent weeks by protests over an 840‐unit lowincome project under construction in Forest Hills, Queens. According to Richard Cherry, deputy director of housing for the New York Urban Coalition, which is sponsoring the projects in East New York, city officials that because of the Forest Hill protests, this is not the best time to be proposing other similar housing. Later, Mr. Cherry said, “The City Planning Commission and the Board of Estimate might be a little less gun‐shy.” The Planning Commission gave its approval to a number of other projects, including an 11‐story, 130‐unit low‐income apartment house in the Morris Park section of the Bronx. The commission also made mapping and zoning changes for athletic facilities in connection with the new 7,600‐seat John F. Kennedy Educational Park in the Bronx near the Manhattan border, and mapping changes to allow for the construction of Public School 78 in the. Oakwood Beach section of Staten Island. A Taxi Commission official also told the Planning Commission that a spot check of 100 cabs, in recent months had found that in 70 of them pollution‐control valves had been disconnected. The official, Alexander J. Mautner, director of technical control for the commission, was appealing for $1.2‐million for a city‐run inspection station where each cab would be inspected for safety three times a year. Part of the check, Mr. Mautner said, would be for pollution valves, which recirculate crankcase exhaust to reduce the car's pollution of the air. He said cabbies often disconnected the valves because they produce a moment of hesitation when the driver is trying to accelerate. “A New York cabbie always thinks he's losing money if he can't make the next light,” Mr. Mautner observed.

1061-> Theater: Bad Play With Good Parts
Most bad plays are indel ibly bad. They have badness like a taint, and everything is touched by it. From the first curtain the sensitive soul starts to cringe and turn up at the edges. But there are some few—that unlucky few —bad plays that have a touch of good in them. This kind of bad play, written by El liott Caplin, opened last night at the Gate Theater. It was called, for some unfathomable reason, “Any Resemblance to Persons Living or Dead . . .” It is the kind of title danger ously easy for critics to make jokes about, but I desist. • The play is about Lars, who has achieved the infinite felicity of the infinite — he was God, eternal and omnip otent. How did he become God? Simple: He conquered first wealth, then knowledge, then religion and then poli tics. Then he did something clever with a machine that could, for example turn a Ne gro into a Jew. And bingo! Before you knew where he was, he was God. The story is a fable. A feeble fable. Lars walks through the world conning it and giving its people what they want, or else merely tricking them. The fable, un fortunately, has no innards. It has been gutted of fact, if indeed it had any guts to start with. There will always be room for allegories—no zoo is complete without one, let alone the banks of the Nile —but what is being allegor ized must be coherent, origi nal and meaningful. The emp tily invisible inner substance of “Any Resemblance to Per sons living or dead . . . “ failed on all three counts. It was an allegory that seemed to have lost its way and spent the whole play crying silent symbolic tears for its keeper. What was quite good was the writing of individual scenes as Lars journeyed on his Odyssey for the godhead. His encounter with Anastasia Romanoff had a certain abrasive wit. Even though, after this first scene, the play steadily subsided like a grounded, deflating dirigible, there were quite a few other moments of possible passi bility. There was also the stag ing and the acting. The pro duction was elaborate and good. I admired the setting by Donald Padgett, and even more the costumes by David Toser. Loukas Skipitaris's di rection was brisk and helped, I thought, to alleviate the playwright's longueurs, by concentrating on his genuine ironic wit and comic inver sions. The casting and acting were generally excellent. It was definitely a better than usual off‐Broadway cast. • As Lars, the insufferable hero, Marc Alaimo had a cer tain raffish distinction, and I liked the freshly scrubbed sexuality of Joanne Dusseau as most of the women in his life. There were also some splendid character actors, splendidly character acting. They included Ruth Warrick embossed with diamonds as the richest woman in the world. Ted Thurston bluster ing merrily as a blithely ve nal politician, and Matthew Tobin as an irascible, randy, 127‐year‐old wheel‐chaired genius. But the play itself was not the thing. And isn't our the ater a little too old, even a little too grown up, for party games?

1062-> Garr, at. 379, Oli All‐Star List; Needs Write‐In to Make Team
Ralph Garr not only has taken Rico Carty's place in left field for Atlanta, but also has succeeded him as the season's early sensation who must rely on write‐in ballots to make the All‐Star team. Garr, like Carty last year, was the top hitter left off the list of nominees for the July 13 night game in Detroit between the American and National Leagues. The fleet outfielder, who opened the season in left for the Braves with Carty side lined by an injury, was hitting .379. Carty, a torrid hitter early last season, who went on to win the league batting title, was left off the 1970 list, much to the embarrassment of baseball officials. However, the resulting pub licity alerted the fans, who did the voting, and Carty easily won a starting berth through write‐in ballots. Garr, however, might not have such an easy time. Carty was an established player; Garr entered this season unheralded after several trials with Atlan ta. He also must battle such known stars as his teammate, Hank Aaron; Willie Mays of San Francisco, Pete Rose of Cincinnati, Willie Stargell and Roberto Clemente of Pitts burgh, Rusty Staub of Mon treal, Billy Williams of Chi cago, Lou Brock of St. Louis and Willie Davis of Los An geles, all named on the ballot. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn said yesterday that balloting would begin Friday in 150 major and minor league parks and thousands of retail outlets throughout the country. Voting ends June 30. The fans will choose the starting lineups, exclusive of pitchers. The managers will pick the pitchers and reserves.

1064-> Prague Revives a Noble 1750 Mass
PRAGUE, May 24—It has not been all opera at the Prague Spring. Two other as pects of music in Czechoslo vakia, representing a span of about 200 years, provided an interesting contrast over the weekend. A concert Saturday after noon at St. Vitus Cathedral offered the Missa Solemnis by Frantisek Xaver Brixi. He was a Bohemian baroque composer, and this work was composed around 1750. Yes terday, in the hall of the Prague Conservatory, there was a concert of avant‐garde music, mostly by Czech com posers. Czech musicologists and musicians in recent years have been taking a great deal of interest in Brixi. Not much is known about him, but he seems to have been active in Poland as well as in Bohemia, and he left a large amount of music that is currently being sorted out. Jindrich Rohan, who conducted the Prague Symphony Orchestra and Czechoslovak Radio Choir in this concert, believes that this was the first per formance since Brixi's day. The work itself was well worth resurrecting. It is a large‐scale, mobile piece of music very much in the Bach style, with sure contrapuntal writing, powerful choruses and expressive vocal solos. Brixi was clearly an impor tant composer, ranking just below the towering figures of Bach and Handel. The work received a fine performance. Mr. Rohan is one of the most respected conductors in Czechoslo vakia, and for this occasion he had a fine vocal quartet. Jana Jonasova, Libuse Maro va, Miroslav Svejda and Karel Hanus were the singers. The singing of the radio choir was absolutely flawless, both in the Brixi and in the other work on the program, Verdi's four Sacred Pieces. Prague was inundated by a heavy rain all day Saturday, but that did not prevent about 3,000 people from at tending the concert. St. Vitus Cathedral was jammed. It was a thrill to hear the sacred music in the most important Bohemian cathedral. St. Vitus is one of the great gothic structures of Europe—huge, narrow, vaulted, old, grim, beautiful, inspiring. The orchestra played in front of a screen at up before the altar. Golden saints and angels, mounted on the tre mendous pillars, looked down at the musicians. So did the images of ancient Bohemian kings and mighty warriors, in front of their crypts. For the contemporary music concert next day, about 200 people turned out, which is par for most avant garde music anywhere. The concert was given by the group named Musica Viva Pragensis. This was founded 10 years ago by the com poser‐conductor Zbynek Vos trek, in emulation of the Do maine Musicale concerts of Pierre Boulez in Paris, The idea was to get the best in strumentalists in Prague to specialize in the difficult con temporary idiom, with unlim ited rehearsal time and total dedication. The aim has succeeded. Musica Viva is a small group of perfectly trained musicians that can rank with any com parable group anywhere. All the music they played yester day under Mr. Vostrak's di rection had the usual difficult components of the interna tional avant‐garde—serialism, aleatory, electronics, frac tured vocalism and they handled everything with com plete nonchalance. Music by three Czech com posers and two outsiders was played. Argentina was rep resented by the “Auftrag” of Carlos Roque‐Alsina, and the Soviet Union by the “Con cordanza” by Sofia Asgatova Gubajdulina. The Argentine piece started with slowly shifting sound masses. Then the musicians themselves got into the act, grouping around the bass player and having a little fun. On the whole the piece was an inconsist ent, half‐baked effort. The Gubajdulina work turned out to be a 10‐minute collection of avant‐garde predicabilities. • Local composers included Mr. Vostrak, with a piece named “Tao,” and Marek Kopelent, whose “Snehah” was the only work on the program that included tape accessories. There also was a short, rather dry piece by the late Jan Rychlik. The Vostrak work employed massed dissonance and an exploration of walloping per cussion sonorities. Mr. Kope lent's “Snehah,” with the so prano Milada Boublikova, is in the Berio style, with taped speech sounds. Most of the music sounded pretty much like what every body else was writing four years ago. A close examina tion of the program notes, printed in Czech, revealed that most of the music ac tually was written four years ago. Which showed that the Czech composers were per fectly au courant with the international trends, as they still are. They are, however, wor ried that they may not be allowed complete freedom in the future. Only a few weeks ago Gustav Husak, First Sec retary of the Communist party in Czechoslovakia, said something to the effect that the arts would have to be brought under discipline. His remark has scared the life out of Czech intellectuals.

1065-> INFLATION LINKED TO JOBLESS LEVEL
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13—The Government is showing in creasing interest; combined with concern, in new studies show ing that the United States in the present decade is likely to have far more inflation when employment is low than was the case in the 1950's and early 1960's. Ultimately, officials concede, the situation could lead to a decision to aim at an unemploy ment “target” somewhat higher than the long‐held goal of 4 per cent of the labor force. No such decision has yet been made, and the problem does not arise for this year, when the aim is to reduce unemploy ment from its abnormally high present level of 6 per cent. The latest and most promi nent of the studies on the worsening “trade‐off” between unemployment and inflation was by George L. Perry of the Brookings Institute. Mr. Perry found that the up ward pressure on wages, as em ployers bid for workers, is about as great now at 5.5 per cent unemployment as it was at 4 per cent unemployment in the mid 1950's. The reason is a drastic change in the United States labor force. Young persons, up to age 24, now form a far higher portion of the total labor force than they used to, and also a higher portion of unemployment. Mr. Perry finds, in effect, that an unemployed youth does not exert the same downward pressure on wages as an un employed prime‐age adult male. Put another way, the labor market for prime‐age males is about as tight today when the over‐all unemployment rate is 5.5 per cent as it was with 4 per cent unemployment 10 or 15 years ago. And it is this tightness that largely determines how rapidly wages will rise, not union‐bar gained settlements, which cover only one‐fourth of the labor force. A long‐standing historical cor relation exists between the rise in average wages, less the in crease in productivity, or output per man‐hour, and the rise in the average price level. Mr. Perry concludes that if the economy should stabilize at 4 per cent unemployment in the early 1970's, the resulting infla tion would be 4.5 per cent a year. This is much higher than the 2.8 per cent inflation asso ciated with 4 per cent unem ployment in the 1950's. A broadly similar conclusion was drawn by a study issued late last year by the Urban Research Institute. If the “trade‐off” in the United States has worsened as indicated, the problem for the Government is a difficult one. Essentially, it is whether to say openly that, in the interest of less inflation, the nation should learn to accept as “normal” a somewhat higher unemployment rate than in the past. One justification for such a view would be that there is less “hardship” associated with un employment among the young than with adult unemployment. Not only are their family re sponsibilities normally less but the duration of their unemploy ment is also less than among adults. A Labor Department study covering early 1969 showed that 60 per cent of unemployed teen‐agers—many looking for their first job—remained out of work for less than five weeks and 86 per cent remained out of work for less than 14 weeks. However, many economists, including Mr. Perry, do not con clude that the nation should accept a higher unemployment rate. Instead, they argue for various methods of, first, de creasing unemployment among the young and, second, slowing the rise in wages and prices without the “blunt” method of allowing chronic unemployment. The issue for Government could arise as early as next year. President Nixon's strategy for the economy this year calls for unemployment to be down to about 5 per cent by the end of the year. If wages, and hence prices, rise rapidly as the employment situation improves, a choice will have to be made. One aspect of the Perry study that has attracted attention both inside and outside the Government is, that this is about the only analysis that successfully predicted the large rise of 7 per cent in average hourly compensation last year at a time of relatively high, and rising, unemployment.

1066-> ANTA Plans Subsidies For Shows in Trouble
The American National Theater and Academy, the organization chartered by Congress that primarily has served as a theater‐informa tion service, is planning to come up with hard cash for financially troubled shows of artistic merit next season. Richard Barr, ANTA's president, said yesterday that ANTA was contemplating providing “up to $40,000 in cash” to at least three shows plus funds covering salary guarantees for performers and theater‐booking bonds. The plays will be selected by “a small ANTA board committee.” The productions are to be required to pay a nominal percentage of the profits, should there be any. These will not be “run‐of‐the mill” ventures, according to Mr. Barr. “They will com prise plays deemed financially risky on Broadway by back ers.” “It should be emphasized,” Mr. Barr said, “that we don't plan to produce on our own, but to aid producers of what we consider worthwhile prop erties.” “Most of the show will be done under the current “limited gross” contract ar rangement,” he said, and “it is our plan to charge a top of not more than $3.50 at the 1,214‐seat ANTA Theater, where the attractions will be housed.” ANTA has enough money on hand to underwrite three shows next October or No vember, according to Mr. Barr. The so‐called limited gross arrangement requires the establishiment of a $25, 000 limit on weekly gross for productions operating under terms of the arrangement. The selected attractions “will be allowed to have a Week of previews, if they so wish,” Mr. Barr said, “plus five weeks of playing time. After this they must move to another theater—whether on Broadway, off Broadway or on the road or anywhere they want to go.” If the stage venture is suc cessful, it will be required to pay ANTA 2 per cent of the weekly gross during profita ble weeks until production costs are recouped. After that, the payments will rise to 3 per cent and remain at that level as long as the show runs. The purpose of these pay ments, Mr. Barr said, is to re plenish ANTA's fund for as sisting financially stricken projects. “Essentially, what we are doing is lending the money to them. If they fail, they don't owe us anything.” Mr. Barr is hopeful that the ANTA plan will attract the attention and assistance of the Theater Development Fund, whose primary func tion is to help build new audiences for serious theater by buying tickets to commer cial products of artistic merit at below box‐office prices and redistributing them to students and teachers at $2 or $2.50. “The ANTA plan,” Mr. Barr said, “is a first concen trated effort to bring to bear all subsidies together in one fell swoop and to really sub sidize the legitimate theater. “We feel that an impor tant function of ANTA is to encourage more serious thea ter work in the Broadway area. The reason for this is that New York is really tht feeding ground for all legiti mate productions in the coun try.” Last year ANTA brought in several regional theater groups at the ANTA Theater. ANTA's funds come from private gifts, foundation grants and revenues from occasional productions and national touring companies. It is governed by a 15‐mem ber board of directors, which initially numbered more than 70.

1070-> For Garfield's, No More Noshes
A cavernous room with huge abstract mosaics. Mirrored walls. Marbleized floors. Enormous round pil lars where recessed ceiling lights glinted off encrusted gold, black and red designs. And then the food! Blintzes smothered in sour cream. Dark pumpernickel bread. Onion rolls Bialys. Lox. Cream cheese. Matzoh ball soup. Noodle pudding. Seltzer flowing freely. That was Garfield's. Last week the legend came to a close as the wares of the celebrated cafeteria on the corner of Flatbush and Church Avenues in Brooklyn were auctioned off. The cafe teria had closed its large double doors for the last time early the morning of July 6, after declining business had forced its demise. “The Stein brothers once owned Garfield's and when they had it, it was a success ful, famous restaurant,” said Frederick B. Scott, who is “going on 70” and says he has been a restaurateur since childhood. “The element was a fine class of people, but times have changed. Now It's a mixture. Now you were get ting anything from street peddler women to tramps.” Garfield's, in its heyday, was known throughout Brooklyn, mentioned in the same breath with Dubrow's on Eastern Parkway and Utica Avenue and Hoffman's on Pitkin and Saratoga Ave nues, which are also gone. These were the grand old cafeterias where a young boy could court his girl for hours over a chopped liver sandwich or young men and women, their cheeks flushed and their eyes agleam, could stop in at midnight for a nosh, or something to nibble on, after leaving the Alber marle dance parlor or to re cover from the hilarity of vaudeville at the Flatbush Theater. “After the Flatbush Thea ter closed at night, I had to open up the double doors. There was no room. They would all come to get coffee and cake,” said Bill Prokop, night manager at Garfield's since 1935. Then—even later—as dawn spread quietly over Flatbush, the truck drivers would come in and the horse players, sitting in one particular cor ner, scowling over their Morning Telegraphs. But Garfield's really be longed to the old people. “The place was a real land mark, especially for older people,” said Albert Orzy, who lives on Ocean Avenue. “They lived in poor places and they would come here— especially on Saturdays and Sundays—to meet people and to talk and show pictures of their children and grandchil dren. “It was considered quite respectable for old people to meet and buy each other a cup of coffee and ask about their children. It was not considered a pickup.” Sometimes elderly people would bring their own lunches and spread them out on the tables and even help themselves to Garfield's mus tard, sugar, salt and pepper. Sometimes they sat for hours on end in front of nothing more than a cup of coffee. “Maybe they lived in a room and then they would come here and sit around all day and have a cup of coffee. Could they exist on that? Just a cup of coffee?” said Mrs. Eugenia Scherer, who has lived in the area since 1954. “Everybody came here. Like my daughter would say: ‘Momma, meet me at Gar field's’ and we used to have lunch,” she said. On Wednesday, the huge iron frying pans with bits of grease still on their bottoms, the copper kettles, the stain less steel bowls, the stacks of red and blue trays and the white dishes with the red and green stripes were auc tioned off in a brisk, busi ness‐like auction to restau rant suppliers. The old‐timers who had come simply out of nostalgia were turned away at the door. One man stood outside the door and shook his head. “The old folks lost a home here,” he said.

1071-> Pakistan Lists Toll of 78 More In Fighting in Eastern Region
KARACHI, Pakistan, Oct. 26 —Pakistan reported today that her army continued mopping up “Indian troops and agents” in the Kasba area of Comilla Dis trict in East Pakistan and as serted that 78 more bodies of “enemy” personnel had been found. The latest claim, in a com muniqué, brought to 579 the number of the enemy said by Pakistan to have been killed in two days. The communiqué, noting that India had said the Kasba area was under the control of the rebel Bengali forces, reiterated Pakistan's contention that all the territory in East Pakistan was under her control. Communiqués, which do not mention Pakistani military casualties, use the phrase “Indian agents” to describe the Bengali guerrillas in East Pakistan fighting the Govern ment. “Indian agents” are pre sumed to include villagers. The Government said that the shelling of border villages con tinued. While there is no doubt that shells fall on villages in East Pakistan, it is not always clear where they have come from. There are fairly frequent Pakistani Government reports that the district town of Co milla has been shelled by In dian artillery across the border, but an examination of the dam age indicated that the shells had usually come from 2‐inch mortars, whose range is not sufficient for firing across the border. Since military operations against Bengali separatists be gan in East Pakistan last March, the Pakistan Army has systematically reduced villages and other strongpoints. There have been artillery barrages and air strikes by American‐ built and Soviet‐built jet air craft. Monsoon flooding of East Pakistan's vast rice and jute fields has hampered the army. Amphibious operations have been helped by 50 light assault boats provided by the United States for cyclone relief and appropriated by the army last March. The monsoon is nearly ended and Government troops will presumably have greater mo bility now.

1072-> TENNIS CHALLENGES THE OLYMPIC CODE
LONDON, May 1 (AP)— World tennis officials have challenged the International Olympic Committee to think again about professional and amateur athletes to competing together. The International Lawn Ten nis Federation, which has been running open tournaments for pros and amateurs since 1968, is upset because the I.O.C. has struct the I.L.T.F. off the list of sports bodies “operating in accordance with Olympic stand ards.” Basil Reay, secretary of the I.L.T.F., said he had written a letter to the I.O.C. complaining that tennis was being penal ized for being honest. “The I.L.T.F. appeals to all sportsment throughout the world to see that hypocrisy is removed from all sport and to take steps to ensure that hon esty is not penalized,” Reay's letter said.

1073-> AIRMAN FIREBOMBED AND SHOT IN FLORIDA
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct. 2 (AP)—In a third night of racial violence here, a 19‐year‐old airman's car was firebombed and he was shot as he fled with his hair and clothes afire, witnesses said. Jim Howell said he and Debbie Robinson were driving home from a date early this morning when “some guy ran out and threw a firebomb” that landed in the car in front of them. The two guys jumped out: one guy's head was on fire and he was trying to get the fire out of his hair,” Miss Robinson, said. Mr. Howell said he had heard gunfire. “I thought they were firecrackers at first but the third one hit the guy who was on fire,” he said. Mr. Howell pulled his car up beside David Friedmann and James Plummer. He and Miss Robinson pulled young Plummer into the car. Another shot rang out. Young Friedmann jumped Ito his flaming auto and the two cars sped four blocks to a fire station. There, Mr. Plummer, a 19‐year‐old airman from Charleston, S. C., was rushed to a hospital. He was reported in serious condition late today. The incident was part of a series of violennt flare‐ups that have plagued the Inner city's black sections for three days. They began Wednesday when a black youth was killed and policeman wounded.

1076-> ‘Two Distinguished Nominations’
WASHINGTON—The Senate is now considering William H. Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell Jr. for the Supreme Court. A special genius of the American people has been a commitment to the rule of law, not of men; the Senate fulfills a Sacred duty in advisiing and consenting to the nominations submitted by the President. Three issues fate the Senate: (1) Do these nominees have personal tegrity? (2) do they possess professitinal competency? and (3) do they have an abiding fidelity to the Constitution? No Senator has a duty to vote to confirm any nomination forwarded by the Predident that cannot pass this test. In my judgment, that is what the decision is all about—not about the so‐called “Warren Court” or the “Burger Court” or even the “Nixon Court.” Those labels are the stuff of journalism, not conatitutional law. Since these nominations were announced. I have examined the public record of these two men without prejudgment. I would note that I have found nothing in the public record of either man that raises any question whatsoever of lack of integrity or competency. I am convinced that any challenge on either of those grounds. will utterly fair. There is room on the United States Supreme Court for liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, Northerners and Southerners, Westerners and Easterners, blacks and whites, men and women— these and Other similar factors neither qualify nor disqualify a nominee personal integrity and professional competency, what is crucial, in my Judgment, is the nominee's fidelity to the Constitution. In recent years a majority of the Supreme Court—no doubt in good faith but nonetheless with mistaken judgment—began to impose new standards. On the administration of criminal justice in the United States on both he Federal and state levels. These decisions, have not enforced the simple, rule that law enforcement agents must “live up to the Constitution” in the administration of justice. Instead, these cases have, to a significant degree, created and imposed on a helpless society new rights for the criminal defendants. Some of these new rights have been carved out of society's due measure of personal safety and protection from crime. Indeed, since 1960, in the criminal justice area alone, the Supreme Court has specifically overruled or explicitly rejected the reasoning of no less than 29 of its own precedents, often by the narrowest of five‐to‐four margins. In 1967, the high watermark of this tendency to set aside prece dent, the Court overturned no less than eleven prior decisions. Twenty one of the twenty‐nine decisions the Court overruled involved a change in constitutional doctrine—accomplished without invoking the prescribed procedures for the adoption of a constitutional amendment. Seven of these represented a new reading of old statutory language—accomplished without the intervening of Congressional action and Presidential approval. And this is the significant point: 26 of these 29 decisions were handed down in favor of a criminal defendant, us, ually one conceded to be guilty on the facts. The pursuit by some jurists of stract individual rights defined by ideology, not law, has threatened to alter the nature of the criminal trial from a test of the defendant's guilt or innocence into an inquiry into the propriety of the Policeman's conduct. In my judgment, these decisions, however well‐intentioned, have come at a most critical juncture of our nation's history and have had an adverse impact on the administration justice. Our system of criminal justice, state and Federal, is increasingly, being rendered more impotent in the face of an ever‐rising tide of crime and disorder. It is for these reasons that I, for one, welcome two distinguished nominations. I recognize, of course, that there are some who challenge these nominations, arguing that the Senate should reject them beause of the nominees' positions on such issues as confessions or wiretapping. Yet I have seen nothing that either nominee has said that is more critical of the work of the Supreme court in these areas than that which Justices Black and Harlan themselves have repeatedly voiced in dissent. I know, too, that the Senate, in processing the 1968 Crime. Act, voted 55 to 29 to limit the Impact of the Miranda rule on confessions, and 68‐to‐12 to authorize the use of court supervised wiretapping in major investigations: I cannot believe that these nominations should or will fail of confirination for these reresons. The people of the United States Citified the Constitution to establish justice, to insure domestic tranquillity and to secure the blessings of liberty. We must not emphasize one aspect of the Constitution to the exclusion of another. It not only wrongs the constitution but it will also ultimately jeopardize both the safety and the liberty of our people.

1077-> Nationalists Pledge Battle to Keep Place in World Bank and Other U.N. Agencies
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Oct. 26 — Nationalist China vowed today to fight to keep its place in the World Bank and a dozen other agencies with formal ties to the United Nations. Liu Chieh, the Nationalist representative who led his dele gation out of the General As sembly last night before it voted to expel his Government, said in an interview that the Taiwan ‐ based Nationalists would insist on continuing to be active in the agencies that deal with labor, health and economic aid. “We joined with Brazil in sponsoring the establishment of the World Health Organization 26 years ago,” he said. “We do not intend to withdraw.” He recalled that his Government was one of the original subscrib ers to the World Bank, formal ly called the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. “There seems to be a miscon ception among some diplomats here that because we withdrew froth the United Nations and its operations, it followed that we were leaving all other agencies,” he said, “We contributed almost $6‐ million last year to the agencies and we intend to fight to keep our place.” lie argued that each of the agences is “free to judge for itself” whether his Govern ment should remain and does not have to follow the lead of the Assembly. United Nations authorities agreed that the Assembly could only recommend — not oblige — the agencies to act but there was also a widely‐held view that the Nationalists will face a struggle to keep their status in most of the agencies. The agencies were set up as separate, autonomous organiza tions with their own member ship, staff budgets and execu tive bodies but maintain close working arrangements with the United Nations and submit re ports annually. Under a 1950 Assembly reso lution, it was agreed that, when controversies over membership arise, the agencies will “take account” of the Assembly's at titude — a phrasing that legal experts maintain is not binding. On their side, the pro‐Peking countries are certain to argue that the Assembly resolution, last night should apply to the agencies also because it calls for the Nationalists' expulsion “forthwith” from the United Nations aria “all the organiza tions related to it.” The Nationalists' chances are felt to be brightest in the World Bank and the related International Monetary Fund since there is only one Eastern European member, Yugoslavia. The United States and Japan, under a weighted voting sys tem, could be counted on to protect Taiwan's place. The Nationalists initially sub scribed $30.26‐million to the World Bank but also have benefitted from loans, mostly to finance agricultural projects and community development. A spokesman for the bank said the legal situation was being studied—including the question of ownership of the funds subscribed. The executive board of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organ ization was the first to react to the Assembly decision and called a meeting in Paris for Thursday to consider the “par ticipation of China in the execu tion of the program” being considered by the UNESCO board. However, no decision could come before the next UNESCO general conference scheduled for October, 1972, a spokesman here said. The World Health Organiza tion, with headquarters in Geneva, also will not have a meeting of its full membership until next year. The Chinese Nationalists also intend to participate as always in a number of other agencies, three in Geneva: the Interna tional Labor Organization, the International Telecommunica tions Union and the World Meteorological Organization. A spokesman for the Uni versal Postal Union in Berne said there was no reason that the Nationalists could not ob tain membership as the govern ment of Taiwan after Peking was admitted. Taiwan will continue to re ceive help from two of the United Nations' most success ful programs—the United Na tions Children's Fund and the United Nations Development Program. UNICEF has committed a $500,000 aid program for health services, family planning and education. A spokesman said there was no step being taken to stop the assistance as of now and that UNICEF gives its help to countries within and outside the United Nations. A $32‐million aid program for Taiwan was undertaken by the United Nations Develop ment Program but most of the projects for industrial help, land improvement and develop ment of resources have been completed. The United Nations allocated $13.3‐million and the Nationalist Government sup plied $18.7‐million. Twenty‐four experts remain in Taiwan and are at work on agricultural and vocational training projects, some sched uled to continue to 1975. The Nationalists customarily would attend the United Na tions Development Program's fund ‐ raising conference on Monday but Mr. Liu said they would not be present.

1078-> Wood, Field and Stream
Nearly complete reports on Maine's recent deer season indicate that this year's harvest may be slightly under 19,000 animals. This is a considerable drop from last year's total of 31,750, but officials of the state's Department of Inland Fisheries and Game had wanted a lighter kill because a series of bitter winters had been a major factor in reducing Maine's pre‐hunting 1971 deer herd to an estimated 94,800 animals. In recent years, the usual preseason deer population has been 212,000. This year, a new Maine law gave Maynard F. Marsh, Deputy Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Game, the authority to shorten or close the deer season in any area of the state if he felt that too many deer were being taken, and he did shorten the southern zone season by five days and the northern zone season by three days. Aware that many hunters plan their trip months ahead, Marsh said that he regretted having to make his announcement of shorter seasons after the hunting had begun. One part of the new law, which did not go into effect until Sept. 25 of this year, stipulates that any preseason announcement of an altered season has to be made before Sept. 1. Thus, Marsh was left with the second part of the law, which he used, which gives the Commissioner authority to terminate deer hunting if an emergency arises. In the future, Marsh said, the department would be free to make its announcements before Sept. 1. • The report on New Hampshire's deer season, which closed last Sunday, was that this year's harvest, 7,164, was nine more than the 1970 total. The New Hampshire deer herd had also been hurt by bitter winters and deep snow, last winter being one of the worst in a quarter of a century. The Fish and Game Department had hoped for lighter kill and had even shortened the season by few days with this in mind. However, two snowfalls, one light and one heavy, during the season produced good tracking conditions for hunters and the kill in the southern counties exceeded that of last year.

1079-> INTERNATIONAL UNIT OFFERS INDIA HELP
PARIS, Oct. 26—Thirteen na tions and five international or ganizations agreed here today to a worldwide effort to meet the cost of the growing refugee problem in India. The expenditure needed to care for the East Pakistanis who have fled into India was put at $700‐million until the end of next March, the end of the Indian fiscal year. It was agreed that such costs were creating an intolerable burden on India. The delegates meeting here at the European headquarters of the World Bank are involved financially in India's develop ment. Reports given by Dr. I. G. Patel of the Indian Ministry of Finance, by Charles Mace, the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees, and by World Bank officials, put the number of refugees at more than 9.5 million. Representatives of Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Den mark, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the Unit ed States attended the meeting with delegates from India, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Children's Fund, the High Commissioner for Refugees and the Organi zation for Economic Coopera tion and Development.

1080-> Conviction of a Mother For Lewdness Upheld
TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Dec. 8 (UPI)—The Florida Supreme Court upheld today the constitutionality of a laww‐under which a 30‐year‐old woman was sentenced for demonstrating the sex act to her 8‐year‐old son. The court ruled that the state's law against “lewd or lascivious” conduct was not vague, as charged. Mrs. Rebecca M. Chesebrough of St. Petersburg and the child's stepfather, Thomas Chesebrough, 52 years old, were charged after the, boy, told school friends that his parents were showing him how to make babies. The school authorities notified the juvenile authorities. At her trial on Jan. 5, 1971, Mrs. Chesebrough pleaded no contest to the charge of committing sexual intercourse in front of the child. She was sentenced to 6 to 18 months in jail and was released Dec. 1 after serving nearly 11 months. The husband has not been brought to trial, but the Pinellas County State Attorney's office said that he was committed to a state hospital March 8 as a “criminal, sexual psychopath.”

1081-> HEARINGS OPENED FOR KAHANE TRIAL
A patrolman who infiltrated the Jewish Defense League is to testify for the Government at the conspiracy trial of Rabbi Meir Kahane and about a dozen T.D.L. members. This was disclosed yesterday by an assistant United States attorney in Brooklyn Federal, Court during a pretrial hearing involving a Justice Department wiretap on the league. The attorney, Joseph Ryan Jr., appearing before Judge Jack B. Weinstein, contended that the wiretap was not the source of, any evidence to be used against the defendants, who are charged with conspiracy to make explosives and to trans port firearms across state lines. He said the Government's case would be based on in formation provided by the policeman, by an alleged J.D.L. member who cooperated with the authoriities, and by a Trea sury Department agent who had no knowledge during his in vestigation that a wiretap was being conducted by the internal security division of the Justice Department. Questioned by defense law yers, the agent, Elmer P. Rutherford, said that he learned of the wiretap only a few days ago, and that he had not obtained any leads in his investigation from members of the Justice Department. Mr. Rutherford, Who is with the Richmond, Va., office of the Treasury Department's Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms division, testified that he had checked the records of a Virginia gun she!) and subsequently learned the whereabouts of Gilbert Laurie, the alleged J.D.L. mem ber who was said to have co operated; with the authorities. Mr. Laurie was named as a co‐conspirator but not as defendant. Should the Government suc ceed, in showing that wiretap information did not produce any evidence being used in the case, the surveillance still could jeopardize the case be cause it continued after the indictments were issued. Judge Weinstein, when in formed by Mr. Ryan yesterday that the surveillance was still being conducted a few days ago, termed the disclosure “serious,” presumably because attorney client relationships might have been violated. However, he reserved judg ment on that matter and also on a defense request for tran scripts of all overheard conver sations. Only some of the transcripts have been made available to the defense. The hearing is to resume to morrow.

1083-> Advertising:
Many of the folks In De troit's marketing‐advertising media community didn't dis cover until yesterday that Ford announced late Friday it was moving three car lines out of J. Walter Thompson, the agency for the entire Ford Division for over 20 years. What added to their sur prise is that Detroit is ac customed to very stable agency‐client relations. They sort of have to be stable be cause the auto makers invest so much know‐how into their agencies and the agencies in vest so many people for the client. Adding to the excitement of the announcement is that Ford has not yet named the new agency for its Pinto Maverick and Mustang, with combined billings of some $17‐million. This allows for speculation, a favorite indus try sport. Grey Advertising seems to be mentioned frequently be cause it does the corporate advertising for the Ford Mo tor Company and the cam paign has reportedly pleased the client. It also did some of the pre‐introductory “teas er” advertising for the Pinto. Another agency mentioned, even though its Los Angeles office handles the recently introduced Japanese Mazda, Is Foote, Cone & Belding. This shop handled the ill fated Edsel for Ford, and despite the failure of the prod uct there was good client agency rapport. A long‐time Detroit watch er theorized yesterday that the “innovative, tough‐mind ed” Ford management asked itself, “what's our long range posture going to be?” Then it decided that there is a new market emerging in which the small car and the standard car are direct com petitors, that specialists must be created and separate ad igenoies retained. Apparently car‐less ad agencies have been making this pitch to Ford for a while. Or as one adman put it, “Detroit is finally discovering the segmented ap proach to the market.” There are those who be lieve that Ford will have to take its business to a middle to‐large agency that will maintain a Detroit office for the necessary day‐to‐day contact. A large agency is particularly needed if it is to handle the dealer associa tion advertising. Ford said yesterday that the dealer ad vertising was not Involved here, but that, of course, is up to the dealers. Thompson does the advertising for al most all of the 33 associa tions. One thing for sure, the phones of the advertising marketing people at the Ford division were busy yesterday with Detroit admen seeking further information from their contacts and from agency people trying to got a foot in the door. The word is that few of those calls were getting through—a lot of people in conference. Generally speaking, the loss of accounts by any of the few publicly‐held ad agencies has had little effect on their stock. When Miles Laboratories pulled its Alka Seltzer out of Dayle Dane Bernbach for the biggest switch in 1970, there was hardly a ripple. Yesterday, however, J.W.T. closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 51% off 4% from Friday's close. Having left his native Min nesota to learn the big‐city ways during 17 years at Ben ton & Bowles, Albert R. Whiteman returned to his home state to do 21 more years at Campbell‐Mithun. Now, apparently tired of hop ping from agency to agency, he is retiring. He and the agency have done all right during his stay. The agency has gone from $8‐million to $80‐anillion in billings and he's gone from executive vice president, to president to chairman of the executive committee. That's what that “go West” stuff is all about. International Business Ma chines, which has just had some top management changes, also has some not quite ‐ top management changes. Jane P. Cahill, for mer secretary of the manage ment review committee, has been named director of com munications and that gives her “company‐wide staff re sponsibility for information, advertising, promotion and internal communications.” She takes the place of Rich ard M. Wight, who has been reassigned at his request for “personal reasons.” Accounts Amchem Products, Inc., Am bler, Pa., division of the Rorer‐Amchem Corporation, to Lewis & Gilman, Inc. Philadelphia, for its in dustrial chemicals business. People Donald O. Keller named ex ecutive art director, Joe. DeVivo and Robert Nolan associate creative directors at the Leo Burnett Com pany, Inc., Chicago. Gerald L. Taylor elected vice president in charge of sales at Twenty First Century Communications, Inc. John G. Gelinas has rejoined the Thomas J. Deegan Com pany as executive vice president, director and chief operating officer.

1084-> Amtrak Makes Improvements in Long‐Haul Service
The National Railroad Pas senger Corporation, known as Amtrak, released new nation wide schedules of intercity pas senger trains yesterday includ ing improved long‐haul service. The schedule is the second since the quasi‐public corpora tion took over the job of run ning almost all of the nation's intercity (as distinct from com muter) trains May 1. Long‐haul improvements in clude a new connection at Kan sas City allowing east bound passengers on the Los Angeles‐to‐Chicago Super Chief streamliner to transfer to the St. Louis and New York‐bound Spirit of St. Louis. The connection in the other direction already existed. The schedule folder itself has been improved with the addi tion of non‐Amtrak passenger schedules — trains operated by the. Rio Grande, Southern and Rock Island railroads, which decided not to join the national corporation but whose trains connect with Amtrak. Amtrak said that all intercity passenger train schedules in the nation were thus available for the first time in a handy pocket‐sized folder. (However, passenger sched ules df two Alaskan carriers— the Alaska Railroad and the White Pass and Yukon—have not yet been indluded in the folder.) Such nationwide schedules are common in Europe. Am trak's new folder also has a convenient chart to show all connections made by the 34 ar riving and departing trains at Chicago, still the nation's rail hub. The corporation announced complimentary taxi service for Passengers and hand luggage to cover all long‐haul connections affecting the, two stations still in use in Chicago—Union and Central. It said further that agree ment had been reached with both Greyhound and Trailways bus lines for the mutual honor ing of tickets between any two cities served both by Amtrak and either bus line. Amtrak's first schedule was a rarity in the New York area but this time the corporation states that over a half‐million copies of the 32‐page folder complete with nationwide map will be distributed tb the public in terminals and at travel of fices. Amtrak's president, Roger Lewis, said the new timetable included the folowing service improvements and extensions approved since May 1: ¶Daily trains between Chi cago and New York by way of Toledo, Cleveland, Buffalo and Albany. ¶Daily through service be tween New York and Boston by way of Worcester and Spring field, Mass. for the first time in 10 years (in addition to the regular service through Provi dence). ¶An experimental tri‐weekly train on the Northern Pacific route between Minneapolis and Spokane, Wash., including a Montana stop with a bus con nection to Yellowstone Na tional Park. ¶Through train service be tween Chicago and Norfolk, Va., by way of Cincinnati. ¶Through train service with no change of coaches between Chicago and Miami or St. Petersburg, by way of Indian apolis and I.ousiville. There are also improved con nections in several areas, for example the rescheduling of a Milwaukee‐Chicago train to connect with a Chicago‐Buffalo New York service. Running time has been improved in some cases and Chicago‐Detroit serv ice has been revised to provide morning and afternoon depar tures from both cities.

1085-> ENGLISH'S OUSTER IS URGED IN MEMO
The ouster of Dr. Joseph T. English as chief of the city's municipal hospital system has been requested in a confidential memorandum distributed this week to the directors of the Health and Hospitals Corporation. The memo, from Milton F. Kirchman to his 15 colleagues on the corporation's board of directors, was the latest in a series of developments within the system indicating growing dissatisfaction with Dr. English's leadership. At least three other directors have said they would vote to remove Dr. English, and others Mire voiced agreement with specific complaints in the Kirchman memo. The memo by Mr. Kirchman, an architect who heads the board's committee on capital construction, contends first that Dr. English has not worked hard enough for the erection of new hospitals and neighborhood family‐care centers. It then moves on to charge Dr. English with the following: ¶Failute to establish adequate programs for treating alcoholics and drug addicts. ¶Insufficient efforts to recruit enough nurses for the 18 municipal hospitals. ¶Failure, despite a unanimous vote by the hospital board, to institute screening programs for lead poisoning and sickle‐cell anemia in the city hospitals, and to reduce patients' waiting time in emergency rooms and outpatient clinics. Continuing, the Kirchman memo on Dr. English says: “The problem of our chief executive officer is of another kind. Here the problem is one of competence and responsibility.” The memo says: “The president is not responsive to the board; he modifies policy without advising the board; he develops budgets in camera despite repeated requests that he engage the board in the process.” “I suggest that our president resign,” Mr. Kirchman wrote, “but that his resignation not be made effective until the board chooses his successor.” Dr. English, asked for comment on the Kirchman memo, said: “This is too important to get personal about. My only comment would be that his memo contains a great number of inaccuracies. “Mr. Kirchman misunderstands some of the decisions we have made and some of the programs we have been trying to put across.” Asked to explain why Mr. Kirchman might be failing to understand, Dr. English replied: “A rather extraordinary effort has been made to keep him informed.” Dr. Edmund O. Rothschild of the Sloan‐Kettering Cancer Center and New York Hospital, who is a director, said he agreed Dr. English should leave, but added: “I'm not sure about waiting for a successor.” Two other directors have consistently sided with Mr. Kirchman and Dr. Rothschild in opposition to Dr. English. They are William Michelson, president of the Department Store Workers union, and Dr. Vernal G. Cave, director of the Bureau of Venereal Disease Control in the City Health Department. Other directors occasionally join the dissident faction, including Charles J. Bensley, a former member of the city's Board of Education. Speaking of the Kirchman memo, Mr. Bensley made it clear yesterday, however, that he would “not accept that as a totally accurate statement.” Mr. Bensley especially challenged the charge that Dr. English had failed to consult the board.

1089-> LONDON TO ADMIT FOREIGN BROKERS
LONDON, March 23 —Bro kers from the United States and other countries are to be admitted as members of the London Stock Exchange for the first time. The Stock Exchange Coun cil, the governing body, de cided yesterday to remove na tionality requirements that re strict membership to native, Britons or persons who have had British nationality at least five years. It costs $4,800 to become a, member of the London Stock Exchange. In 1969, 2,776 brok ers and 490 jobbers were listed as members, along with 228 member firms. Discussions on the admission of foreigners had been going on since the publication last year of a Monopolies Commis sion report that criticized re strictive practices in the pro fessions. The change will bring, the stock exchange into line with Lloyd's, the London insur ance association. A council statement said: “The introduction of a three‐ year training period and the fact that from August, 1971, all new members will have to have passed the Stock Ex change examination if they in tend to act as brokers, has tended to lessen the need for nationality restriction.” Other reasons cited were the increasingly international na ture of business and Britain's projected entry into the Euro pean Economic Community. The Stock Exchange's ban on advertising is also to be relaxed. Member firms in the future will be permitted to ad vertise in “newspapers, periodi cals and annual book of refer ence,” but advertising copy will be screened by the coun cil. Despite the ban, member firms have been able to adver tise in overseas publications. Many advertise in foreign peri odicals that are widely circu lated in Britain.

1090-> About Pro Hockey
With consecutive road vic tories over the weekend, the Rangers continued a surge that has lasted more than a month—and hasn't got them any closer to first place in the National Hockey League's East Division. In their last 22 contests, the New Yorkers have lost only twice. They began the stretch one point be hind the over bearing Boston Bruins. They are one point behind them today. Of course, the rest of the division has fallen far bhind. The others won't get much closer than they are now, unless the Rangers or Bostonians nosedive. The Rangers, who can move into first tomorrow if they defeat the Canucks at Vancouver, have 37 games remaining 19 at home. Twenty of their final contests will be against expansion clubs. What happened on Satur day and Sunday were exam ples of the team's opportun ism, coupled with the best defense and goaltending in the N.H.L. Rod Seiling scored late in the contest on Satur day at Minnesota for a 1‐0 victory. Gilles Villemure, whose goals‐against average is the best at 1.64, turned in his third shutout. The following night, Dave Balon scored twice as the Rangers got all their goals in the final period for a 4‐2 de cision at St. Louis with Ed Giacomin in the nets. Balon, overshadowed by half a dozen of his own teammates, let alone such figures as Bobby Hull and Frank Ma hovlich, is nevertheless on his way to posting the best scoring percentage since the league began keping such records in 1964. In the first half of the season, Balon con nected at a 27.7 per cent clip —23 goals in 83 shots. The Chicago Black Hawks, who have combined the sec ond‐best scoring mark with the second‐best defensive rec ord to run away with the West Division, suffered a strange defeat Sunday to Minnesota after toppling the Bruins on Saturday. The score was 2‐all when Referee John Ashley called a penalty against the Hawks’ Lou Angotti for tripping with 2 minutes 3 seconds remain ing. Stan Mikita became so angry at the decision that he pulled the net off its posts. Ashley then handed Mikita, a two‐minute penalty for delay of game. Thirty seconds later, the North Stars, with their two man advantage, got a goal from Barry Gibbs and won. Speaking of frustration, consider the Toronto Maple Leafs. In their last 15 games, they have picked up 27 of a possible 30 points—and gained only a point on the Rangers and Bruins. But they have moved solidly into fourth place, and apparently will make the playoffs. If their de fense, so unsure at the begin ning of the campaign, con tinues to keep the opposition's scores down, they can easily displace the Montreal Cana diens for third. In the Leafs’ 5‐2 victory over Pittsburgh on Saturday, Brian Spencer got three goals. He is the rookie whose father was re cently shot to death by a po liceman after the elder Spencer menaced a television station with a gun because he couldn't see enough of his son's on TV. A cause celebre in Montreal erupted yesterday with the disclosure that the Philadel phia Flyers have been in structed by their coach that only English may be spoken during a game. Coach Vic Stasiuk admitted, after his team's victory over Montreal on Sunday, that he had told five players on his squad not to communicate with each other in French on the ice. “A couple of the guys were shouting to each other in French,” he explained, “and warning each other about the other team. But one of the French players didn't warn an English player—and it re sulted in a goal.”

TROY N. Y., Jan. 3 (AP)— Wisconsin rebounded from yes terday's defeat by Western On tario and downed Northeastern, 14.3, today in the second round of the Rensselaen college hockey tournament. Rensselaer posted a bruis ing 5.2 victory over Western Ontario in the round‐robin event. The Badgers scored eight times in the first period and forced Northeastern to play virtually the entire game at its own end of the ice. Gary Winchester scored four goals, and eight other Wiscon sin players were also able to tally. The Badgers alternated two goalies and they were called on for only 11 saves to 64 for Northeastern's pair of netmindeas.

1094-> To a Texan's taste
There are certain dishes that haunt the mind—deliciously. And one of them is roast kid. Several years ago, we dined at the ranch of the Dudley Doughertys in Beeville, Tex. The Dougherty kitchen, was presided over by Rosa de in Garza, who turned talented Mexican hand to preparing roasted baby goat with a well‐seasoned northof‐the‐border sauce flavored with tomatoes and cumin seeds. ROASTED KID ½ baby goat including leg, shoulder and breast (see note), cut into serving pieces Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 5 cups Texas salsa (see recipe). 1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. 2. Sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper and put the pieces in a large roasting pan. Do not add any fat or liquid. Cover and bake two hours, stirring the pieces occasionally. 3. Sprinkle the meat with the oregano and bake, uncovered, 20 minutes. Add the salsa and continue baking and basting, uncovered, 20 to 30 minutes longer. Yield: Twelve servings. Note: Goat is usually available at Economy Meat Market, 995 Westchester Avenue, in the Bronx, and at Mara's West Indies Market, 718 Nostrand Avenue, in Brooklyn. Baby goat is usually sold whole, but these markets will cut it up upon request. TEXAS SALSA ⅓ cup vegetable shortening 2 cups coarsely chopped onion 1½ cups coarsely chopped green pepper 1 teaspoon cumin seeds (not roasted) 1 teaspoon crushed peppercorns 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 one‐pound cans Italian peeled tomatoes Salt and freshly ground pepper. 1.

1095-> Miss McCarthy Explains
[Jean‐Francois Revel, author of the recent “Neither Marx nor Jesus” (a great success in France, to be published here in the fall) conducted this interview with Miss McCarthy in her apartment near the Gare Montparnasse. “In seven years,” M. Revel said, “I had been in Mrs. West's flat [Miss McCarthy is married to James West] only at night, for parties and dinners. It looked strange to me in the daylight—smaller, quiet and proincial.” He used a tape recorder, which, he said, gave “a professional, ‘technotronic’ side to our conversation.” M. Revel also pointed out that although he has taken part in many interviews this was the first in which he was the interviewer.] In your new novel “Birds of America” what made you choose young boy, an American student, as the main character of the story? It just sprang like that out of my mind. I sat down and started typing out notes to myself about a new novel, and the notes begin: “On Equality....” They ramble on about the question of equality and suddenly (I've got these notes still) there come the words, “The action should begin with a young man.” A student, in Rome, and so on. But the boy just sprang there. In reality he's based on several boys but especially on one I knew here who was going to the Sorbonne. He had a plant that he took for walks. The other thing about him that I never got into the book was that he was very anxious to procure a skull. He's been to an exhibition of engravings by Bresdin at the Bibliotheue Nationale, which made him want to learn to draw, and he decided to start by drawing a skull. He wanted us to tell him how to get one, but I don't think we ever succeeded. We could find skeletons but not skulls. So, anyway, the boy was just there in the middle of the subject. It is also a kind of philosophical novel. At the end, Immanuel Kant himself speaks to the young boy, Peter, and tells him, “Nature is dead.” Is that the philosophical meaning of the novel? Do you think yourself that nature is dead? I believe it. Moreover I agree with Kant, if I understand Kant. You remember that quotation at the end about the beautiful things in nature proving that man fits into the world, etc. If nature—in the beautiful form that we normally think of it: that is, the outdoors, plants, farms, forests—if all this were to disappear, which it's doing, there'd be nothing stable left to stand on, no ground for ethics. Then you'd really be in a Dostoevskian position: why shouldn't I kill an old pawnbroker—because there's no longer a point of reference or a court of appeals. Nature for centuries has been the court of appeals. It will decide one way or another. Not always justly; but nevertheless (especially in our Anglo‐Saxon tradition—it's very strong in Shakespeare), the appeal is always to this court, to Nature's cort. And if this is gone, we're lost. And I think we're lost, I'm not an optimist. What do you think about the reaction againstthe ruination of na—ture? Today people look more and more for natural products, natural life, don't they? I really believe that Gresham's Law is operative in these things. don't think there's a natural selective process in masses of people that causes them to choose the better product. Well, I'll take the example of a turkey. I just bought a turkey at the U.S. Commissary. It was frozen turkey. I don't like frozen food, anyway; but normally American frozen turkeys are better than French fresh turkeys. But I read all this literature on the outside of the turkey, and it explained that this turkey had been “deep basted” with vegetable oil. The corpse had been injected (the word “basted” of course is hilarious in the context) with vegetable oil. Now Fm sure that next year or two years from now you won't be able to buy a turkey that this hasn't happened to. And the reason is not that it tastes better—I thought it was rather poor actually—but that you don't have to baste it in the oven. So people would rather have an inferior turkey and not have to work. To take your turkey as a symbol for the biosphere, your conclusion would be that the destruction of nature is inevitable? I think that's going to happen and I think that in general bad products drive out good. Nevertheless, your novel is about culture at least as much as about nature. There are not so many birds in it, except at the beginning. Peter seems preoccupied by social, political and literary or artistic matters, isn't he? Of course, one simple reason is that he's living in the city. There's nature in the beginning; but, after that, once he's living in the city, he isn't much in contact with Mother Nature. What in essence Peter is trying to do is lead a natural life and to try to find some natural life of the mind that would be common to every body. It would be like an environment that everybody could live in. But isn't the novel essentially about education? About how to become an adult in our time? Peter belongs to an intellectual family. He studies first in America and then in Paris and Rome. Why? I think I've forgotten. Well, I tell you, what takes place in the main body of the book is the equality theme. Peter keeps drawing up plans to send to General de Gaulle or Kosygin or whoever. He's bitten by the desire to solve the world's problems. But always, underneath this, is the desire to create balance and equality. That is, the plan for making sewer workers the best paid class in society. Which is very rational—it may not be practical but it's the product of rationality or over‐rationality. For instance, Peter is struck by all those headless statues, decapitated during the French Revolution, hence his reflections in his letter to his mother, where he says the French Revolution didn't go far enough—that we should chop off the head of language too. Of course, he's right, you know; and at the same time it's impossible. Unless maybe they do it in China. It's the only place in the world where they seem to be trying to create a biological mutation. By the changing of the Chinese language and the destruction of almost all the Buddhist temples and shrines. They'd like to destroy their artistic heritage in the interest of starting over. The clean slate. Well, anyway, Peter's story takes place before the cultural revolution; but the thought of such a purge crosses his mind. lie thinks, “I don't know whether I could stand it, but this is what should be done.” The very existence of culture seems to him an obstacle to equality? Or does it? Yes. At the same time, being intelligent, he sees all the obstacles to any scheme he puts forward. Like when he gets wound up in the question of tipping, seeing all sides. The categorical imperative, as he says, doesn't seem to work very well in that situation. Of course, but he still behaves like a born aristocrat. He can't stand ordinary people. I wouldn't say aristocrat. Rather he's a misanthrope. At home, though, he wouldn't be against ordinary people, the people who work in the Portuguese grocery store or the filling station, or the kids who play baseball. And he won't join the beach club. Ordinary people in their natural setting he doesn't object to. He liked grade‐school teachers when he was a kid much better than fancy masters in private schools. But isn't that super‐aristocratic behavior? You know, when one loves peasants and fishermen but cannot stand middle‐class people? Since we are living in an age where almost everyone is middle‐class, isn't that a kind of snobbishness? Take, for example, the visit Peter pays to the Sistine Chapel: he is almost sick because of the many American tourists there. These tourists are, after all, ordinary people; they are the people. Yes, but my point is that anybody, a grocery‐storekeeper, who had any eyes—that is, who had any real reason to be in the Sistine Chapel —would be just as annoyed as Peter by all that mob. The real problem hits him In the Sistine Chapel. Everything breaks down for him, his principles abandon him there. That is the whole point of the Sistine experience. He finally comes out and says, “There ought to be an entrance exam, it's the only way.” At that point, he's become reckless and maddened, he expresses his true feeling, and, being Peter, he reasons about it at the same time. But that has been a most conclusive challenge to his principles. It back to what he tells his mother in the letter, where he says that art and equality don't mix, that “the world will have to get rid of the people like you, Mother.” In the Sistine Chapel they try to mix. It's the opposite of the previous chapter, where he's happy, having fallen in love with the works of Borrornini, the 17th‐century architect that nobody else cares about seeing. Borromini of course is nature. I mean that Borrontini's world is a kind of fantastic forest. So that Peter has solitude, nature, art, contemplation there — everything he likes. All through this boy there has to be (I don't know why) this paradox of lover‐of‐solitude and misanthrope who is passionately concerned about equality. This happens to be a regular human type, of course —the misanthrope‐philosopher, but I didn't conceive it that way. So the philosophical lesson would be that nature is dead and that culture must die, for the sake of equality? But I didn't write the book to make a conclusion like that. Furthermore, the thing he says in his letter—which perhaps is really what's at the bottom of the book—ris this feeling about the idea of equality once having been entertained, nobody can get rid of it. This I have thought for years—that once the egalitarian notion was discovered, say some time in the 18th century, there's been a continual flight from it. Eventually we're going to have migration into space to escape equality. At the same time any person with a child's fairmindedness cannot help thinking that equality's a good idea. If we lose this fairmindedness of children, then we become monsters. In the Middle Ages you weren't a monster if you took inequality for granted but Why did you maize Peter an epitome of Western civilization? His mother is American and a first‐class musician, his father is an Italian Jew and a scholar, his stepfather a German physicist, the third husband of his mother is an internationally known art historian. I don't know why. I know made Hans a scientist to make an opposition between Peter and science. Maybe some sort of melting‐pot idea—I think it's really that. And America, after all, was supposed to be the land of opportunity and, well, the melting pot. To my mind one of the most lively parts of the book is Peter's French experience. An obvious failure. Is Peter's a representative case of young Americans abroad, as it is now, according to you? I'm really trying to be faithful to the experience of these kids over here‐98 per cent of them feel that—and they're so lonely. It's not Europe, it's France. I met a young Dane the other day who told me he'd lived here as a student and he said, “Exceptionally, I got something out of it; but the loneliness was so terrible.” They all say that. This business of going to the same cafe for six months and even the waiter won't, speak to you. Henry James had exactly the same experience. When he left Paris, he wrote a letter to his brother William James and said, “It would be ignoble to stay in Paris just for the restaurants.” But I think it's gotten worse. remember, tight after the war, in the 40's, when I was teaching, I had students who later came abroad on those Fulbrights and, though they were often very poor, they had a much better time and they enit in those Are there formal problems for you, a problem of the form of the modern novel? I think about them in connection with other writers, that is if I'm doing a criticism or a review. But when I'm writing a novel I don't look at it as some event in the history of the novel. The only formal problem I think about when I write is the formal problem of a sentence or a paragraph. I can't write any differently from the way I write. Do you feel any esthetic pressure on you of the new theories of the novel, or of the well established theories of the new novel? I do believe in a sort of “Tel Quel” doctrine, that you must listen to the language, that language tells you what you want to say. If some word is sticking out of a sentence, say, and it looks ugly, it is telling you what you don't want to say. Language is continually giving you messages, because language is a repository of everything on the verbal level that's been experienced by human beings. What you magnanimously call the “Tel Quel” doctrine is that language has no content, no meaning, the content of language is language itself. Do you agree? That I don't believe. Nevertheless it's obviously not question of just sitting down and copying something that's out there with the best means in your possession. At least half of it is going to be coming from something that is happening in language, including your own. There is no plot in your novel. But yet there are normal sequences which are close to traditional realistic writing. Isn't that so? Well, actually I think the form of “Birds of America” is rather strange. Because it isn't a realistic novel. Anybody who thought that was a realistic novel would be crazy. Still the oddity is only conveyed by tone—only by tone and not by the exterior formal devices. That's true. “Birds of America” is no more a realistic novel than is “Lolita,” for instance. But there are in it situations and characters, and you always indicate who is talking to whom. I suppose we all do it less than we used to because of the modern novel, even the people who write traditionally. We indicate who is talking much less than we did, simply by osmosis from the avant‐garde novel. The reader also has gotten used to having to work a little harder to identify speakers. In Nathalie Sarraute's novels, it's always clear really who is speaking; but you have to work for it and you sometimes have to do a repeat to be sure. remember when I first started to read “Ulysses.” I got up to, I think it was page 56‐1 couldn't get any further. And I tried again and it was always page 56. Then suddenly one year sat down and read the whole thing, and it was no longer difficult, and this was because so much Joyce had gotten in the atmosphere that Joyce himself became Do you think Joyce is really transparent now for the average reader, the public who is not professionally or passionately devoted to literature? I have a marvelous idea. People do not any longer expect to understand. It's really a very frightening development. They pick up some book and they really think it's all going to be normally unintelligible. This expectation leads to a loss of ability to understand, so when people come to something that is understandable they no longer get it and make the most incredible misreadings. This reading‐impairment is a product of In nouvelle litterature. Have you given any thought to what it is in people that makes them want a story? Because this is a very deep thing—obviously—and I don't think anybody has ever posed the question, that I know of anyway. I've posed it to myself but not very seriously. It would be a rather interesting subject for speculation and might mean could the You have been here, living in France, for almost 10 years. Has this had any impact on your writing, or what kind of impact could it have in the future? I think eventually I would lose my subject matter. Of course, this book took a long time to write. I started it way back in 64. Then I had those two Vietnam trips in between. Anyway, aside from that, don't think the international theme the confrontation of cultures—exists any more. Not because of formal developments. It no longer has any bearing: maybe air travel killed it. In my case, living in Paris and writing more or less in the realistic tradition, I couldn't do a novel about French people, because they'd have to talk French. I couldn't even write about English people. I'm incapable of writing at length about anybody except an American, so it's not only a question of being out of touch with the native speech but of being out of touch with the native subject matter. Joyce could write about Dublin while he was in exile because he was not interested in the present. Bloomsday, June 16, 1904, was all the more real to him because of the distance in geography as well as time. But if you're not that type of writer, by staying abroad, you eventually lose your subject matter. Certainly in my case the subject is social—is always Do you plan to go back? I don't think people's movements should be dictated by artistic needs. It would be horrible, evil, for one to make one's artistic needs the, motor of one's life. George Orwell was against it too, on sort of puritan grounds. Maybe I'm puritan too, I don't know. Of course it's true, about the egotism of writers—this monstrous egotism that we seem to have. Bellow is a most ghastly example of it. I don't think that wives and children and dwellings ought to be sacrificed to the needs of the artist, though there are certainly moods when I feel it. But on the whole I believe in a certain amount of submission to fate and also to chance. All that, too, is part of the natural and the vitality of the natural. Some subject has to propose itself to me—not me proposing myself to the subject. In writing, there has to be some element of the Tolstoyan “I cannot be silent.” That's more true, of course, of political polemics; but you don't sit down and decide to write a polemic. You reach the point of saying to yourself: cannot be silent any longer, Somebody wrote rather wittily about a woman poet in America that her only relation to poetry was the desire to write poems. I am rather against the autocratic will. If I moved home to America to pursue my subject matter, the subject would run away from me, I'm sure, as a punishment. Do you always write your novels slowly? This one was begun in 1964; and “The Group,” which was published in 1963, was begun in 1952. Not always, just those two. “The Group” became a terrible problem—partly a moral problem—not about sex of course. But I began to feel as though I was persecuting those girls and just hammering away at them and knocking their poor heads together and that I ought to stop that, this just could not go on, and so I put it away for several years. I didn't work on it at all and wrote another novel instead and then I went back and reread it and thought, this isn't so bad, I had been exaggerating. This happened repeatedly during those 11 years, and I did several books in between. Whereas, with this one, Vietnam got in the way. That is, I felt that could not go on writing about a boy of that age and not do something myself about Vietnam; that the whole book would have been some sort of trahison if I had just sat on my bottom. I wrote those two books, accomplishing nothing, doing absolutely no good. When Johnson fell out of office, we had one joyous moment of feeling that we had all accomplished something. In any case, after those trips, I felt I was Do you really think that the American writers who wrote about Vietnam didn't accomplish anything? Well, it's true. I'm so discouraged. I really thought when Nixon first came in that he wanted to get us out of the war, for whatever motives, think maybe he did; but the office doesn't want to get the President out of the war, which means that I think this war was “not an accident,” as Trotsky was fond of saying. It must come out of something very deep that we had not noticed in American life, because it took us all by surprise—this slow involvement in Vietnam, and it took us by surprise about America. A European could say we should have known before, but we were sort of like Peter's mother in imagining that there was this ideal American republic, with some shortcomings. find the situation extremely alarming now and, I don't know, I see no prospect of getting out of there; and, after all, the war is expanding.

1096-> Inventory Boom Expected To Sustain’71 Steel Gains
PITTSBURGH, San. 3—Steel producers were double checking their 1971 forecasts last week. There were a few downward revisions, but orders for both domestic and foreign steel sug gested the inventory boom will be about as big as expected. A typical projection called for inventory building to lift domestic shipments to around 65 million tons in the seven months prior to the Aug. 1 deadline for a steel strike. In ventory cutting was seen drop ping shipments to 31 million tons in the final five months. Shipments of 96 million tons for the full year would compare with 91 million tons in 1970. Steel imports were expected to rise from 13 million tons in 1970 to 16 million tons in 1971. Predictions of a modest import rise were not altered last week after word that foreign ship ments exceeded 1.7 million tons in ‘November. That was the highest import total since May of 1969. Likewise, there were few changes in domestic forecasts despite a lag in bookings for the first quarter. A mill an alyst predicted that last‐minute orders would increase ship ments in both January and Feb ruary. He said demand picked up momentum in the normally slow holiday week. Iron Age magazine pointed out that the order picture could be deceptive. Large users have outlined inventory programs to the mills, Iron Age said. Ton nage is reserved for these users, the magazine said, even though orders may not have been placed yet. A sales executive said this was true. One of the largest auto companies has provided detailed instructions on the handling of inventory steel, he said. These instructions cover both timing and the quantities for individual plants, he added. Mill officials pointed out that there is not enough steel ca pacity to take care of every one's inventory requirement after March.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 3—Leg islation urgently desired by the Export‐Import Bank to main tain its export credit financing failed to pass the House in the last‐minute adjournment rush, and there is some danger that the bank may have to curtail its burgeoning operations. However, officials are hope ful that before funds run out early this year, one of several possible solutions to the prob lem will be found. The legislation would have removed the bank's net outlays each year—the excess of its loan disbursements over its re ceipts from past loans—from the Federal budget. Backed by Administration The bill was supported by the Administration, originally some what reluctantly, but was op posed by the Federal Reserve Board. The House considered the bill under a procedure suspend ing normal rules and requiring a two‐thirds vote. The majority of 161 to 102 was not sufficient for passage. Opponents charged that there had been no hearings and the bill was just a device to avoid ordinary budgetary control. The banking committee unani mously supported the bill as urgently needed to maintain United States exports and to help the balance of interna tional payments. Chairman Wright Patman, Democrat of Texas, told the House that “if the Export Import Bank has to continue to operate as it now does, there is no question that the poten tial of our exports will be ad fected.” Possibilities For Rescue Officials of the bank said after the vote that under the present budgetary ceiling, im posed by the Budget Bureau, of $190‐million net loan dis bursements, the bank could be forced to stop operations by March. But they raised several possibilities for rescue: ¶Passage of the necessary legislation to end budget con trol early in the new session of Congress. ¶A decision by the Budget Bureau to raise the present ceiling. ¶“Selective” curtailment of lending programs, pinpointing those, such as the program of purchasing export finance paper from banks, that result in quick disbursements. ¶;Renewed effort to sell “cer tificates of beneficial interest” in the banks loans—a relatively unattractive type of paper in the market. These sales count as offsets against disburse ments and effectively raise the budgetary ceiling. The opposition to the bill by the Federal Reserve Board was expressed in a letter by Arthur F. Burns, chairman, to Senator John J. Sparkman, Democrat of Alabama, chairman of the Sen ate Banking Committee. Despite this opposition, the Senate passed the bill earlier ‘this month with little debate.

1098-> HICKEL LISTS CAUSES OF BREAK WITH NIXON
WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 (AP) —Walter J. Hickel, former Sec retary of the Interior, says that the antiwar march on Washing ton, the military incursion into Cambodia, Vice President Ag new's criticism of the nation's news media and the fatal shooting of four students on the Kent State University cam pus led to his break with the Nixon Administration. In the book entitled “Who Owns America?” published by Prentice‐Hall, Mr. Rickel says President Nixon watched foot ball on television during the November, 1969, antiwar march on Washington. The apparent “lack of con cern … bothered me greatly,” Mr. nickel said. This was followed by a series of Agnew speeches that, in Mr. nickel's view, abandoned the national reconciliation theme on which Mr. Nixon and Mr. Agnew campaigned. Recalling Mr. Nixon's an nouncement on April 30, 1970, of the military incursion into Cambodia, Mr. Hickel said: “I was screaming inside.” Then followed the Kent State shootings and an angry, mass march on Washington.

1099-> Federal Food Program Is Called a ‘National Disgrace’
WASHINGTON, Sept. 15—A former hunger consultant to the Nixon Administration today sharply criticized the Federal program to feed the poor as “national disgrace.” Robert B. Choate Jr., who stirred a debate last year when he charged that breakfast cereals were low in nutritional content, said that the Federal commodity food program inade quately served its four million recipients. Mr. Choate, who describes himself as a citizen‐lobbyist on hunger, said that the program, called the Direct Distribution Program, might best be termed “the indirect and irregular mal distribution of highly limited foods to the persistent poor.” His charges were made in a report prepared for the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, for which Mr. Choate serves as a con sultant. The committee opened hearings on the prograM today. In his report, Mr. Choate was critical of almost every aspect of the program, from the fund ing provided by Congress to the types of food provided to the poor. The committee also heard testimony from recipients, who complained of what they de scribed as the program's inade quacy and the bland, monoto nous, nutritionally deficient food. Mr. Choate declared in his report: “The nutritional delinquency of the direct food effort is galling when one stops to real ize that the Department of Agriculture in the mid‐sixties analyzed the nutrient consump tion of the public by economic groupings and proved to itself that the poor indeed did have shortages of nutrients in greater number of categories than did their better‐off coun terparts.” He said that the foods de livered to the poor provided between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of the nutrients needed. “How can a single aged man get his daily vitamin C for 30 days from one No. 3 can of fruit juice?” the hunger con Isultant asked. “How can a widow and child preserve one two‐pound can of peanut butter for three months? How can a couple with two children meet their daily vegetable needs for 30 days from four No. 303 cans of single vegetable?” Mr. Choate presented a chart listing 26 foods contained in month's supply. The chart showed the nutrient value of each food to be low. The foods on the chart included apple sauce, dry beans, butter, cheese, corn, grits, cornmeal, egg mix, canned chopped meat, dry split peas canned boned chicken, dried prunes, rice, corn syrup and wheat flour. One recipient, Marlow Rig gins, a disabled bricklayer who is on welfare and lives in a public housing project in Phoenix, Ariz., testified that his family gave away its monthly allotment of food; lie said he knew of others who dumped theirs in the trash. “People just simply cannot eat the same thing constantly that you people put out month after month,” Mr. Riggins told the three Republicans attend ing the session— Senators Charles H. Percy of Illinois, Marlow W. Cook of Kentucky and Henry Bellmon ‘of Okla homa. “Adding a couple more com modities does not take away the same canned meat that we have to eat over and over, the same rice over and over, the same beans over and over.” Food distribution to the poor was authorized by the Agricul tural Act of 1935. Thirty‐six states participate in the pro gram. Mr. Choate and his staff visited 14 of the states in con ducting their investigation. His report was highly critical of the Agriculture Department. He said that the department's contention that all but 10 of the country's 3,000 counties had food programs for the poor “is not only highly suspect, it's a lie.” Officials of the department had no comment on the charges’ They will testify before the I committee next Thursday.

1100-> Private Connecticut Colleges Report Drop in Enrollment
HARTFORD, Dec. 22—EnIrollment in independent colleges in Connecticut has fallen for the first time in more than 20 years, a report from the State Board of Education indicated today. The report states that fall enrollment in 26 independent institutions declined by 1.2 per cent from 51,861 to 51,251. At the same time, the report said, the enrollment in 21 public schools increased 2.3 per cent, to 130,859.

1101-> Oilers Drop Hughes
HOUSTON, Dec. 22 (AP) —Ed Hughes was let go as the Houston Oiler head coach today only hours after Bud Adams, the club's owner, said Hughes would return if he and the coach could agree on two issues. Adams said the only stipulations he made to Hughes were that Hughes release the trainer, Warren Arial, and rehire Johnny Gonzalez as equipment manager. Hughes refused to budge. Adams, at a news conference only hours before the announcement of Hughes's dismissal, had expressed optimism that he and Hughes, who was also present, could reach accord. Hughes has been embroiled in controversy most of the season, which ended in a disappointing won‐lost‐tied record of 4‐9‐1. He had been rumored on the way out although he was only on the first year of a five‐year contract. “I stipulated that he dismiss Arial as trainer because of the incident of Gonzalez's firing,” Adams said. “There's not a more loyal Oiler than Gonzalez. He started out cleaning shoes with us and he grew up with us. He'll be back on the job tomorrow. He just took a paid vacation. “Ed just felt that Arial was his man and he stood by him. am the most surprised person that he refused to make the decision to fire Arial.” Adams said he told Hughes when he left this afternoon's conference there would be no reconsideration and the search for a new coach would begin immediately. Asked about speculation that the Rice head coach, Bill Peterson, might be the next Oiler coach, Adams said: “I just heard Lou Saban had resigned at Denver and was going to Buffalo and that Bill Peterson would take the job at Denver. “If Bill hasn't accepted the job there, we'd be interested in talking to him.” Adams said he felt the players would understand the decision although many had talked to Adams personally expressing confidence in Hughes. “It's something we will have to discuss with them,” Adams said. “But they're all over 21 and I think they will understand.” One of Hughes's problems developed last month when John Breen, the general manager, and Adams discharged Ernie Zwahlen, the offensive line coach, without Hughes's approval. Last week, Hughes dropped the offensive backfield coach, Walt Schlinkman, without management's knowledge.

1102-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: The Price Commission review of rate increases for gas, electricity and telephone service approved by Federal and state regulatory agencies may be the new force needed to overhaul the obsolete utility rate‐making process. It is ironic that the plea by utilities for a higher profit rate is based on the fact that there is a need for capital improvements that they themselves neglected in the past. Instead of having a utility absorb the cost of improving service that it allowed to deteriorate through poor planning, the argument is that increased profit is required, presumably to attract the new capital needed to bring service back up to an acceptable level. It seems that a utility can profit by not investing adequately in capital improvements and then continue to profit—at a higher rate—because it suddenly needs capital for massive corrective action. Hearings before regulatory agencies are forums for testimony on accounting systems fiscal policies and profit standards. They are arenas reserved for experts on figures who in the course of time have developed the boundaries and rules of debate. Rarely is there discussion of incentives for efficiency economy improvement of service research and effective planning, and more rarely are these factori related to rates. The guidelines established by the Price Commission may force the regulatory agencies and the utilities to examine these procedures critically. There is more to rate setting than profit setting. There is need to review the utility's priorities as to whether capital improvements are concentrated in those areas that produce maximum profit or maximum service. There must be a review of the efforts made by the utility to institute economies in their operation. Efficiency and innovation should be the hallmarks of public utilities as they are of any other private enterprise. The Price Commission may not be able to introduce these considerations through its review but it may force the utilities to be more receptive to changes in rate‐setting procedures if the results are not in the nation's best interest. MILTON MUSICUS Chairman, N.Y.C. Interdepartmental. Committee on Public Utilities New York, Dec. 14, 1971

1103-> IN THE NATION
The Knapp Commission has been painting an unsavory picture of police corruption in New York City and of police and civil administrations that failed to act as vigorously and as promptly as they should have to clean up the mess. Undoubtedly as the detailed testimony shows, there is a lot of truth in this picture. Now Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy has charged that the court system “must accept the giant share of the blame for the continual rise in crime.” His and other statistics suggest that undoubtedly there is a lot of truth in this charge. Last fall at Attica, and before and since then at other prisons the public got glimpses of a correctional system that seems not so much to reform men as to make worse offenders of those sent to it by police and courts And every bit of evidence available confirms that there is a lot of truth in this impression. Mr. Murphy says the police are doing their job; they made 94,042 felony arrests in New York in 1970 nearly three times as many as in 1960; but by his figures only 522 of them went to trial. Harold A. Stevens a high‐ranking appellate justice said Mr. Murphy was trying to divert public attention from the Knapp Commission charges with this “diversionary tactic.” And Hugh R. Jones of the New York State Bar Association said the Commissioner had missed the main point that “public apathy” had allowed the “financial starvation” of courts correction system prosecution and defense agencies. The fact is that there is a lot of truth in all of that but not enough in any of it From top to bottom from the lowest‐ranking policeman on the beat through the highest‐ranking court to the toughest correctional facility the criminal justice system of America is in shameful disarray—overburdened underfinanced and understaffed; ineffective in determining guilt and deciding what to do about it; counterproductive in trying to turn men and women from alienation and crime to useful citizenship and little understood by the public it is supposed to protect. Mr. Murphy's statistics for instance may indict the courts, but what do they really mean? No one would pretend that the New York police force is 165 per cent better than it was in 1960 so if its officers made that many more arrests in 1970 than they did a decade before, one conclusion has to be that there is a lot more crime —that is a lot more observed need for felony arrests. To some extent most police forces have been given increased manpower and facilities to make such arrests in the last decade. But what of courts and corrections facilities? The amount of court reform such as that provided in President Nixon's crime bill for the District of Columbia has been minuscule; as for the medieval dungeons that pass for “correctional facilities” in most states they are if anything worse—since they are largely the same old institutions—than they were in 1960. It is no secret to anyone who lives in a major city that crime has increased and is getting worse no matter how many felony arrests the police make; thus, while Mr. Jones is unquestionably right that the criminal justice system is starved for funds it strains credulity that this results from “public apathy.” There is no mare volatile political issue in America today than “law and order.” The real trouble is public ignorance —the kind of ignorance that thinks club‐swinging cops on the beat prevent muggings and rapes that believes the death penalty reduces the likelihood of murder, that wiretapping and bugging increase neighborhood safety that more tear gas and Mace and riot guns and armored cars can bring tranquility that repressive laws and legal short‐cuts will reduce crime rather than further overburden our inadequate Courts and overcrowd our outmoded prisons. More efficient better‐trained and paid police with a far broader understanding of social and community problems; better‐staffed and organized courts with a vast increase in judges and prosecutors so that justice can be meted out swiftly and effectively; relief from the need to clog what courts we have with petty gambling sex and auto offenders; a corrections system that treats offenders—particularly first offenders—like men to be helped rather than Animals to be caged —all of these are vitally important if what Mr. Nixon likes to call the “peace forces” are to prevail in any way that means anything. But all of these together will not suffice to reduce the incidence of crime —they will at best cope with its increase—until some credible attack is mounted on the poverty unemployment and maldistribution of wealth and advantage as well as the racial animosities, that divide the nation into two nearly warring societies. That underlying truth is what the public seems least to understand and its camouflage in half‐truths evasions panaceas and tough talk represents the most signal failure of American political leadership.

1105-> The Midonick Meaning
The victory of Family Court Judge Millard L. Midonick in the rainy Democratic party primary for Manhattan Surrogate is a clear mandate for reform of this politics ridden court. At the same time it represents an impor tant psychological boost for the Reform Democrats their effort to take judicial designations out of machine politics. Judge Midonick, supported by the New Democratic Coalition and the Liberal party and endorsed by Mayor Lindsay, is pledged to consolidate the Surrogate's Court with the State Supreme Court, create an Office of Public Guardian, select guardians by impartial screening and reduce the administrative costs of estates. The predom inance of Democrats in Manhattan virtually assures his election in November. That should provide a strong spur for action by the State Legislature to authorize the reforms for which Mr. Midonick campaigned. Although the Regular Democratic candidate, Supreme Court Justice Frederick Backer, was defeated in the Surrogate primary, his fine general record on the bench should lead to his redesignation when the judicial con vention delegates meet this Saturday to nominate four State Supreme Court judges for the First Department. On the other vacant posts this judicial convention bears close watching to see whether the machine will again dictate the choices. Aided by an extremely low total vote, the Democratic organization's judicial slates drubbed the reformers, especially in the Bronx and Queens, with mixed results in Manhattan. The caliber of the candidates selected will be a test of clubhouse power in judicial payoffs and future party affairs. Assemblyman Frank G. Rossetti retained his East Harlem district leadership by a wide margin, but his position as Manhattan Democratic chieftain has been badly shaken by the Midonick primary victory. Mr. Rossetti will be challenged In forthcoming weeks by new and old reform forces seeking to rebuild the citypolitically and otherwise—and to provide more effective representation for the poor and minorities. But before he can be ousted the reformers themselves will have rally around a ‘strong challenger who can unite the party and represent the diverse elements in the city. This is an area in which that recent convert, Mayor Lind say, might begin to make his contribution to a more progressive alignment. The result could affect the Demo cratic party in state and national politics.

1106-> Owners to Run City School Buses Through Tuesday
School bus operators here agreed yesterday to continue service through Tuesday while they make a further attempt to obtain Federal approval of their new contracts with the Board of Education. Norman Redlich, first assist ant corporation counsel, said that the bus companies would submit their books to the In ternal Revenue Service for scrutiny, in an effort to sup port their statements that they would go bankrupt if they had to operate at last year's prices. On Tuesday night, the Presi dent's Cost of Living Council reaffirmed an earlier decision that the school bus contracts violated the current Federal wage‐price freeze. The Internal Revenue Service has been ad ministering the freeze. Mr. Redlich macle the an nouncement after a 22‐minute emergency meeting held at City Hall, attended by Mayor Lind say, Controller Abraham D Beame, City Council leaders and officials of the Board of Education and the bus com panies. The new contracts, provid ing for the daily transportation of 116,000 public and nonpub lic school pupils, would cost $33‐million a year. The amount is 40 per cent higher than last year's figure. Isaiah E. Robinson, the presi dent of the Board of Educa tion, was asked if he was optimistic that the matter would be resolved before Wednes day, when the latest extension of service runs out. “When bus companies are eager to open their books to the Federal Government, it would appear to me that they think they have a case,” he replied. Mr. Redlich reported that the council said it would consider another formal application by the bus operators for an ex emption from the freeze, based on financial information to be provided by the companies. He added that the new Federal ruling was expected Monday or Tuesday. The city's public schools will be closed on Monday and Tues day, because of Rosh ha Shanah, the Jewish New Year. School bus service, however, will be provided on those days to parochial and private school pupils who are normally trans ported. Other school developments yesterday included the follow ing: ¶Chancellor Harvey B. Scrib ner submitted a revised pro posed school construction pro gram for 1972–73, calling for an outlay of $786,320,000 and for some new concepts in meet ing school building needs. One proposed approach involved the construction of several small schools, of 400 to 600 pupils each, on small dispersed sites, rather than one large conven tional school on a central site. ¶The Board of Education, at its public meeting last night, postponed until Oct. 6 action on a proposal by Chancellor Scribner to establish new eligi bility requirements for acting superintendents. The plan would give the city's 31 community school boards great flexibility in making appointments in the decentralized districts. At last night's meeting the board heard a parade of speak ers debate the Chancellor's pro posal. Most of the 150 persons in the audience appeared to support the recommendation. ¶Public School 99 in the East Bronx remained closed for the third day by a parents’ pro test, even though their original objective — the recision of an order assigning 270 junior high school students to a facili ty there—had been achieved. A secondary objection, men tioned by some demonstrators, was to the poor physical condi tion of P.S. 99. There was no indication when the 800‐pupil school would reopen. Dr. Scribner's new capital budget proposal was based on consultation with local school officials. It will be the subject of a public hearing by the Board of Education on Sept. 27, starting at 9:30 A.M. The ses sion will be held at board head quarters, 110 Livingston Street, Brooklyn.

1107-> Bride Offers Her Gifts As a Reward in Murder
A young Bronx bride Mrs. Miriam Mitzner offered her wedding gifts yesterday as reward to anyone who would bring to justice the murderers of her shopkeeper father Izzy Pacht. “My father is dead, he is in the ground, but I don't want him to he a faceless statistic,” Mrs. Mitzner said. “I want these people to hang,” She and her family made the reward announcement to reporters whom they had invited to their cramped apartment not far from the shop at 492 Claremont Parkway where Mr. Pacht a survivor of Nazi concentration camps had proudly put up a sign reading, “I Pacht Clothing Store.” Mr. Pacht had bonrowed money to pay for a wedding reception for his only daughter on Dec. 11. He was working late a week after when two holdup men entered the store He struggled with one and fell mortally wounded with a 38caliber bullet in his chest. The Pacht family made a plea for better police protection as they offered the gifts valued at $3,000 to $4,000 for the arrest and conviction of the killers. Congressmen Present Similar appeals were made by Representatives Mario Biaggi and James H. Scheuer of the Bronx who also attended the meeting in the apartment. Their presence and the reward underscored the mounting desperation that many Bronx residents have been expressing over the rising crime in the borough. The police say that spreading drug addiction is largely to blame for the upsurge in violence in recent years. In the Bathgate Avenue precinct which includes the Pacht shop there were 19 cases of murder and manslaughter in the first 10 months of this year compared with eight in all of 1970. In the four‐precinct South Bronx area 6,705 robberies had been recorded through the end of September compared with 8,010 in all of last year. “There's not enough police around,” said Mr. Pacht's widow Jean. She wore no make‐up and no shoes in observance of Orthodox Jewish mourning tradition. “Gimbels and Macy's, they're protected so let them protect the little people too,” she said “Please let's have more safety —let them stop selling guns.” Fearing vengeance from the killers, Mrs. Pacht asked that the family address be withheld Her daughter who is 23 years old her son Harry who is 20, and her son‐in‐law Marvin Mitzner refused to be photographed except from behind. The son a student at Lehman College said: “This country is just a jungle Where are our leaders?” Unshaved also in accordance with Orthodox mourning practice he paced the tidy parlor and said: “Everybody has gun, but they told him, ‘No, don't get a gun.’ The two Representatives both Democrats proposed different measures to combat crime. Mr. Biaggi said: “The police are too remote from the businessman. The radio car is not the answer foot patrol must be brought back.” Mr. Scheuer urged that the authorities require and provide alarm devices that would enable small shopkeepers to alert the police during holdups. He said: “This is a classic case where the simplest kind of technology could have had the police there at the store in 30 seconds.” He Was a Tailor Too Besides selling clothes Mr. Pacht also was a tailor trade he had learned in his native Poland. He was born in a smal town outside of Warsaw 53 years ago. A small man — he was about 5‐feet‐6—Mr. Pacht survived internment at the hands of the Nazis. He and his wife came to the United States in 1949 after passing through a displaced‐persons camp in Berlin where their daughter was born. The Paclits became citizens and Mr. Pacht opened his clothing store eight years ago after operating a dry‐cleaning business. He took great pride in his children. His daughter a teacher studied at the Miles College of Education in Manhattan. Her husband, an engineer is studying law at night. The newlyweds learned of Mr. Pacht's death when they returned from a Caribbean honeymoon last weekend. He was killed Saturday while working in his shop after sundown. Mr. Pacht usually kept the store locked but the police said he let the two holdup men in after they showed a Islip of paper on which he had written the price of a pair of trousers several days before. Mr. Pacht had previously fought off more than one knife wielding holdup man But these two men were armed with revolvers and one the police said fired as Mr. Pacht grappled with him Then both gunmen fled.

1108-> Chess:Alphonse and Gaston Style Usually Low in Excitement
When two players from the same country meet in an international tournament, the result is often a quick, even perfunctory, draw. This is especially true of players from some of the countries of Eastern Europe—Russians and Yugoslays, particularly. When two Yugoslays meet in the international arena, a de cisive result is most unlikely. There are several reasons why many compatriots have such attitudes toward one another. The most important is also the least tangible: the feeling that it is somehow “bad form” to take a full point from a countryman. It is also convenient for a play er to be assured of an easy game once in a while—chess tournaments are gruelling af fairs, and one cannot, after all, play at top speed every day. Thus, the unspoken agreement is seen to have a practical side. Players from the Western countries, however, often tend to be neither so deco rous, nor so practical. In the recent international tourna ment at Amsterdam (won by a former world champion, Vassily Smyslov of the So viet Union, as previously re ported) there were six Dutch players who played a total of 15 games among themselves. Of these, 13 were played to a decision. This is an extraordinarily high percentage, and indi cates that something quite the reverse of the situation outlined above was in effect: the players seem to have torn into each other with a special ferocity that can per haps be explained only in personal terms. Whatever the cause, the results are far more exciting than the re sults of the Yugoslays’ non aggression pact. In one game, Timman against Donner, Black tried a wild, sacrificial attack that nearly succeeded, and left one with the feeling that it might have met a better fate. One possible improvement is 21 … PxP, with the, pos sible follow‐up of 22 N‐Q2 (22 BxN, R‐B3; 23 R‐N1, R‐R3; 24 R‐N2, PxP) R‐B3; 23 R‐KN1, R‐R3; 24 N‐B1, P‐K6; 25 R‐N3, N‐K5). The continuation Black actually chose also looked promising, but White finally warded off the attack and emerged with winning material and posi tional advantage. In the game between Hartoch and Scholl, White found a charming little com bination that netted him two pieces for a rook. The game was a textbook illustration of the old aphorism warning against playing knights to the edge of the board— “knight on the rim brings trim.” The warning is sound prin cipally because knights on the rim have restricted mo bility by comparison with knights in the center and also because, as in this in stance, they are subject to little tactical jokes.

1110-> SENATE APPROVES GATEWAY PROJECT
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6— The Senate today approved the establishment of the Gateway National Recreation Area, which would open up more than 26,000 acres at the en trance to New York harbor to an estimated total of 10 mil lion visitors a year, more peo ple than visited the nation's six national seashores last year. The measure now goes to the House, where the Interior Committee has held hearings on the Gateway project, but will not report out its version of a bill until after Congress reconvenes Sept. 8 from its summer recess. As approved by the Senate by voice vote and with no de bate or audible dissent, the Gateway National Recreation Area would consist of Jamai ca Bay and most of the Breezy Point section of Queens; Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn; Great Kills Park, S. I. and Sandy Hook, N. J. Senate approval of the bill, which is a modified version of a proposal sent to Congress by the Nixon Administration last May, represents a major ad vancement for the project. The recreation development was first advocated in May, 1969, by the then Secretary of the Interior, Walter J. Hickel, to establish Federal recreation areas in highly congested ur ban areas. A Senate Interior Commit tee report accompanying the bill declared that “nowhere in the country are there as val uable park resources as those parcels recommended for the Gateway National Recreation Area.” “This project,” it continued, “offers an opportunity for a great recreation area directly benefiting one‐tenth of the na tion's population. Many citizens there are without access to other high quality parks.” Before passing the bill, after considering it for less than two minutes, the Senate also ap proved an amendment by Sen ator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York, that would pro hibit further commercial devel opment within the Breezy Point Cooperative. The cooperative, a grouping of about 2,800 privately owned homes on the Rockaway pen insula, would not be included in the proposed recreation area, although the coopera tive's beachfront would be pur chased by the Federal Govern ment and made available for use by the public as part of the project. The sites to be included in the Gateway project would be taken over by the Interior De partment and preserved or de veloped for recreational pur poses similar to a national park or a national seashore, such as those on Fire Island or Cape Cod. The bill authorized total de velopment costs over a 20‐year period of $98,148,000, with land acquisition costs limited to $40‐million. Most of the land already is owned by the Feder al Government or New York City and would become part of the recreation area without cost, although the Interior De partment would buy a few sec tions of privately owned prop erty, such as the beachfront of the Breezy Point Cooperative. The Interior Committee's (chairman., Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington, a po tential Democratic Presidential candidate, helped push the bill through the Senate relatively quickly. As modified by the committee, the measure directs the Interior Department to de velop a water transportation system such as hydrofoils or hovercraft to improve accessi bility to the Gateway sites and to minimize the use of automo biles to reach the recreation area. In addition, the committee authorized a 12‐member advi sory commission to aid the In terior Department in planning development of the project. The committee noted that the beaches to be included in Gate way now are used by about 2 million people a year but that with “modest transportation development” more than 10 million visitors could be ex pected. Last year there were 9.1 million visitors to the na tion's six national seashore areas. With the addition of ferry services and the development of additional beaches, the com mittee said, “It is anticipated that as many as 50 million per sons will be able to reach the beaches and recreation areas of Gateway.” In a joint statement, Sena tor Javits and Senator James L. Buckley, Conservative Republican of New York, hailed passage of the bill by the Senate as “an historic step in the process of making avail able urban parks to serve our vital metropolitan centers. The future benefit to New York State and the nation from this project are inestimable.”

1111-> Music: In the Parks
The New York Philhar monic, flooded out in its attempt to open its summer season Tuesday night in Cen tral Park and drizzled upon throughout Wednesday night's only slightly more successful concert in Staten Island, finally broke out of the clouds on Thursday night. The Nethermead of Brook lyn's Prospect Park was flooded, but this time it was with music listeners, who were served up an excellent concert under the direction of István Kertész. The Hungarian‐born con ductor gave carefully poised readings of Weber's “Euryan the” Overture and Dvorak's Symphony No. 6 in D, and accompanied Lorin Hollander in Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor. The Proko fiev, an overblown and heavi ly padded piece, is crammed with opportunities for pian istic display, and Mr. Hol lander made much of them. However, his performance was also marked by a yearn ing lyricism that made more palatable the long stretches of keyboard fustian. When the audience is large and one is necessarily, far from the stage, the Philhar monic's sound system some times does not do excep tionally well, it should be mentioned. String tone can be scrawny, the timpani takes on a flat, harsh effect, and grand climaxes sound like a thousand cash regis ters simultaneously ringing up “No Sale.” Outdoors, acoustical problems are al ways great, but one has heard truer open‐air sound than Prospect Park listeners were given on this occasion.

1112-> Princeton Battle Site Stirs Dispute
PRINCETON, N. J., Jan. 24— The Institute for Advanced Study here, dedicated to the expansion of knowledge and the preservation of Western culture, is under attack for alleged insensitivity toward the significance of 12½ acres of ground in early American his tory. Denying the charge, the institute says that it yields to no one in its reverence of the American Revolution and, in particular, of the significant victory over the British scored in the Battle of Princeton here 194 years ago this month. The institute owns 800 acres of land in Princeton Township and its campus lies just south of the Borough of Princeton on Mercer Road. A tract of 150 wooded acres is maintained by the institute as a bird sanctu ary open to the public. Four years ago, the institute acquired a privately owned tract nearby. The 12½ acres, intended for faculty housing, lie between the state‐owned Battlefield Memorial Park and the property of the Quaker Meeting on Mercer Road, whose building stood at the time of the battle. The institute's announced in tention of erecting 10 one family houses for faculty mem bers on the newly acquired property has brought an outcry from the Princeton Battlefield Preservation Society. Minot C. Morgan, general manager of the Institute for Advanced Study, said in an interview that he was “aston ished” at the vigor of the opposition to the institute's plan and that he was “dis mayed” over “the many mis understandings” about what the institute actually planned for the tract. The preservation group de nounced the institute's plan as a “housing project” and is ask ing authorities in both Trenton and Washington to provide funds to “save this hallowed ground.” The committee charges that already “most of the site” of the battlefield on which Wash ington is credited with turning the tide of battle in favor of his army through his personal daring and leadership is “al ready under houses.” The clash of arms nearly 200 years ago ranged over hundreds of acres in the vicinity of Princeton and Stony Brook and it ended with a British rout as well as the capture by Wash ington of Nassau Hall at what is now Princeton University. The officially protected area remaining of the battlefield is now confined to the memorial park and a total of 39 acres along Mercer and Quaker Roads. The institute, through Mr. Morgan and his assistant, Carl Pope, takes the position that no documentation exists that would single out the 12‐acre tract as being more significant in the history of the battle than many other acres already built upon in the area. “Utility mains, gas, sewage and electricity, already run along the road in front of the tract. There is no ‘housing project’ contemplated. What we plan is substantial private hous es for our expanding faculty, which may grow by 10 persons over the next decade,” Mr. Pope said. Mr. Morgan explained that the institute had offered to di vide the tract and sell the rear wooded portion to the state to be attached to the Battlefield Park. The institute, he said, would accept a token payment of as little as a dollar for a state 99‐year lease of a 20‐acre tract that abuts the institute's campus to the south for use as a battlefield memorial. Mr. Morgan added that this proposal was “on the desk” of New Jersey's Commissioner of the Department of Environ mental Protection, Richard J. Sullivan. Meanwhile, the preservation society continues to sound its warnings through pamphlets, brochures and a letter‐writing campaign warning that “once lost our present opportunity can never be regained” to save this portion of a historic area. “To introduce houses, ga rages, cars, signs, roads and telephone poles in the middle of this historical area can only be destructive to a place which is unchanged since the 18th century,” the preservation group warns. The Institute for Advanced Study, headed by Carl Kaysen, its director since 1966, denied that it had any “expansionist” plans beyond a modest build ing program now in progress on its present campus where a permanent faculty of 27 live, read, study, discuss and think. The preservation society is soliciting contributions for its fight to retrieve the disputed tract for which the institute paid $100,000 in 1966 to the private owners. The preservation group hopes that with state and Fed eral matching funds along with its growing war chest the tract might be bought back from the institute. Whether the insti tute would sell was not dis closed by its officials today. Mr. Morgan said the institute was awaiting a reply to the proposal it had made to Mr. Sullivan. Two leaders of the society's fight to preserve the tract are Mrs. Mary Whitney, originally from Concord, Mass., who ad mits to some dichotomous feel ings since her husband is a member of the institute's fac ulty, and Mrs. Margen Penick. Mrs. Penick was born and reared in. Seattle and said she had never seen any physical memento of the American Rev olution or that period of history until she came to the East Coast. A hearing will be held on Feb. 1 by the zoning board of Princeton Township on vari ance requests submitted by the institute for a reduction of building parcels for single dwellings from two to one acre. The institute plans to build 10 residences on the 12 acres. It was explained that if the par cel was reduced by half, the in stitute would build the houses on six acres.

1113-> An Ombudsman at Columbus High School Is Helping Solve Crises in Classrooms
Eighteen ‐year ‐old Sharon had just come from an angry shouting match with her history teacher and she was upset. There was no doubt about that. Despite a peculiar smile the girl practically quivered with indignation and anxiety as she and a friend burst breathlessly into the office of 34‐year‐old Richard Herzig seeking help from him in solving her classroom problem. Mr. Herzig is a lean, almost hawk‐faced bachelor with moderately long hair and an even, judicious temperament. He is a former social‐studies teacher, canoe‐trip guide on Maine's treacherous Allagash River, and amateur race‐car driver. He now holds the title of coordinator of student affairs at Christopher Columbus High School in the Bronx. As such his job is that of ombudsman confessor, confidant, red‐tape cutter and part‐time father to many of Columbus’ 4,800 students. “It's good to have a friend,” reads a sign in his office. His role is a relatively new one in high schools in New York and other schools in the country, one that attempts to bridge a gap of mistrust and understanding between students and teachers that is often detected these days. Sharon told her story to Mr. Herzig in a tumbling rush of words. The teacher had called for quiet at the beginning of the class. Sharon hadn't heard her. The teacher had rebuked her, and Sharon had tried to explain One thing had led to another: Voices had risen, the situation had become ugly and suddenly Sharon had been given three official misconduct marks. Sharon's friend, Dorina, had jumped into the affair and now she too was on the teacher's bad side. Under careful questioning by Mr. Herzig both girls admitted that they had “lost their cool.” But they maintained that the teacher had lost hers too. “The teacher is always right, no matter what,” Dorina complained later. It is a common complaint among high‐school students. “What's dynamite about Mr. Herzig is this,” Dorina continued. “You know he isn't sure whether to believe you or not. But he won't tell you that. He'll sympathize with you, and then find out the other angle from the teacher. If you're wrong he'll tell you so. But he makes you feel good about it.” “The girls felt you had over‐reacted,” Mr. Herzig told the teacher the next day. “There may be some merit to that,” conceded the teacher. “I lost my temper.” She explained that she hadn't really planned to turn in the misconduct marks officially but acknowledged that “of course, she [Sharon] couldn't know that.” Mr. Herzig reported back to the girls and arranged for them to meet privately with the teacher to resolve the dispute. Rapport Absent It cannot be said that any great teacher‐student rapport was apparent during the meetings. As the teacher pointed out, it is all but impossible to get to know students well enough in a big conventionally organized high school. But the immediate misunderstanding evaporated and the misconduct marks against Sharon were dropped. Later the teacher said she thought that Mr. Herzig's intervention “brought about a solution more quickly than it would have come otherwise” and that it prevented a building‐up of resentment in the students. “I get at least one of these a week,” Mr. Herzig said. “This is what I spend a tremendous amount of time doing—smoothing things over between kids and teachers.” “Teachers can be very frightening people to kids, and the kids need support,” he explains. The office of studentaffairs coordinator was established in all of the city's high schools in October 1969 just before the first Vietnam Moratorium primarily as means of liaison between student activists and the school administration. No Formal Powers “Most principals were very, very hesitant to appoint such a guy at first,” explains Robert Folchi, the principal at Columbus. “If the guy becomes a hero to the students and gets a following, he can turn the school around. He becomes the boss.” “But when it's done the way it's done here it's very effective,” Mr. Folchi went on. “It's one of the things that has kept this school on an even keel.” Mr. Herzig who has been at Columbus as teacher and administrator for 14 years, is the school's first studentaffairs coordinator. He report's directly to the principal and has no disciplinary function. If he did, students would not talk freely to him. He has no formal power to enforce decisions on teachers. “They have to be persuaded,” Mr. Herzig said the other day. “Usually when a teacher can't he that's when he's completely wrong Then I have to go to the principal. But that's very rite.” Day after day students seek out Mr. Herzig's tiny cubicle on the first floor of the school at 925 Astor Avenue, not far from the Botanical Gardens in the northeast quadrant of the Bronx. Mr. Herzig estimates that he deals directly with about onequarter of the school's population during a school year. Many Come to Talk Many students like Sharon and Dorina come to the office with specific grievances. Others like ex‐drug addicts and students who have fallen into the habit of class‐cutting come just to talk in the hope that Mr. Herzig can help them sort out their problems. Others come because they have found no one else they authority with whom they can discuss things as athletes for example have in their coach. “Unless you're real smart and in Arista (the honor society) or are bad and meet the dean you never know anybody,” complained one student. Often Mr. Herzig is out of his office roaming the halls seeking out teachers and students to discuss problems or just trouble‐shooting in general. An F in Gym On one such foray while report cards were being prepared, he noticed that a senior honor student had grades of 90 or above in all subjects but one — health education, or “gym.” He was marked failing in that To fail gym as a senior is to fail to graduate. “This is absolutely ridiculous,” Mr. Herzig snorted after one look at the card and went to investigate. The boy had been failed because he had not presented a certificate of medical examination. After two days of investigation, Mr. Herzig and Mr. Folchi found out that the certificate was not required, and the principal sent a letter to the faculty saying that henceforth, its absence would not be grounds for failure. “That's O.K.,” said a gym teacher when Mr. Herzig informed him of the decision “We'll find something else We'd have passed him at the end of the term anyway. We're just trying to scare them.” “But why?” Mr. Herzig countered. ‘Hard‐Liners’ Opposition That attitude in some ways places Mr. Herzig in direct opposition to the self‐described disciplinary “hardliners” on the Columbus faculty, some of whom contend that he has undermined order and discipline. “Some teachers feel the kids can go to Herzig and he'll get them off,” said one such teacher. But students testify as Dorina suggested that Mr. Herzig does not take the students’ side automatically. In fact, he has sometimes been viewed as a “company man” by some students. “His job is a thankless one,” said a teacher who is basically sympathetic to Mr. Herzig. “If he's doing it well it's hard to see the results and give him credit. But it's very easy to knock him.” “Being a fence‐sitter is not easy,” said another less sympathetic teacher. “He can't please everyone.” “If I didn't like this,” Mr. Herzig mused, “I couldn't do it. it's the kind of a job that can destroy you if you let yourself get tied into knots.”

1114-> LONG SCORES PLAN FOR INCOME LEVEL
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6—Sen ator Russell B. Long charged tonight that the family‐assist ance plan backed by the Nixon Administration and approved by the House “does not consti tute welfare reform at all.” The Louisiana Democrat, who is chairman of the Senate Fi nance Committee, has been generally critical of various forms of the welfare bill for the last year, but today he specifically rejected its under lying concept, the guaranteed income level for poor families. Using the benefit figure for a family of four in the legisla tion, Senator Long charged that the Administration was insist ing on “according everyone the opportunity to loaf and guar anteeing them an income of $2,400 a year while they do it.” The bitter attack from the Senate floor by the committee chairman drastically reduced the prospects that the far reaching welfare measure, al ready approved by the House, would get to the Senate floor before the end of the year.

1115-> Kheel Asks Joint Union Talks on City Pay
Theodore W. Kheel, the labor mediator, said yesterday that the four police and fire unions had “a moral obligation” to join together in their present contract negotiations with the city to avoid a repetition of last week's strike by policemen. Mr. Kheel said this obliga tion existed regardless of the outcome of the suit under way in State Supreme Court in which members of the Patrol men's Benevolent Association are seeking retroactive raises of $100 a month under their old contract to restore the pre vious relationship of their pay to the pay of sergeants. The four unions are the Pa trolmen's Benevolent Associa tion, the Sergeants Benevolent Association, the Uniformed Fire fighters Association and the Uniformed Fire Officers Asso ciation. Although the city has been negotiating separately with each union, the wage prob lems are related because of sal lary ratios that exist between the groups. “Unless the unions partici pate jointly in resolving the questions of pay parity and of the total wage packages they are seeking, the city will be in constant turmoil,” Mr. Kheel said. It was Mr, Kheel who made an arbitration award in 1969 that granted the police ser geants a raise to bring their pay to a level with the pay of fire lieutenants. This award led the Patrol men's Benevolent Association to demand a comparable raise, which they said was contract ually due them to maintain their pay ratio with the ser geants. The patrolmen contend that the city had agreed to pay them $3 for every $3.50 it pays sergeants. The city has insisted that it never made a firm contractual agreement to maintain the pa trolmen's parity. Trial on this issue started last Wednesday and is to be continued today before Justice Irving H. Saypol. Mr. Kheel expressed the opinion that the patrolmen had a legal claim to higher wages lunder their old contract. “Whether it was wise of the city or not to make such an agreement is something else,” he said. “But it is a claim that the policemen have.” “What is important now is the parity situation for the future,” he continued. “This cannot be resolved in negotia tions of each union separately. We have to take into consid eration that the city is caught in the middle of these ‘me‐too’ demands of the unions. If the unions don't resolve this in joint negotiations, the situation will be impossible to control.” The policemen and the mem bers of the Uniformed Firefight ers Association have the same base pay of $10,950 a year. Should the policemen get the retroactive pay rise of $2,700 they claim is due them, the fire men have indicated they will seek the same. This would set off a spiral in which the mem bers of the Uniformed Fire Officers would want their pay raised, too, and the sergeants also. Mr. Kheel expressed his opin ions on the Columbia Broad casting System's “Public Hear ing” television program, which was prerecorded, and in an in terview by telephone from the Virgin Islands afterward. The present contracts be tween the city and the firemen. patrolmen, fire officers and Sergeants Benevolent Associa tion expired Dec. 31. Negotia tions have also been going between the city and the Uni formed Sanitationmen's Associ ation, whose contract also ex pired on that date. The city made wage offers to the firemen and sanitation men's unions, which were re jected. Wage offers to the patrolmen have been held in abeyance because of the parity dispute. Negotiations are scheduled to resume today between the patrolmen's union and Herbert L. Haber, city Labor Relations Director.

1116-> Solidity of Regime Of Duvalier in Haiti Reported Cracking
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6—The solidarity of the ruling group behind Jean‐Claude Duvalier, the new President of Haiti, be gan breaking as a power strug gle broke out between two of its key members, diplomatic sources said today. The sources said that the dis pute came into the open when the President's sister, Mrs. Ma rie‐Denise Dominique, abruptly resigned late yesterday as per sonal secretary to her brother, who is 20 years old. The 30‐year‐old Mrs. Domi nique has been influential in preserving the peaceful succes sion and in steering Haiti's new course toward international re spectability since President François Duvalier died on April 21. Involved in the dispute are Mrs. Dominique on one side and the Minister of Defense Lieut. Col. Luckner Carnbronne, on the other. Informed sources said the Mrs. Dominique was supported by her husband, Col. Max Dominique, and by the presidential guard battalion commanded by Col. Garcia Jacques. It was not known whether the 5,000‐man Haitian Army, commanded by Brig. Gen. Claude‐Louis Raymond, would throw in its lot with the Du valier family or with Colonel Cambronne. General Raymond and his brother, Adrien Raymond, who is Foreign Minister, have long been regarded as devoted fol lowers of the Duvalier family, which has ruled Haiti for 15 years. Unless Colonel Cam bronne has the backing of the Army, informed sources in Haiti said, he is likely to lose.

1117-> Israel to Stay in Talks Despite the Absence of Diplomatic Secrecy
JERUSALEM, Jan. 24 — The Israeli Cabinet agreed today on further ideas and questions to be put to the neighboring Arab governments, in pursuit of in direct peace talks through the United Nations intermediary, Dr. Gunnar V. Jarring. Premier Golda Meir and For eign Minister Abba Eban re portedly took the lead in urging that United Arab Republic po lemics and breaches of diplo matic secrecy not be used as a pretext for halting the discus sions, which were resumed Jan. 5. Israel is now interested in keeping the talks going, offi cials said. Accordingly, new in structions are expected to go to the representative at the United Nations, Yosef Tekoah in the next day or two. An official spokesman said after the Cabinet meeting that Mr. Eban had said that the Arab notes to Dr, Jarring had failed to reply to principal clauses in the Israeli proposals submitted to him two weeks ago in order to renew the talks with Egypt and Jordan. Those talks had been delayed since September. The principal omission in the Egyptian messages is under stood to be any reference to Israel's insistence on formal peace agreements With such agreements, Israel has declared her willingness to withdraw from at least some of the Arab territories occupied in the 1967 war; without such agreements, the Israelis say, there will be no withdrawal. Last Tuesday, when Egypt's reply to the Israeli initiative was received here from Dr. Jarring, in New York, senior officials were heartened by an apparent willingness to enter serious negotiations, even though there were no evident concessions. Within hours, however, word came of public denunciations of the Israeli position by Egyp tian spokesmen and the offic ial publication of the document that Cairo had submitted to Dr. Jarring. In the published form there were a number of additions — apparently not in the version submitted to Jer usalem — making tough and harsh points. In another atmosphere, Is raeli officials say, such a breach of the principles of quiet diplo macy and discretion would have justified a stern response. But now, when there appears to be a genuine effort under way to determine how real the chances are for serious nego tiations, there was apparently little Cabinet opposition to the proposal that this “static,” as one official termed it, be over looked. As the Cabinet spokesman put it: “Despite the polemical tone of the Egyptian note, the Gov ernment of Israel intends to continue the process of the talks via Ambassador Jarring with the aim of achieving peace agreements. The Government will, therefore, refrain from any moves which will hamper the conduct of the negotiations.” This appeared to be a state ment that Israel would not re spond to Egyptian publication of texts by publishing her own documents. Officials said the Government was determined to be discreet no matter what the other side did. A version of the Israeli 14 point memorandum submitted to Dr. Jarring was printed in the Paris‐based news magazine Jeune Afrique last week, and Israeli officials have subse quently confirmed its accuracy without officially endorsing it. Egypt said this week that she made public her text because Israel had leaked her position to the press.

1118-> MENDES RETURNS WITH BRASIL '66
Sergio Mendes brought a re vamped version of his Brasil '66 to Philharmonic Hall Satur day night for two perform ances. Gone was Lani Hall, the young singer who, in the last two years, had become the focal point of the group. And gone, too, was the finesse the group once had. The new Brasil '66 came on strong, relentless and very loud. Except for one number that gave the group's three percussionists opportunities to take solos, all the numbers were built around the vocal duets of Karen Phillipp and Gracinha, a black‐haired Brazil ian girl who has replaced Miss Hall. This led to a sense of same ness in the program that was emphasized by amplification raised to a Fillmore East level. The entire ensemble was often reduced to a rattling, racket ing barrage. Nonetheless, the audience at the evening's first performance responded enthu siastically. Brasil '66 was preceded by Peter Evans, a red‐bearded flamenco guitarist, and Don Sherman, a monologist.

1119-> East Side Democrats Hold Spirited Brunch
East Side Reformers, com fortably chic and comfortably Democratic, crowded the bal cony of the 86th Street Auto mat yesterday for a cham pagne and Bloody Mary brunch honoring Representa tives Shirley Chisholm and Bella Abzug. “The whole world is here,” said Miss Helene Hanff, pres ident of the Lenox Hill Demo cratic Club, surveying the tip pling crowd. “I thought it would be fun, and it is.” The affair was a fund‐rais ing event to pay the $275‐a month rent and other expenses of the club, whose turf gen erally runs from 59th to 79th Street east of Third Avenue. About 150 first‐generation swingers attended. Pants suits, big ties and inside jokes pre dominated. “Every month you have to come up with a new gim mick,” Miss Hanff, who is a writer, said of the event. “We've already had a cock tail party at Shepheard's and a softball tournament with another club.” Admission to the Automat balcony at 163 East 86th Street was $5, and partici pants were invited to drink all the champagne they could. Apparently to entice the newsmen, the brunch had been billed as a debate about Women's Liberation between Mrs. Chisholm and Mrs. Abzug on one side and Rep resentative Edward I. Koch on the other. The debate did not materialize. “I really can't comment on it,” said Mr. Koch, a Man hattan Democrat, eyeing his two putative opponents. “I don't want to get killed.” He did tell the crowd, how ever, of an undersized Con gressman who was reputedly exercizing with barbells preparatory to making a pass at Mrs. Abzug. The proceedings were frankly Democratic. Martin Begun, co‐leader of the club, told the assemblage that he had been in Washington last week. “Now I know what Paris was like under the German occupation,” he said. Most in his audience chuckled. Later, Mr. Begun tried to quiet the chattering crowd, which was engaged in sev eral dozen separate conver sations. “Lower your voices and pay attention,” he yelled. ‘Another Nixon,’ Mr. Koch remarked. Mr. Koch spoke of the city's use of hotels to house welfare clients. He said he knew of one family of 14 who had been put in the Roosevelt Hotel at $700 a week and were moved to the Broadway Central Hotel at $688.80 a week to save money. “This town is insane,” he said. “The administration is insane, is what I meant to say.” Mrs. Abzug, who last week began her first term, repre senting Manhattan's 19th District, hailed the election of more blacks and women to the 92d Congress. “We have labored too long, I think, under what is essen tially a white, male, middle class power structure,” she said. “We are prepared to fight against the military strangle hold that is keeping our. country from moving for ward.” Mrs. Chisholm, the Repre sentative from the 12th Dis trict in Brooklyn, said the changes made in the Con gressional seniority system last week were “a beautiful thing.” “At least we can tell the young people in this country, ‘don't give up yet on the sys tem, we have made improve ments,’” she said. She said she was happy to have Mrs. Abzug to help her against Congressional op ponents. “Now I can say, ‘I am going to get my sister Bella to take you on,’” Mrs. Chisholm said.

1120-> 4th‐Century Church Found in Jerusalem
JERUSALEM, March 2 — Greek archeologists have un earthed the remains of the basilica that the Roman Em peror Constantine built here in the fourth century at the site venerated as the one where Jesus was crucified and bushed. The Greek Orthodox Patri archate announced today that the stone constructions were found last month where the works of the early church fathers said they were. The remains were under the present high altar of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the Old City of Jerusalem. This church, shared by a number of Chris tian denominations, is under going extensive structural re novations. “We have always known that the original Con stantinian church must be there —now we have found it,” said Athanasios Economopoulos, of ficial architect of the Greek An tiquities and Restoration Ser vice, the technical office for the renovations under way here on behalf of the Greek Orthodox Church. “The most important of the Constantinian remains are an apse of 8.2 meters diameter [about 27 feet], a thick wall of 1.5 meters [about 5 feet] and the base of a column,” Mr. Economopoulos added in an in terview. They were found just a few feet under the present paving stones. He said that the discovery had been made on Feb. 18, as the Greek technicians were re modeling the altar sections of the church. The remains are about 30 feet from the tradi tional Rock of Calvary, revered as the site of the Crucifixion, and 150 feet from the tomb honored by the church as the spot where Jesus was buried. All these sacred sites are en closed under the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Greek Orthodox officials have been working since 1961 to restore the holy building, plagued by earthquake, fire and feuds among the Christian groups that claim control of the site. Besides the Greek Ortho dox Church, the main custo dians of the Holy Sepulcher are the Armenian Church and the Franciscan Order of the Roman Catholic Church. Renovation work and the re moval of the scaffolding that has marked the edifice for a decade or more is scheduled to be completed next year. The Constantinian remains have now been covered by tem porary flooring, to permit re ligious services before the high altar through Easter. After the holy days, Mr. Economopoulos said, he expects to reopen the site and to construct permanent arrangements for visitors to view the stone remains. The site of Jesus's death and burial has had a checkered his tory, as vying religions moved through Palestine. Church his torians believe that the actual locations were venerated by the earliest Christians, as testi fied in the New Testament Book of the Acts of the Apos tles. In determination to stamp out the new religious sect, the Emperor Hadrian built two pa gan altars, one to Jupiter and the other to Venus, on the sites in Jerusalem that the Christians considered holy. The presence of these tem ples was said to have been the clue by which the Christian con vert Helena, mother of the Em peror Constantine, determined the precise locations of the passion as described in the Gospels. In the year 333, the writings of an anonymous pilgrim of Bordeaux gave the first refer ence to the church that Con stantine, the first Christian Em peror of Rome, ordered con structed on the holy site. “Thence, about a stone's throw, is the crypt where His body was placed and rose the third day. There now, by order of the Emperor Constantine, a basilica is making,” the pilgrim wrote. The original basilica was burned by invading Persians in the year 614. A reconstruction was destroyed in 1009. The present Church of the Holy Sepulcher has its origins in Crusader times, though periodic fires and an earthquake in 1927 have caused its frequent re construction.

May we remind them that the Department of Film is alive and very well at the Museum on 53d Street, with two or three film showings every day except Christmas, plus an International Film Study Center, one of the world's largest private archives, a circulating film library, and innumerable other services available to film buffs and the general public. We are also happy to report that our young friends, the Department of Film at the Whitney Museum, the Anthology Cinema, and the New York Cultural Center are also thriving and in good spirits as a result of the public's interest in their efforts. The recent strike at The Museum of Modern Art brought to the attention of the public the fact that our cultural and educational institutions and museums are threatened by lack of funds. Moneys must be raised in this time of crisis to continue the services at these centers. Is it necessary to dismember the most architecturally distinguished building in the Lincoln Center complex, divert city funds and public support to three new movie houses, and lessen the chances of a new repertory theater company, when our own existing and proven cultural institutions are in such dire need? We would like to make an offer. The Department of Film would he happy to exhibit the collection of the Cinémathèque Française. We have excellent relations with other national film institutes and often exhibit films borrowed from foreign archives. If our offer is accepted, the Forum can remain intact, the people of New York can see the Langlois treasures, and the Cinémathèque Francaise can continue to serve the people of Paris.

1123-> Excerpts From Report on Securities Markets Submitted by Martin to Big Board
Following are excerpts from the report on securities markets submitted yesterday to the board of governors of the New York Stock Exchange by William McChesney Martin Jr.: Early this year, against a background of crisis in the securities industry, former chairman Bernard J. Lasker and the board of governors of the New York Stock Exchange unanimously re quested me to undertake a thorough study of the con stitution, rules and proce dures of the exchange. To assist in this under taking, a committee of in dustry leaders, not now serving on the board, was designated to advise, and they have been more than generous with their time and interest. None of the mem bers of this committee is responsible either individ ually or collectively for the views expressed in this report. The committee was com posed of: James W. Davant, Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis; Walter N. Frank, Walter N. Frank & Co.; James Crane Kellogg, Spear, Leeds & Kellogg; Gustave L. Levy, Goldman, Sachs & Co.; Clifford W. Michel, Loeb, Rhoades & Co.; Donald T. Regan, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.; and Henry M. Watts, Jr., Mitchel, Schreiber, Watts & Co. I have also been ably as sisted in my work by Mr. Donald A. E. Beer, an inde pendent consultant, and Mr. George A. Jensen, legal counsel, a member of the firm of Pepper, Martin, Jen sen, Maichel and Hetlage of St. Louis, and by a very efficient secretary, Miss Geraldine Nahra. In making this study, I sought the views of all seg ments of the financial com munity both inside and outside of the securities in dustry. It became clear very early that neither the study nor my recommendations could be confined to the New York Stock Exchange, and that the securities industry as a whole must be encom passed. In this report, I have not attempted to set forth de tailed analyses with support ing data. The issues have been extensively documented elsewhere. My recommenda tions and conclusions are intended to identify goals to be pursued in the public in terest, without precluding modifications. I would em phasize the fact that some changes may be appropriate within the major thrust of the study. When I accepted this task, it was clearly understood that the public interest would he the paramount considera tion in appraising the issues. The public interest dictates that the primary purpose of a securities market is to raise capital to finance the econ omy. Without continuous capital formation, our econ omy could not grow or prosper. It could not provide job opportunities to our growing labor force, it could not sustain a rising standard of living. It could not gen erate economic opportunities so vital to the health of our free enterprise system. It could not assist government in its programs to lessen so cial problems such as poverty, pollution and crime. By con tributing to the mobilization of capital, a stock exchange the entire population. In fulfilling this principal role, a stock exchange must also serve those who have already committed their capi tal to finance the economy. It must enable them to re convert their securities into cash whenever their needs re quire. Investor confidence in the ability to resell securities on fair terms is critical. Public confidence depends in large measure on the en vironment which surrounds a public market. Full dis closure, responsibility and financial soundness of the in dustry participants are im portant. A multitude of sources of information and opinions about stock values will contribute to proper pricing. When stock certifi cates are immobilized or elim inated, confidence will depend even more than now on fi nancial soundness of brokers and their agency relationship with their customers. In recent years, the old fa miliar patterns in the securi ties industry have been dis rupted by the appearance of two new forces: institutional investors and computers. By mobilizing capital, the insti tutional investors have ac quired the power to influ ence the way markets are made. Computers, because of the communication systems they make possible, offer the means to radically improve the way markets operate. Both of these forces have developed apart from the New York Stock Exchange. Together, they have had a pronounced impact on the New York Stock Exchange's performance as the principal market. The result has been that many transactions in securi ties listed on the New York Stock Exchange have been executed on various other exchanges, and in the third and fourth markets. This dispersion of trading from central auction market is fragmentation of that mar ket. This fragmentation has been lauded by some who contend that competition be tween markets is desirable. But for competition to be beneficial, it must exist under similar rules and in the same arena. Competition between mar kets has not been beneficial because it has depended upon unequal regulation which, among other things, has not required full disclosure and equal responsibility of par ticipants. Differences in dis closure of information about activity in these markets and differences in access to these markets have made it increas ingly difficult for the public and fiduciaries alike to ob tain the best prices available, at given time. As inflation and inflation ary expectations rose in re cent years, the securities industry was ill‐prepared for the unexpected syndrome of go‐go speculation for short term performance. Volume exploded, prices soared, then later plunged, and distortions became alarming as paper jammed the system. The sys tem was in disarray; it could not stand the strain. In retrospect, it is clear that the Securities and Ex change Commission, together with the New York Stock Exchange and all the other markets and exchanges, were caught off guard and were unprepared or unable to cope with the situation. Clearly, what has happened in the past five years calls for re examination and improve ment in the machinery of administration and self‐reg ulation. In response, Con gress is in the process of preparing for hearings that seem destined to lead to a new securities act. To serve the interests of the public and the nation, as well as the interests of the securities industry itself, a national exchange system must be developed to provide a single, national auction market for each security qualified for listing. Such a system would integrate the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Ex change and the regional ex changes. Because of their geograph ical locations and their iden tification with local nceds, the regional exchanges have a vital role to play in mak ing a truly national system. To accomplish this, the struc ture of the market mechan ism must be redesigned and modernized. The creation of such a na tional exchange system would provide one market ior each listed security. There could be two or more divi sions within this national ex change system. The present listing requirements of the New York and American Stock Exchanges might pro vide appropriate listing re quirements for two such divi sions. Whether all securities which meet the listing re quirements for a particular division of the national ex change system should be re quired to be listed for trading in that division should be considered. Securities which are not listed on any division of the national exchange system would be traded in the over the‐counter market. Securi ties should be traded either in a single division of the national exchange system or in the over‐the‐counter mar ket, not in both markets. The New York Stock Ex change has, to some extent, all of the characteristics pre scribed above for the pro posed national exchange sys tem. To improve its present role, the New York Stock Exchange should be reorgan ized. This reorganization should proceed promptly and not await formation of the proposed national exchange system. The following plan of re organization is recommended: 1. The exchange would be a cor poration. 2. — The board of directors would consist of 20 individuals plus a voting chairman whom the board would elect. Ten directors would be elected by vote of the member firms from the of ficers, partners and pro prietors of the member firms, and 10 directors would initially be elected from the public by vote of the member firms. 3. — The principal officer of the exchange would be the chairman of the board of directors who would be the chief execu tive officer of the ex change. The chairman would be elected by the board of directors and would be required to sever any ties with any member firm of the exchange or any other business. Sub ject to the approval of the board of directors, the chairman would appoint a president (who would be his chief operating officer) and all other necessary of ficers. 4. present seats on the exchange would each he converted into 10 shares. All such shares would be owned and held by and in the name of the member firms (which could be corporations, partnerships or individuals doing business as member firm sole proprietorships). Each share would entitle the owner thereof to one vote on all matters voted upon, with cumulative vot ing rights for the election of the 10 non‐public mem bers of the board of di rectors. 5. — Owner ship of one share would make the owner thereof eligible to become a mem ber firm of the exchange with the right to deal in all securities listed on the exchange in accordance with the rules of the ex change, but the ownership of 10 shares would be re quired to enable a member firm to place a representa tive on the floor of the exchange or to be a clear ing member of the ex chaige. Many member firms of the New York Stock Exchange need additional capital to meet present and future re quirements. The basis on which this capital will be ac quired is very important. The events of recent years have demonstrated dramatically the importance of permanent equity or “cash” capital, and the need for permanent capi tal cannot be overempha sized. The need for tremendous amounts of capital to finance the day‐to‐day operations of the industry precludes any arbitrary or sudden change in the present use of free credit balances. Much of Wall Street could not operate to day without these balances. However, it would be reason able to impose gradually a segregation requirement with respect to a percentage of properly defined credit bal ances which would require investment in unencumbered short‐term United States Government and Govern ment‐agency securities. A market with liquidity is one in which the investor can readily convert his se curities into cash at a price close to the last sale. On the New York Stock Exchange, liquidity has historically de pended upon the specialist system which is designed to absorb the frequent imbal ance between buy and sell orders. The increasing insti tutionalization of the market has placed heavy demands upon the specialist system. The growth of the block posi tioners has helped provide the liquidity demanded by the institutions. A high de gree of understanding and cooperation is necessary be tween the specialists and block positioners to maintain a market with good liquidity. There has been a great deal of criticism of the role and function of specialists. However, no better system of maintaining a continuous and responsible market has been suggested. The capital re sources of specialists, how ever, should be increased to meet the requirements of to day's trading, and methods should be developed to en courage and enable special ists to improve performance of their functions in in stances where securities are offered in unusually large volume. In general, better adminis tration of rules and regula tions pertaining to specialists is needed. More, rather than fewer, specialists and market makers are needed, who are better capitalized, with clear ly defined responsibilities and subject to uniform regula tions. Block traders, who have re cently assumed an increas ingly important role in the market, present a problem of growing urgency. Block trad ing, unless prudently con ducted, can substantially frustrate public participation in the market and the orderly operation of the market. Rules and regulations speci fying the qualifications for those firms which may act as block positioners and defin ing their obligations to the public marketplace should be developed, and a closer working relationship between block positioners and special ists should be required. Unequal (different) regula tion exists both within the listed market among the ex changes and between the list ed market and the over‐the counter market. In order to prevent further fragmentation of the market pending new legislation and the creation of the national exchange system, it is rec ommended that the Securities and Exchange Commission take appropriate action to re solve all differences in regu lation to the extent possible within the scope of its juris diction. The question of institu tional membership involves several overriding considera tions. One is the concentra tion of economic power which might result from in stitutional membership. An other is that institutional membership could lead to a market dominated by dealers dealing for their own account and tend toward the elimina tion of the agency relation ship between broker and cus tomer. A third, and perhaps paramount consideration, is the necessity of recognizing and preserving the difference between the securities busi and other businesses. This separation should be maintained not only to facili tate regulation, but also be cause of the unique profes sional role that the public exchange auction market plays in a very sensitive part of the mechanism of the free enterprise system. According ly, it is recommended that the primary purpose of every member organization and any parent of any member corporation should continue to be “the transaction of business as a broker or deal er in securities” as presently provided in New York Stock Exchange Rule 318. This rule, in effect, pro hibits membership by banks, trust companies, insurance companies, mutual funds and other institutions. It should he noted that the purchase of 25 per cent or less of the voting securities of a mem ber corporation by an insti tution is not prohibited. If institutions are denied membership in the New York Stock Exchange, as herein recommended, member firms of the New York Stock Ex change should be required to divest themselves, over a rea sonable period of time and in a manner which will protect the interests of the share holders of such funds, of any direct or indirect ownership or control of management or advisory companies of open or closed‐end management investment companies, and any investment advisory con tracts between member firms and such companies or their managers also should be pro hibited in order to avoid the use of such contracts to ef fect control of the operation of such companies. Unavoidable conflicts of interest arise when money management and brokerage functions are combined with in a single profit‐making firm, regardless of whether a fee is paid for investment advice. It is believed, how ever, that these conflicts of interest have been reason ably well handled by the member firms. Serious consideration has been given to the frequent suggestion that the clearest solution to the whole prob lem of money management would be to separate all man agement and brokerage. How ever, the giving of advice, historically, has been an in herent and logical part of the brokerage business. Accor dingly, except for the prohi bition previously recommend ed with respect to open or closed‐end management in vestment companies, member firms should be permitted to engage in all other forms of money management, but they should be prohibited from crediting commissions against any fee charged for invest ment advice. The term “negotiated rates” is only accurate in some cases. For the millions of individual investors, there will be no negotiation. Bro kers will determine their own rates, and the individual in vestor will either pay them or will not trade. Only in the case of very large investors, usually insti tutions, is there likely to be any negotiation. Even here, special rates for particular customers are likely to be more frequent than ne gotiated rates. Commission charges for institutional or ders can be given appropriate treatment within a fixed commission structure. The resolution of this problem does not of itself require ne gotiated rates. The success with which capital has been raised to fi nance the economy in the United States is due in part to the dispersion and local activities of a multitude of broker‐dealers. Fully negoti ated rates may cause a sub stantial concentration of the securities business in a few large firms. Because of the strategic importance of the securities industry to the op eration of the free enterprise capitalistic system, control of this industry cannot be permitted to be concentrated in the hands of a few per sons or firms. Such a concen tration of power could not be tolerated even on the grounds of efficiency. Negotiated rates may not have this effect. They may only serve to eliminate the inefficient, poorly managed broker‐dealers. No one knows the answer to this question, but an abrupt change to fully‐negotiated rates would be imprudent at a time when the industry needs continued earnings to accumulate and attract cap ital. The experiment now under way with negotiated commissions on transactions above $500,000 requires ex perience and analysis before the Securities and Exchange Commission and the ex changes proceed further. The court decisions to date leave the question of anti trust exemption for ex changes far from clear. Con sequently, exchanges face the choice of either regulat ing at their peril, or not reg ulating at all. This is an untenable position for the exchanges which are re quired to regulate their mem bers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This dilemma is an obvious deter rent to effective self‐regula tion which must be remedied. A reorganization of the New York Stock Exchange substantially along the lines of the plan herein proposed will properly reflect the ex change's quasi‐public nature and qualify it for exemption from the antitrust laws. Ac cordingly, it is recommended that the exchange ask the Congress to enact legislation granting all registered na tional securities exchanges certain immunity under the antitrust laws. The state of the art of computer communication technology now greatly ex ceeds applications in the se curities markets. A major ob stacle to efficient utilization of the available communica tion technology is the stock certificate. Delays and diffi culties in the transfer of stock certificates have al ready contributed to the col lapse of many firms and were among the major factors re sponsible for curtailment of trading hours in 1968. Uni versal cooperation towards a single solution to this com mon problem is the only sen sible approach. Total elimination of the stock certificate, which has been advocated by Mr. Wil liam J. Casey, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, should be the eventual objective to be reached as soon as possible. A period of five to 10 years will probably be required to do this. One area in which the New York Stock Exchange can re establish leadership is in the development of a single “consolidated exchange” tape which is technologically feas ible today. It should be under taken immediately to pro vide complete disclosure of material information to all investors. Price and volume for every transaction in any stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange should be reported on this consolidated tape at the time of execution regardless of where the trade took place, whether on the New York Stock Ex change, on a regional ex change, in the third market, in the fourth market, or any thing else. Many of the recommenda tions made, herein can be im plemented by the New York Stock Exchange alone, others require action by the Con gress, the Securities and Ex change Commission or the other exchanges either acting alone or together with the New York Stock Exchange. The following is a brief out line of the principal recom mendations in each category: 1. Reorganization of the New York Stock Exchange. 2. Continuous review and emphasis on the financial soundness of member firms. 3. Additional regulation and improvement of the role of the specialists and the block positioners. 4. Prohibition of institutional membership and prohibition of member firrri manage ment of mutual funds. 5. Prohibition of crediting commissions against any fee charged for investment advice. 6. Greater use of modern communication systems. Recommendations to Be Implemented by the Congress, the Securi ties and Exchange Commission and the Other Exchanges Ei ther Acting Alone or in Concert With the New York Stock Ex change: 1. Development of a national exchange system providing a national auction market for each listed security. 2. Consideration of increased requirements for entry into the securities business by broker‐dealers. 3. Adoption of appropriate segregation requirements with respect to free credit balan ces. 4. Resolution of the differ ences which result in uh equal regulation and the elimination of the “third market,” preferably through the development of a na tional exchange system. 5. Additional time to be given to the experiment with negotiated rates before any further change is made. 6. The enactment of legisla tion granting antitrust ex emption to the exchanges coexistent with Securities and Exchange Commission oversight. 7. A coordinated effort to eliminate the stock certifi cate. S. Development of a “con solidated‐exchange” tape. The securities industry may be on the threshold of another period of great ex pansion. The number of shareholders and the volume of trading may more than double in the next 10 years if the character of the mar ket is oriented in favor of the public. The challenge is to reorganize and to improve the securities industry so that it will serve the public and the national economy better. The principal thrust should be the creation of a national exchange system and re organization of the New York Stock Exchange. The utmost effort and coopera tion will be required from all of the exchanges, the Na tional Association of Securi ties Dealers, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Congress to accom plish this.

1125-> War Foe Quits Army; West Point Graduate
WASHINGTON, March 9 (AP)—First Lieut. Louis P. Font, the West Point graduate whose opposition to the Vietnam war has kept him out of Southeast Asia and in one controversy after another for a year, has submitted his resignation at the Army's request, he said today. Lieutenant Font, 24 years old, of Kansas City, Mo., told a reporter in a telephone interview that he offered his formal resignation last week, in response to a request from Col. A. W. Alexander, commander of Fort Meade, Md. The lieutenant said the general wrote him Feb. 23 saying that Lieutenant. Font had been late to work, spent too much time on the telephone and showed “unwillingness to expend any effort in the performance of duties.” Lieutenant Font said the two‐page staternent made no reference to his participation in antiwar activities or his charges now pending against four high ranking Army officers on various matters.

1126-> Fruitcakes Are Recalled Because a Few Are Unfit
WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 (UPI) —The Food and Drug Administration announced today the recall of about 4,000 Barton's fruitcakes in two‐pound tins because a few samples were contaminated with moths and moth larvae. It said the cakes were unlikely to cause illness and credited Barton's Candy Corporation of Brooklyn with having initiated the recall. A Barton's spokesman said consumers could return the cakes to stores for refunds. He said the moths had been found in pecans purchased from other suppliers and emphasized that most Barton's fruitcakes on the market were not contaminated.

1127-> Photography
COMPACT rangefinder version of Yashica's Electro‐35 has recently been introduced. Called the Electro‐35CC, It comes with a wide angle 35mm lens and the same type of automatic electronic shutter with an infinite range of speeds from eight seconds to 1/250th of a second. A CdS sensor in the lens barrel automatically presets the lens aperture (from f/1.8 to f/16) and the shutter speed to match the light available so that all the user need do is focus and press the shutter release button. The 35CC also has an exposure symbol that lights up in the viewfinder with a red signal for and yellow one for a slow shutter speed (indicating a tripod is needed or that the aperture ring should be turned to a wideropening). Priced at under $130, the Yashica‐35CC is less than 4¾ inches wide. An evening program in photojournalism is again being offered at the Germain School of Photography, 225 Broadway, starting on Tuesday from 7 to 10 P.M.

1129-> Ivan Davis Presents a Program Entirely of Non‐Piano Pieces
If there is one thing con cert‐goers share nowadays, it is a hunger for novelty. Some performers have come to re alize this and are beginning to break out of the repertory straitjackets that have made thousands upon thousands of programs almost indistin guishable from one another over the last two decades. At Hunter College Play house Saturday night, Ivan Davis took a giant step in a direction that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. He played a piano re cital that consisted almost entirely of transcriptions of works composed for other musical media. Liszt, the king of piano transcribers, furnished the second half of the program, which consisted of his key board versions of the “Lie bestod” from Wagner's “Tris tan and Isolde,” two songs each by Schubert and Schu mann, and the Paraphrase on Mendelssohn's “A Midsum mer Night's Dream.” The first half offered Bu soni's transcription of Bach's Chaconne in D minor for un accompanied violin and of Weber's Sonata in C (Op. 24) as gussied up by Adolf von Henselt. This last is not pre cisely a transcription, but since it is the result of one man's tampering with music composed by another, it is a near neighbor. Virtually all these pieces are so thick with notes that relatively few pianists could play them competently even if they wanted to, and most of those who could would not consider the effort worth while. Since Mr. Davis is a vir tuoso of uncommon facility, he flashed through them with remarkable vigor and pre cision. The final movement of the otherwise tedious Weber‐Henselt Sonata and almost the whole of the “Midsummer Night's Dream” Paraphrase were truly daz zling in execution. Unfortunately, Mr. Davis played almost everything at a high tension level and with piano tone that was on the hard side and too consistent ly loud. This did not allow for the creation of much sen suousness of sound in the “Liebestod” or the projection of tender lyricism in, say, the Schubert‐Liszt “Standchen.” As a result, the recital took on more the aspect of a bravura keyboard demonstra tion than a well‐rounded musical experience. Piano transcriptions may not repre sent the ultimate in musical art, but they surely deserve to be treated with more sensi tivity than Mr. Davis gave them on this occasion. If he could learn to treat them more lovingly in the fu ture, he might open up a whole new realm of musical enjoyment for many listeners.

1130-> Theater: Arena Stage's ‘Ruling Class’
WASHINGTON—The Arena Stage opened its new Kree ger Theater last week with the American premiere of Peter Barnes's “The Ruling Class — a double‐barreled event of great theatrical im portance. The Kreeger, which adjoins the Arena's open‐stage thea ter, has a back wall but no permanent proscenium. It is a flexible space for perform ing, and a comfortable, at tractive one for viewing. The 500 seats are banked. Sight lines are excellent. Arcs of light suspended over the au dience give the interior a marquee effect. The opening of the $1.5‐ million Kreeger, when other theaters are cutting back, is an act of courage on the part of the Arena's producing di rector, Zelda Fichandler. The courage is compound ed by the choice of opening play. “The Ruling Class” is an outrageous, lunatic com edy. When it was first staged in 1968 in England, it created an uproar, and one can see why. With understated wit, it savages the Church, educa tion, Parliament, the upper classes, the Empire, the “im aginary island” of Britain. Actually the play — Mr. Barnes calls it “a baroque comedy”—is about life as an inane asylum, and it is as pertinent and timely today in America as it doubtless was in England. • In a brief, tone‐setting pro logue—the most outlandish things are presented in the most matter‐of‐fact way— we are introduced to the 13th Earl of Gurney, an up standing member of the House of Lords (in other words a Blimpish reaction ary). He has one quirk: At bedtime he dons a tutu and cocked hat and pretends to hang himself. This night, an accident occurs, and the Earl swings high. The Gurney family is as tonished at the suicide, pri marily because this normal lord will be succeeded by his crazy son Jack, who has been confined to an institution as a paranoid‐schizophrenic. They don't know how (in) sane he really is. Enter Jack in Franciscan tunic and be atific smile with the follow ing news: He is Christ Him self. “Simple,” he explains his assumption of the Role, “When I pray to Him, I find I'm talking to myself.” He could be the real Christ and it would make no dif ference to his haughty clan — boorish Uncle Charles, lecherous Lady Claire, and their boobish son Dinsdale. The only person besides Jack with an ounce of sense is the servant, old Dan Tucker, a disrespectful scamp, who is trapped by the habit of serv ing. Even though Tucker is heir to the old lord's money, he is unable to break away from his station (he occasion ally breaks into song and dance). The plot to disinherit, dis credit and certify Jack is the main line of the play. Finally Jack, the madman‐as‐Christ, is exorcised of his delusion. Happy Jack is not made any more. Now he is Jack the Ripper, a lady‐killing vam pire, but with a sheen of class. “Bring back fear,” demands the monster ‐ as ‐ hypocrite, and fittingly takes his seat in Parliament. This devious, literate com edy is offered in a rainbow of styles—farce, parody, sat ire, parable. It is full of ironies and surprises, and never forgets its own play fulness. Whenever things taste even slightly of senti mentality or melodrama, the author, instead of shrinking, leaps into pop tunes: “Mairzy Doats,” “Varsity Drag.” As the restored Jack extols the virtue of the hangman, he lapses into “Dry Bones,” and two stuffy church ladies join him stage‐front for a turn. Somehow the vaudeville works perfectly, making the play funnier without robbing it of its essential blackness. • It is a very difficult play to stage, not only because of its eclectic style, but also be cause of its expanse—it has many short scenes, many characters, and startling en trances. Probably it would go best on a full proscenium. David Williams's produc tion misses some of the script's bite, at times seems flaccid when it should fly. But considering the compact ness of the Kreeger, Mr. Wil liams and the set designer, Leo Kerz, have been very re sourceful. “The Ruling Class” needs superb comic actors. This cast in some roles, lacks lightness and finesse. In some cases accents waver. I think the play would benefit from a British cast. But Eric House is highly amusing as the servant, mak ing him into a modern Shake spearean clown, and Douglas Rain is splendid as Jack, leaping from seraph to devil, from sweet serenity to raving mania, stopping to soft‐shoe a number or two, and never letting you forget the cracked psyche beneath the comic mask.

1131-> Art
T has taken the Asia Society five years to get the loans for “Ancient Indonesian Art,” an exhibition that opened Thursday, from their home museums in Djakarta, Djokjakarta, and Solo to its quarters at 112 East 64th Street, where you may see them until Nov. 28. At an early stage of confused negotiations (“confused” being a redundant adjective in context) the Djakarta press broke the story that a band of Americans had appeared in town bearing a list of the finest works of art owned by the government of Indonesia, with God knows what skullduggery in mind. Gordon Washburn, the director of Asia House Gallery and the very model of respectability, cast for the first time as a shady bloke in a Graham Greene thriller, had in hand nothing more sinister than the list of loans he had proposed in an exploratory letter, to which he had received an unusually compliant response. He found himself the center of a piquant situation when the museum authorities failed to recognize the letter, which had been written by an openhanded but unauthorized associate. Negotiations had to begin in earnest at the usual level for an Asia House exhibition, which means from ambassadors on up. But agreeing on the exhibition list was only the first hurdle. Thereafter on a series of occasions the loans were scheduled to arrive by planes that reached Kennedy Airport safely but, as far as Asia House was concerned, empty. The difficulty had been to find responsible carriers to the Djakarta airport for national treasures so vulnerable that their exit from the country had to be as carefully guarded as that of a chief of state in a time of seige. One purpose of the Asia House exhibitions is to further international understanding, and if any exhibition can do it, this one should. Serene and sparkling, it bears no marks of its difficult history —and this history is, of course, quite extraneous to its conclusion, which is a wondrous collection of sculptures and objects perfectly displayed. The only reason for beginning these comments with a couple of anecdotes is that they afford a new introduction to substitute for “Another beautiful show has opened at Asia House,” which in one variation or another perforce became standard some years ago. “Ancient Indonesian Art of the Central and Eastern Javanese Periods” (the exhibition's full title) may be the finest of these shows so far, if comparisons at such a level make any difference. It should certainly be the most rewarding to a wide audience by reason of its variety. The objects range from massive stone Buddhas to a fragmentary silhouette of a human body, cut from a thin sheet of gold, that in a pinch could have been slipped into an airmail envelope for delivery to East 64th Street. There are diminutive sculptures — a couple of inches high, or less — of fantastic complexity in contrast with the broad, noble forms of the big stones. There are gods and there are earrings, ceremonial bells and mirror handles, a rich, harmonious mixture of majesty and vivacity, profundity and playfulness, celestial repose and demonic vigor. The greatest of the Javanese Buddhist figures — there is one here from the incomparable monument of Borobudur — are unsurpassed by any in India and China or elsewhere, surely, but my experience with Indonesian sculpture in general has been that it demands less in the way of iconographic knowledge and philosophical understanding than other eastern arts either sacred or profane. There is a theatricality about much of it that makes it unusually accessible to us — although “theatricality” is a dangerous word and must not be taken here to mean flashiness. Perhaps this apparent theatricality is in fact only an absence of austerity or a tendency to divert technical discipline in the direction of sheer visual elegance rather than toward mystical expression. Even in the most reserved, the most tranquil, the most reflective faces of their deities the Javanese sculptors seem to have been unwilling to relinquish the seductions of physical allure to achieve a pure philosophical essence. And no wonder, since the people of that island are the most beautiful in the world. At least this is true today, and it must have been true 1200 years ago to account for the beauty of one fragment — a head of a monk, number four in the catalogue —from the eighth century and his sculptural descendants through the fourteenth, the chronological boundaries of this exhibition. The Museum Pusat in Djakarta, the Sana Budaja Museum in Djokjakarta, the Raja Pustaka Museum in Solo, and the National Archeological Institute of Indonesia, which has several branches, have lent the 111 objects in this exhibition — all of them, so far as I know, being shown in this country for the first time. The museums are vast storehouses; to winnow this representative fraction of their treasures was a feat in itself, and the catalog by Jan Fontein, R. Soekmono and Satyawati Suleiman is an introduction to Indonesian art that includes, as well, basic references to architectural monuments. The exhibition will travel to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the NelsonAtkins Gallery in Kansas City and the Center of Asian Art and Culture, San Francisco. Asia House is open Monday‐Friday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Saturday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sunday from 1 P.M. to 5 P.M.

1134-> Tie‐Dye Fabrics From the Reservation
Mrs. Alice Begay, her 18‐ year‐old daughter, Virginia, and her 4‐month‐old grand son, Christopher, made their first visit to New York recently. The two women head. Red Rock Tie‐Dyeing Inc., a concern based on the Navajo Indian Reservation at Gallup, N, M., Chistopher, ensconced on a bead decorated cradle‐board, came along for the ride. Mrs. Begay and her daugh ter, two of the newest recruits to the fashion industry, turn out wood block tie‐dye fabrics that an now being sold in the nation's most sophisticated cities. They have already produced about 1,200 yards of natural cot ton muslin fabric, most of it dyed in traditional Indian designs and colors and some of it done in abstract de signs that might have emerged from modern paintings. Their business was organ ized last summer when the women of Red Rock, one of the communities on the res ervation, were invited to meet Will and Eileen Rich ardson, founders of Up Tied, a tie‐dye concern. The Be gays, who were among those introduced to the technique, were sufficiently interested to turn their newly acquired skill into a self‐help project. Mrs. Begay, who works at the tie‐dyeing and supervises the six women wno assist in the project, and Virginia, who looks after most of the business details, were here to demonstrate their dyeing technique at B. Altman & Co. They also bought a few souvenirs at the Empire State Building and came to the firm conclusion that New York was a nice place to visit. “I wouldn't want to live here,” said Virginia, who was wearing one of her own tie‐dye designs in a skirt. “It seems hard and it's sort of dirty.” Her preconceived idea of New York as a city of tall buildings was not shattered. “It's hard to believe,” she said. “The traffic is hard to believe too!” Mrs. Begay, white wool yarn tied at the back of her hair, a red Navajo blanket (“made in Oregon, I think”) flung around her shoulders and silver and turquoise jewelry at her ears, neck and wrists, wrote off the city as “too big and too crowded.” The fabric is produced in colors of brown, wine, or ange, blue, tan and green on a natural background. The designs, among them highly stylized butterflies, clouds and mountains, are achieved by folding and placing the muslin between shaped wooden blocks. The blocks are then clamped together and the fabric immersed in dye. The original project and the visit here were partly sponsored by Rit Dyes. The women, who now work In a warehouse without heat, electricity or running water, have been using their prof its to pay their helpers ($1.60 an hour) and to buy fabrics and dyes. The Southwest In dian Foundation is hoping to alleviate the difficult work ing conditions (heating water over wood fires) by obtaining water and commercial gas stoves. The fabric, available at Altman's, is sold in three‐ yard cuts, each rolled and tied with a leather thong and Red Rock seal. It sells for about $9.

1135-> GOLDWATER ASSAILS DECISION BY TIMES
BOSTON, June 23 (AP)—Sen ator Barry Goldwater, the un successful Republican presiden tial candidate in 1964, wrote in Thursday's edition of The Chris tian Science Monitor that The New York Times “showed a shocking lack of responsibility” in publishing a Pentagon study on the history of the Vietnam war. “I want to make it clear, however,” Senator Goldwater said, “that I believe the Ameri can people have a right to know when their leaders are planning an action that might cost thou sands of lives and billions of dollars, when this can be done without endangering the secu rity of our nation.” The Arizona Senator said that the American people have a right to know “when the de cision is made—not seven years later, after the expenditure of many thousands of lives and billions of dollars.” “The New York Times has more than a duty to its read ers,” he said, “it has a higher, more demanding duty to re spect the decisions of its Gov ernment regarding the defense and the protection of 205 mil lion Americans. … When a pa per is labeled ‘secret’ or ‘classifled’ in the Government of the United States, it is labeled that way by men whose job it is to make such decisions, and I might add, by men chosen by leaders elected by the people of the United States.”

1136-> A CHINESE LEADER RETAINS POWER
HONG KONG, Feb. 21—De spite an absence from public view of almost five months, Wei Kuo‐ching, the veteran po litical leader of the Kwangsi autonomous region, has not been purged. He emerged today as head of a newly formed Chinese Com munist party committee for the region, which borders North Vietnam. Until today Mr. Wei had, not been mentioned in press or ra dio reports from Communist China” for almost sixth months. Many observers had concluded that he had been maneuvered from office. The Kwangsi lead er had been under prolonged and bitter attack by radical partisans of Chiang Ching, the wife of Mao Tse‐tung, during the 1967–68 period of the Cul tural Revolution. Mr. Wei, a member of the largest minority group in China, the Chuangs, was governor and political commissar for Kwang si at the start of the Cultural Revolution. He successfully fought efforts to oust him as a revisionist “following the cap italist road.” The struggle between Mr: Wei and his opponents became so fierce that Kwangsi in the spring and summer of 1968 was torn by armed conflict There were reports at the time that railways carrying war supplies to North Vietnam were dis rupted, and that a battle for the river port of Wuchow destroyed a third of the city and killed hundreds. Mr. Wei consistently pro fessed his loyalty to Mao Tse tung and uttered the same Cul tural Revolution slogans as his attackers. Mr. Wei and his fac tion were reconfirmed in au thority by Peking and he head ed the revolutionary commit tee that took over as the rul ing body for the, region. Kwangsi, with a population of 24,000,000, is called an au tonomous region because it is the home of China's 8,000,000 Chuangs, the largest minority group in China. But the major ity Hans, or Chinese, people are the dominant community of Kwangsi, and the region's sys tem of government differs little from that of a regular Chinese province. Stability in Kwangsi is an important consideration for Peking because the region serves as a rear area for the Vietnam war. North Vietnam ese military personnel are trained in Kwangsi and conva lescent hospitals and other in stallations for North Vietnam's war effort are reportedly in the region. Reports have reached here from time to time of strong opposition to the Chinese Com munist regime from the Chu angs, a stocky, stubborn moun tain people with their own language and customs. The political survival of Mr. Wei, who is believed to be 64, may be due to his ability to deal with this dissent. He is a mem ber of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist party. The Kwangsi committee is the ninth regional party com mittee to be formed in a drive to re‐create the party at local and regional levels after the disruption of the Cultural Rev olution.

1137-> City to Buy Yankee Stadium In Move to Keep 2 Teams
In a move to keep the New York Yankees baseball team and the Football Giants here, Mayor Lindsay an nounced yesterday that the city planned to buy and modernize the 48‐year‐old Yankee Stadium, then lease it to the baseball club. If an agreement to buy the ball park cannot be reached, the Mayor said, the city would take it through condemnation proceedings. Asked at a City Hall news conference how he could jus tify committing $24‐million in city funds for the plans in the face of a critical money short age, the Mayor stressed that the money would, not be taken from his hard‐pressed expense budget, which provides for wages and operations. Instead, he explained, 25 per cent of the funds would come from the capital budget for pub lic construction that is financed by borrowing. The 75 per cent remaining would be raised out side the city's mandated debt limit by floating anticipation notes to be redeemed from pro ceeds from parking, concessions and leases. “It will be a strain on the budget,” the Mayor said, “but we are committed to it and we need to do it.” After acquiring the property through purchase or condem nation, the Mayor said, the city would lease the ball park to the Yankees on the sane terms it leases city‐owned Shea Sta dium to the New York Mets. That lease allows the ball dull an absolute veto over changes in the structure and subleases for other sports or events. The stadium, which has bulged with 70,000 baseball fans and has attracted 100,000 to religious rites, would be ren ovated by the Yankees, with the city ultimately footing the bill. The stadium's seating ca pacity is expected to be in creased slightly. The announcement of the plan was the culmination of nine months of negotiations by the Mayor to keep the Yankees and Football Giants here. It was greeted enthusiastically by Bronx legislators and Michael Burke, president of the New York Yankees. Mr Burke said the Yankees would certainly stay in the city “if things work out.” He ac knowledged that the ball club had stopped talking and nego tiating with New Jersey offic ials who had been trying to move the team across the river. A spokesman for Gov. Wil liam T. Cahill said that New Jersey would continue its ef forts to attract the teams until “notified by officials of the ma jor league teams that they no longer have any interest in moving.” Councilman Mario Merola, chairman of the Conncil's Fi nance Committee, said that'aft er acquiring the property the city would probably operate the stadium at an annual loss of $300,000 the same as for Shea Stadium. However, he interjected quickly, the loss would be more than made up in terms of out of‐towners visiting the stadium, staying at hotels and motels and, spending money here. The stadium, at 161st Street and River Avenue, the Bronx, is owned by Rice University and the land is owned by the Knights of Columbus. Malcolm Lovett, chairman of the Board of Trustees of Rice University, said last night that the announcement had come as a surprise to the university. “We just don't know any thing about it,” he said. “I guess in due time somebody will approach us.” John W. McDevitt, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Colum bus, said that tentative dis cussions about buying the sta dium land had been held, but that no figures had been dis cussed. The Yankees lease the property, pay maintenance costs and local taxes as well as fixed annual rentals. They sub let the stadium to the Football Giants. The Yankees have repeatedly complained to Rice University of conditions in the stadium, a spokesman at City Hall said yesterday, and Rice officials have said that they had no money for modernization. As the first step in the plan, legislation was introduced yes terday before the Legislature in Albany to permit the city to acquire the property as a pub lic place, lease it to the Yankees and permit them to renovate the proposed city property. The entire property is assessed at a total of $5‐million. City of ficials believe that it could be bought for not too much more. The remainder of the money in the fund would go toward new parking facilities and renovat ing the structure, often referred to as “the house that Ruth built.” The city has already an nounced plans for buying an abandoned rail yard five blocks from the stadium, then leasing it to a private concern for park ing facilities for 800 cars. In addition, the city, in redevelop ing the Bronx Terminal Market, will provide for additional park ing spaces. The Mayor also outlined the following improvements in the area: ¶Arrangements to Improve traffic flow by adding addition al patrolmen and a new radio communication unit to coordin ate traffic in the area before and after a game. ¶New signs directing traffic to and from the stadium. The IND 161st Street subway sta tion has been repainted and refurbished and retained 161st Street‐Yankee Stadium Subway Station. ¶Powerful lighting has been installed in the streets sur rounding the stadium. ¶New benches; malls and colorful all‐weather arcades will be installed in the area. Also, plans for mini‐trains to take fans to and from parking areas to the stadium are being investigated. To expedite the renovation, with the approval of the legis lat??re, the Yankees would undertake and pay for the work, with the city returning the money afterward.

1138-> Housing Plan Is Approved by Jerusalem Council
JERUSALEM, Feb. 21—Jeru salem's Municipal Council to night approved the national Government's plans for exten sive new housing projects that critics fear will disfigure the scenic hills around the city and complicate negotiations for an Arab‐Israeli peace settlement. The swift and overwhelming vote was taken without debate, following a decision by the leadership of the ruling Labor Alignment to represent the council's action as a demonstra tion of national unity in the face of international objections to the plan. The projects, submitted last week by the Ministry of Hous ing, call for the construction of four housing developments in the rocky hills surrounding the city, almost entirely in ter ritory held by Jordan before the six‐day war of June, 1967. Only two abstentions in the 31‐member council marred the leadership's expectation of unanimity. Mayor Teddy Kollek, who in the past has been critical of technical aspects of the minis try's projects, tonight gave them his full endorsement, stating that he could not re main indifferent to interna tional political considerations. “It is true that we've had some differences,” Mr. Kollek told the council, “but they were technical and they are being solved. We are in complete agreement, however, that con struction must go ahead and that we cannot accept foreign advice on where and when to build.” This was an allusion to the United States State Depart ment's criticism last week that the housing projects could in terfere with an Arab‐Israeli peace settlement by changing the present status in the dis puted areas. The department was reacting to the announce ment by the Housing Minister, Zev Sharef, of his decision to perss ahead with the the plans. The Jewish population of Jerusalem has grown from 100, 000 in 1948 to 210,000 after the city's reunification in 1967, while the Arab population has risen from 60,000 to 66,000.

1144-> MISS ZUKERMAN IN FLUTE RECITAL
Lots of flutists have a fatter, rounder tone than does Eugenia Zukerman, and more of a silvery sheen, a greater range of color and dynamics, and they can play faster and more accurately. But few flutists have staged as enjoyable a recital as Miss Zukerman's debut on the Young Concert Artists Series Monday night at Town Hall. The secret lies in her musicianship, which is consummate, and her taste, which is immaculate, and her stage presence —she is a sheer pleasure to watch. Miss Zukerman phrases with freedom and has an uncanny knack of pointing each passage so that it creates a vacuum for the next. Faure's “Fantasy” and the Hindemith Sonata were both complete musical edifices with every note contributing to the total structure. Mozart's Andante in C was most warmly given, with minute awareness of detail. Spoofing Delight Poulenc's “Sonate” was the spoofing delight it should be, though perhaps its humor is a trifle, broader than Miss Zukerman's refined playing allowed it to be. Messiaen's “Le Merle Noir” was done more forcefully. In all of these works, Miss Zukerman was immeasurably aided by her accompanist, KunWoo Palk, a co‐winner of the 1971 Naumburg Award. He solved the tricky problem of playing assertively without ever overwhelming the shy flute sound. The height of the evening, however, came when Miss Zukerman was joined by her husband, Pinohas Zukerman, violin, and Michael Tree, viola, in the Beethoven Serenade in D (Op. 25). This was chamber music at its richest: responsive, intelligent, carefully worked out so that it sounded spontaneous all the way. The final accelerando was done with special alacrity, no doubt because Mr. Tree was anxious to get back to his wife, who at 6 P.M. that day had given birth to their first child, a boy.

1145-> A Selective Ban On Chemical Arms Urged by Sweden
GENEVA, March 9—Sweden recommended today that the 25‐nation disarmament conference prohibit chemical and bacteriological weapons on a sliding scale, depending upon haw deadly they are and whether their components have any peaceful use. Mrs. Alva Myrdal, the Swedish delegate, said that nerve gases and mustard gas, which she said were “supertoxic” and had no peacetime uses, and toxins should be unconditionally banned. Such chemicals as hydrogen cyanide, phosgene, tear gases and defoliants have peaceful uses as insecticides and herbicides, she said, and only their wartime applications should be prohibited. Answering complaints by delegates of nonaligned countries that virtually nothing was being accomplished on actual disarmament, James F. Leonard of the United States said that the prohibition of biological weapons, would constitute “the first true measure of disarmament this body would have negotiated.” He said that he saw “no practical prospect for early progress” on a combined treaty.

1147-> Gypsy's Past—One Memento at a Time
LOS ANGELES—The man sion on Cerrocrest Drive in Beverly Hills has no number, but then its late occupant didn't need a last name to be known, either. Gypsy Rose Lee — she started out as Rose Louise Hovick, but retained only the Rose professionally and in time became recognizable simply as Gypsy—died last April at the age of 56, and the 17‐room house where she lived alone for nearly 10 years has been unoccupied since then. Now her only son, Erik Kirkland, mindful of how his mother used to love them; has decided on an auction as a means of sharing all but a few of her possessions with the public. “I want the catalogue to be a monument to her,” Mr. Kirkland, 26, told Ward Land rigan, president of Sotheby Parke‐Bernet's new Los An geles branch, which will con duct the sale. Mr. Landrigan, who sold the Krupp diamond to the Richard Burton, will preside at the auction March 9 and 10. In the meantime, as part of his research he has been busy reading everything he can about Miss Lee as well as the books and stories written by the striptease art ist, actress, author, sports woman, painter, sewing and gardening buff and television personality. On the block will go the contents of the house, which was Italian Renaissance on the outside (Miss Lee used to refer to its as “early Gloria Swanson”) and Victorian on the inside. There are velvet chairs upholstered in old Pullman‐car green, satin pil lows embroidered with pea cocks, peacock fans, antima cassars, a vintage Victrola, and a dressmaker's dummy in those measurements that she made famous languorous ly disrobing down to her G string on stage. “Mother bought the house 10 years ago,” Mr. Kirkland recalled recently, “and it was such a wreck nobody would look at it. It took her two years to get it into shape.” “Gardening is the real rea son mother moved to Cali fornia,” continued Mr. Kirk land, who is a story editor and casting director in the New York office of Otto Preminger, the producer. Earlier this month it became publicly known that Mr. Preminger is Mr. Kirkland's father, a fact Mr. Kirkland had known for nine years. Mr. Kirkland, whose surname is that of Alexander Kirkland, Miss Lee's second husband, has said that he plans to change., his name to Premin ger. Talking about his mother's decision to leave her 26‐room town house on New York's 63d Street and move to the West Coast, Mr. Kirkland remembered how she had “struggled for five years to get a garden growing at the New York house only to have a die every winter.” “The cycle of death de pressed her, so she moved into the sunshine,” he said. One of Miss Lee's weak nesses was wicker. She had it on daybeds, chests and tables, but her catholicity of taste surfaced in London once When she purchased three‐tiered table of papier maché circa 1860. The piece has a Windsor Castle scene in mother of pearl on the bottom tier and gilt flowers on the upper tiers the twin to it is in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. “Mother bought that table and her fabled Rolls‐Royce [also to be auctioned] on a trip we took to Europe after ‘Gypsy’ opened in 1958 and was a hit on the stage,” Mr. Kirkland said. “She never had treated herself to anything much be lore then. She had such haunting memories of the Depression. But Gypsy's success assured her of a steady and comfortable in come—without working—for the rest of her life.” Mr. Landrigan of Sotheby's said he was surprised when lie first walked into Miss Lee's house with his apprais er. “I hadn't pictured Gypsy as the Victorian lady she so obviously was,” he said. “She collected with great imagina tion and taste things like parasols [one belonged to Sarah Bernhardt], Victorian iron shoes, iron monkeys and curiosities, like keys from famous hotels of the world.” Her china was English, a modern adaptation of a pat tern dating back to the late 18th century called “The Blind Earl. It was in con stant use. “Mother nevi served a catered dinner in her life,” Mr. Kirkland said. “She felt catered food would be an insult to her friends. She loved to cook for people, things like beef Bourguionne, tarragon chicken, with every thing seasoned from herbs she grew in the yard just outside the kitchen and din ing room.” She was as talented with needle and thread as she was in her brief but memor able career as a stripteaser (she once estimated that she actually spent only 50 weeks as a stripper). While she lived in New York she be longed to the Golden Thimble club and used to hold quilt ing bees with Hedda Hop per, the Hollywood gossip columnist, and Imogene Co ca, the comedian. One of the spots of honor in her living room here was reserved for a “wonderful if unplayable” old harp that she took in lieu of payment from the management of a road show “Three Penny Opera” when there was no money for her salary. The public may suffer few disappointments at the auction. None of Gypsy's fabled jeweled G‐strings will be offered. Nobody seems to know what hap pened to them, although there is a suspicion that she ripped them apart and used the beads and jewels on her homemade evening gowns. But several of her needle point pieces will fall under Mr. Landrigan's gavel. And so will the famous sketch by Vertes for Vogue magazine in 1935 showing her typing away on one of her three books. The sketch where she is wearing nothing but one of her G‐strings.

1149-> Leader of War Study Sees No Security Threat So Far
WASHINGTON, June 23 — A former Governnient official who had over‐all responsibility for the preparation of the Pentagon's study on the Viet nam war said today that, in his view, hone of the material published so far, could endan ger the national security. But the official, Paul C. Warnke, former Assistant Sec retary of Defense for interna tional security affairs, said that there were “certain elements” of the unpublished portions of the study that could adversely affect the national interest if “prematurely revealed,” As an example, he cited the section of the 47‐volume study that concerns the secret dip lomatic initiatives taken during the Administration of Presi dent Lyndon B. Johnson. “I'd hate to see that pub lished,” Mr. Warnke said to reporters who met with him for an on‐the‐record breakfast interview at the National Press Club. The New York Times, in its initial report on the Pentagon study published on June 13, stated that this volume was missing from the copy made available to it. Although he is an outspoken critic of the war, Mr. Warnke today deplored the unauthorized release and publication of the Pentagon study. The release of top‐secret documents, he said, could set a “very mischievous prec edent” that could have a dam aging impact on dealings with in the Government and with other governments. As Assistant Defense Sec retary and head of the office of Internal Security ?? from August, 1967, Mr. ?? Indirectly supervised the Preparation of the ?? report. It was put together over 18 months by what he described as a “pick‐up team of 35 or 36” military and civilian specialists under the direct supervision of Leslie H. Gelb, who was an aide to Mr. Warnke. The report was completed in the fall of 1968 and trans mitted to Mr. Warnke, who was the senior official to “sign off” on it. This means he acknowledged completion of the work without endorsing it and forwarded it to the then Sec retary of Defense, Clark M. Clifford. In deploring the publication of the study, Mr. Warnke said that the man who leaked the documents “violated not only a law, but a trust.” “If we cannot count on that trust being respected,” he said, “then the conversations and de bates on major issues within the Government will be severely restricted.” Mr. Warnke said that Robert S. McNamara, th former De fense Secretary, who commis sioned the study in 1967, had intended that the report should be made public “in a relatively short period of time.” “He intended to move to have it declassified and published after the war was over,” Mr. Warnke said. “Like many of us, he hoped the war would be over by now.” On the substance of the study, Mr. Warnke said that he did not believe that a consensus had been reached within the Administration in September, 1964, to begin the bombing of North Vietnam. “There can be no general consensus until the President has joined it,” he said. “I've seen nothing in the documents ?? wrong.” Furthermore, Mr. Warnke de nied that there had been a de liberate effort to deceive or mislead the American people about the steps being taken in 1964 and 1965. If the Administration was less forthcoming than it might have been about its intentions to pursue the war, he said, it was because of a fear of pro yoking the Chinese. “There was no conspiracy to deceive,” he said.

Fifth Avenue Coach Lines, Inc., advised its stockholders yesterday that 1970 net in come had been revised upward by $378,000, or 43 cents a, share as a result of an adjust ment by the auditors Ernst & Ernst. S. Hazard Gillespie trus tee‐receiver sent a revised statement to stockholders that placed net income at $594,223, or 68 cents a share, compared with $216,223, or 25 cents a share, as reported on June 4. Mr. Gillespie said in the letter that Ernst & Ernst had advised him that “upon reconsideration they recommend that the con solidated statements of income and retained‐earnings deficit be adjusted to reclassify the charge for applicable New York State franchise tax from gen eral and administrative ex penses to retained‐earnings deficit. This chalige has no effect on the balance sheets of the company nor on the stock holders equity as set forth in the balance sheets.” Mr. Gillespie added that there would be no change in Federal or state taxes.

1152-> Jewish Woman in Odessa Trial Denies She Engaged in Slander
MOSCOW, June 23 — Reiza Palatnik, a Jewish woman on trial in Odessa on charges of “planning to slander the Soviet Union,” has pleaded not guilty and has told the court she is being persecuted for wanting to emigrate to Israel, reliable sources said today. The sources said that Mrs. Palatnik's trial in the Odessa provincial court began yester day. There has been no report of it in official Soviet news media. She is said to be charged with possessing petitions by Soviet Jews protesting official policy and with planning to dis seminate them. According to the sources, Mrs. Palatnik, a librarian, said she had the material for pro fessional reasons. Under Soviet law, it is a crime to utter or spread any comments judged by authorities to be slanderous of the Soviet Union, and anyone found guilty faces up to three years in a prison camp. Soviet law also makes the planning of an of fense a crime. Meanwhile In Kishinev, the capital of Soviet Moldavia, the trial of nine Jews charged with anti‐Soviet acts and with being linked to an alleged plan and discussion in Leningrad to hi jack a plane, completed its third day, with one of the defend ants, Gilel Shur, continuing to avow his innocence. According to reliable sources, Mr. Shur has threatened to stage a hunger strike. The sources said Mr. Shur was promised he would be released after the trial if he joined the others in accepting some of the guilt, but he refused. The official Tass account, distributed to foreign news or ganizations, said most of the defendants “are implicated in some degree or other” in plans to hijack a plane. A witness today was Gilya Butman, who received a 10‐ year prison‐camp sentence in Leningrad court last month for having played a leading role in earlier plans to hijack a plane. Mr. Butman was not in volved in the apparent decision by 12 perosns, 10 of them Jews to hijack a plane from Lenin grad on June 15, 1971. The Tass accounts have sought to implicate others on trial in Leningrad, Riga and Kishinev with hijacking plans, but published evidence indi cates that most defendants had only discussed such plans. For instance, Tass quoted Anatoly Goldfeld, a defendant in Kishinev, as having said that he had not agreed to take part in a hijacking but was aware of the plans and did nothing to thwart them.

1153-> AMEX AND O‐T‐C DECLINE SHARPLY
The American Stock Exchange and the over‐the‐counter market took a beating yesterday as both lists declined sharply in moderate trading. On the Amex, the exchange's price index dropped 0.23 to 23.55, its lowest closing price since Jan. 15, when the indicator ended at 23.52. In counter trading, the NASDAQ industrial index tumbled 1.81 to finish at 100.14. It was the fourth consecutive decline for both indicators. Turnover on the exchange expanded to 3,464,000 shares from 3,197,440 on Friday. Nine blocks of 10,000 shares or more were traded yesterday, against 10 blocks on Friday. Declines outnumbered advances by almost a 4‐to‐l ratio on the exchange, as only 183 stocks rose and 707 fell. A total of 155 issues made new 1971 lows while no stock made a high. In the counter market, of 2,809 NASDAQ issues traded, 1,235 fell; 236 rose, and 1,338 were unchanged. Oll Issues Weak Most of the land‐developer stocks on the exchange lost ground. Presley Development fell 3⅛ to 47⅜; Development Corporation of ‐America gave up 1⅛ to 26⅛; Punta Gorda Isles dropped 1½ to 17¾, and Perini slid ¾ to 4⅝. The most actively traded issue was Asamera Oil, which declined 1 point to 11 ½ on a turnover of 64,600 shares, paced by ‘a block of 12,300 shares at 12½. Most of the other oil issues fell. Creole Petroleum was down 1¾ to 23⅛; Dome Petroleum sliped 2½ to 26; Tesoro Petroleum warrants declined 2¾ to 18¾, and Scurry‐Rainbow faltered ⅞ to 12. Turnover in the counter market rose to 6.512,000 shares from 6,109,000 on Friday The S.E.C, said its suspension of exchange and counter trading in the securities of FAS International, Inc., ended at the close of business yesterday. The New York Stock Exchange, however, has announced it will continue its suspension of FAS and will apply for its delisting. The S.E.C. suspended trading in FAS on May 27. In an unrelated development, FAS said it intended not to meet interest payments on its S16,341,000 principal amount of 5 per cent convertible subordinated debentures due Jan. 1, 1972. The exchange of the subordinated debentures for stock is the first step in a recently announced FAS program of recapitalization to restore a posi tive stockholders’ equity for the company, the concern said. A number of counter issues had large losses yesterday. National Patent tumbled 5¾ Tampax dropped 5; Hughes Supply eased 4; Baumritter was down 3¾; Seven‐Up eased 3½; Coca Cola Bottlers of Los Angeles slipped 2¼; Anheuser Busch was down 1⅝; Playboy Enterprises dipped 1⅜; Amencan Express dropped 1¼, and Texfi and Kaiser Steel each were off a point.

1154-> Stage: Peasant Woe and Earthy Faith
When an Israeli musical comes to Manhattan under the patronage of the Premier of Israel Mrs. Golda Meir you would need to be some kind of an Arab—some kind of a brave Arab—to object Yet “Only Fools Are Sad,” which opened last night at the Edison Theater is endearing and happy—a gentle celebration of the joy and pain of being a man. You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy it—but no one could tell you with honesty that a touch of Jewish blood wouldn't help It might for example help you to clap in time at the curtain call It might help you see the joke about the difference between the citron and the lemon. But whichever way you look at it, “Only Fools Are Sad” is a gently fun show, full of folkspun wisdom of the small village and the good rabbi (who has ever heard of a big village or a bad rabbi—only in New York perhaps?) and songs full of Hassidic fervor. The musical was first produced in Tel Aviv in Hebrew, and its purpose was to keep alive in Israel the Hassidic tradition of Europe. The Hassidic movement was founded in the 18th century by the spiritual leader Israel ben Eliezer, later known as Ba'al Shem Tov. ?? The religious influence of his sect, which stressed joy, simplicity and hon esty and interestingly paralleled the prevailing anticlericism of certain contemporaneous Christian cults spread all over Eatern Europe. Rabbi Ba'al Shem Tov once said: “God need sno synagogue except in the heart,” and this simple message immediately spoke to the hearts of his oppressed people. Music and singing and the telling of stories that stressed the purity of faith were the characteristics of a sect that while recognizing poverty, did not approve of suffering It was always felt that a good Jew could fight back even against God. It is from these themes that the Israeli playwright Dan Almagor has put together a show that has some relationship to the “Jacques Brel Show” and, particularly in its staging by Yossi Yzraely to the Paul Sills “Story Theater,” even to “Hair,” even to books of European‐Jewish wisdom and tradition such as Leo Rosten5s invaluable “The Joys of Yiddish.” So here is a young Israel looking back to the wilderness, remembering the waters of Babylon, having reached Jerusalem. It is beautifully staged and touching in its reminiscences of piety poverty and times past. The music has been arranged from Hassidic sources by the Budapest‐born Israeli composer Yohanan Zari and given a rather new sound suitable for the young and yet recalling the old And it is performed by six most talented people—three men and and three wcmen—with six guitars a few simple props and a great deal of imagination. Is there any irony in the fact that once a generation or less ago Jews in Eastern Europe sat down and sang traditional songs from Israel. Now in Israel there are European immigrants sitting down and singing the same songs —even with a fresher beat—and telling the same stories of peasant woe and holy faith. And this they bring to New York. So go and enjoy.

1155-> Paint Brush Worker Kills Five Employes At Baltimore Plant
BALTIMORE, Nov. 22 (AP) —An employe of a paint brush factory in southwest Baltimore opened fire inside the plant this afternoon, killing five co‐workers and wounding a sixth and a policeman before being critically wounded by the police. The police said that the gunman, who carried two rifles and wore military fatigues, “went from building to building and shot everyone he saw.” The gunman was identified by the police as Raymond D. Ferrell‐el, 30 years old, of Baltimore, and said he had worked at the PPG Industries, Inc., plant for the last six months. The police said that Mr. Ferrell‐el had not shown up today for his job, which involved dipping paint brush handles in lacquer. Four of the workers, all men, died at the plant. The fifth victim was dead on, arrival at St. Agnes Hospital. The five workers killed were identified by the police as Alien Ringley, 32; William Cooke Sr., 35, and Martin Gilbert, 19, all of Baltimore; Edward Yienger, 35, of Glen Burnie, Md., and Vernon Ferguson, 25, of Baltimore. A sixth worker, Robert Lock, also of Baltimore, was in critical condition with bullet wounds in the thigh and chest. Mr. ?? was listed in critical condition at the hospital, where he underwent surgery for treatment of bullet wounds of the lower body. Patrolman Kenneth Hayden, 24, the first policeman to arrive at the plant, was wounded in the left knee in an exchange of gunfire with the assailant, The paint brush factory is comprised of four buildings and employs 230 workers. Arthur W, Ricker, a plant executive, said the shooting broke out shortly before 3 P.M Russell L. Smith, general manager of the plant, said he heard the gunfire and was on his way to the second floor to investigate when a wounded worker fell down the stairs into his arms. He pulled him from the stairwell. “I can think of no conceivable motive for this,” Mr. Smith ad ded.

1156-> Japan Slows Down —To 11% Growth
TOKYO—Japan is expect ing a leveling‐off this year in its growth rate after a five‐ year economic boom, but even if the predicted slowdown occurs, it will still leave the country with a rate higher than that of any Western country. Such a decline would mean a drop from the 13 per cent annual growth rate in the last five years to a still‐robust 11 to 12 per cent. Analysts cite the following factors in the expected mod erate slowdown: ¶An expected leveling‐off In the rate of capital, invest ment, which accounts for 20 per cent of the gross na tional product. ¶A drop in the rate of in crease in exports. ¶A decline in demand for consumer durables such as automobile and household ap pliances, with the domestic market apparently saturated at this time. Analysts believe that a major economic challenge facing Japan this year is the readjustment of her industrial structure without producing adverse effects upon her economy. Consumer spending, which accounts for nearly 50 per cent of the gross national product, rose by 17.4 per cent last year over 1960, a per formance that few expect to be matched. Last year, Expo '70 in Osaka drew 64 million visitors from here and abroad, contributing considerably to the increase of consumer spending. A survey by the Sanwa Bank put direct and indirect demand caused by the open ing of the world exposition at $9.2‐billion, compared with $7.5‐billion for the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964. Of the total demand, the con struction of the exposition's site, roads and other facilities amounted to $3.75‐billion and consumer spending reached $950‐million. Wages advanced last year by 18 per cent over 1969 and department store sales soared 20 per cent to a postwar high of $960‐million. “The people of Japan are living a considerably rich life materialistically today due to the remarkable expansion of the national economy,” the 1970 White Paper released by the country's economic plan ning agency said. The per‐capita annual in come in Japan, which was $473 in 1960, or 23d in the world ranking, had increased to $1,503 by 1970, advancing to 14th in the world, an esti mate by the Japan Life In surance Company said. Refrigerators, washing ma chines and other electric ap pliances now constitute an integral part of the daily life of the Japanese people, even in the low‐income bracket, a survey by the Prime Min ister's office showed. The life of the people is becoming more and more linked to foreign trade as a result of the increasing trans portation of food, whose ship ments to Japan amounted to $214‐million in 1969, or a rise of 14 per cent over the pre vious year. The importation of food is thought to have risen by 18 per cent last year over 1969. The country's gold and foreign exchange reserves continued to climb, exceeding $4‐billion at the end of last year, a gain of $700‐million over 1969. Major factors responsible for the sharp rise were a sizable surplus in foreign trade and the inflow of foreign currencies for investments and high interest rates. Government and banking circles fear that Japan will come under greater pressure from Western countries for an upward revaluation of the yen if the growing inflow of foreign currencies continues at the present pace. Exports, a big factor in Japan's growth, went up 21 per cent to $17‐billion in the first 11 months of 1970 over the corresponding period of the preceding year. Although shipments to the United States, the biggest market for Japanese com modities, suffered a serious blow from American meas ures taken against the Japanese merchandise, efforts made by traders and manu facturers to diversify their export markets resulted in a sharp increase in exports to Europe and Communist coun tries, offsetting the drop in shipments to the United States. Exports to European coun tries rose 50.8 per cent to $1.8‐billion in the first eight months of 1970 over the same period of the preceding year, while shipments to Commu nist China increased to $489‐ million in the first 10 months. The country's two‐way trade with Peking was put at $800‐ million last year, a gain of 30 per cent over 1969. Continued wage raises, the growing burden of personnel expenditures and require ments for measures to prevent environmental disruptions brought about a decline in corporate earnings for the semi‐annual business period ended last Sept. 30. The slowdown in exports to the United States and a de cline in demand for consumer durables in the domestic market has forced the manu facturers of such export related industries as iron and steel, automobiles, electric ap pliances and synthetic fibers to reduce their production and investment programs.

1157-> Webster ‘Strong Finish’ Plan Gets Test in Giants’ Final Games
Aside from regrets the thought appropriate to New York Giant fans yesterday in the wake of Sunday's 17‐13 loss at Pittsburgh was: “What can the remaining four games prove?” A victory at Pittsburgh would have kept alive a hope, however slim, for a playoff berth. With a 4.6 won‐lost record that can become no better than 8‐6, however even far‐out speculation isn't worth the effort. But there remains something quite significant to be proved, if one is willing to look below the unyielding surface of final scores. A serious test of Coach Webster's philosophy is shaping up and its outcome could have an effect on the Giants in the future. It is no secret that Webster ran a purposely “easy” training camp on the theory that in long season he would rather have his men mentally and physically at their peak late instead of early. And it is no secret that not all members of the Giant “family” agreed with that philosophy. In fact Alex has been second‐guessed about it all along sometimes to his face. As things turned out it didn't really matter in the league standing. The Giants lost too many games too early to make a run for anything and the injury that hurt them most—to Ron Johnson's leg—couldn't be attributed to the training program because it was suffered before training began. But the principle involved is important, since in another year the Giants may be in contention, going into the last four games. If and when, the question is should they arrive at that point by the road Webster took this year or by the opposite one? At the moment, the case looks strong for Webster's approach. In the last four games the Giants have played infinitely better than before and even in the frustrating Pittsburgh defeat they were clearly hitting and trying harder. In those four games the Giants outplayed Minnesota San Diego Atlanta and Pittsburgh even though they won only the middle two. Over that stretch despite fresh injuries and costly fumbles they controlled the ball 57 per cent of the time and outgained the opposition, 1,406 yards to 991. Most pertinent of all is the fact that the Giants improved at exactly the moment a total collapse would have surprised no one—after a beating by Baltimore that made their record 2‐4. At the same time the most publicized fast‐start team Washington has bogged down Giant fans who were holding up George Allen's methods as a model for all to follow may yet develop second thoughts. So far however, this situation is only the beginning of a trend. To prove Webster right the Giants must play well against St. Louis Washington Dallas and Philadelphia; if they don't the main prop of Alex's argument will disappear.

1158-> A Discussion
What's the outlook for our immediate area right now? The territories that manufacture for export on a large scale — Hong Kong and Taiwan — are doing better than Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, which depend more on the export of primary products. In 1970 we (Hong Kong) had a trade growth of 14 per cent, to a total value of roughly $2‐billion. Our exports have increased more than 10 times in the last 10 years. We continue to grow in the financial sphere. We had a record year in tourism — 930,000 tourists in 1970. The area as a whole can expect continued growth, but its scope will depend on the well‐being of the Western world, particularly the United States, and Japan. Hong Kong sells 40 per cent of its exports to the United States. I think Hong Kong is set fair. You've got more in vestment bankers constantly setting up business. A well‐known London com pany recently got approval for listing its shares on the Hong Kong Exchange. A new Japanese investment is a contain er terminal here—a direct capital invest ment that is not going to show a com mercial return for some time. They must feel confident about the future. What about the other countries of the region? Taiwan is having some of the problems we are having here in Hong Kong, The shortage of labor is be coming chronic. The Taiwan Government is becoming more liberal, trying to copy Hong Kong. We see a lot of business that used to come to Hong Kong going to Taiwan. I have just made a trip to Taiwan, and it is interesting to note that they are working very hard on the reform of laws and regulations. This is largely a measure of the initia tive and aggressiveness of the new Min ister of Finance, K. T. Li. American in vestment continues to grow; certainly American businessmen are not going into a place unless they can see stability ahead. Hong Kong has achieved more than the other countries in this area by building up invisible earnings, principally financial and serv ice industries. I don't think any other country provides the same degree of financial service. This has helped Hong Kong enormously in international terms. Singapore is trying to become a competitor in that connec tion. It might well become so, but I don't think of that as an unfavorable. factor for Hong Kong. We don't want free trade or free enterprise es a monopoly of Hong Kong. We want this principle to prevail throughout the world. Turning to Taiwan again, I believe development there is in that direction. The authorities have established what they call an export processing zone in Kaohsiung. That creates the free‐trade atmosphere Hong Kong represents. The zone has been such a great success that they are going ahead with a second zone north of Kaohsiung. I believe Korea is doing something along the same line. You've got to break Southeast Asia down, as the out look varies country by country. Singa pore obviously is one area people are looking at favorably. There are other areas that are less attractive. I think Indonesia will come along the same way as Malaysia and Singapore, but it will take quite a while, Indonesia is one of the richest countries in the world; the problems are mostly political. Malaysia's econo my rests on a very narrow base—his torically, rubber and tin. Rubber prices have come under pressure from synthe tics. Tin has a broader market. Major investment to promote those industries has been foreign money, which still has confidence fundamentally. Many of the rubber plantations are shifting to palm oil. As far as industrialization is con cerned, they have a long way to go. They have other natural resources, such as timber. But they have a long way to go there, too. Bad publicity for the Philippines has been very unfortunate. I have talked with businessmen coming back from there, and they are quite encouraged. It is a country having prob lems educating its youth, and there are economic imbalances in its society, but it's a rich country, and I think with responsible leadership it will pull through. It has been the United States's baby, and if it doesn't pull through it's a reflection on our tutelage. If the war would come to en end, I think there would be a very fast growth in Indochina. There's no doubt about it. There again is a land quite rich in resources. I think Thailand has a good outlook, but it is obviously affected by the unsettled conditions in Vietnam, Cambodia and so on. To shift the focus a little, what about the repeated com plaint of the developing countries that they get too little for their primary products to pay for the capital goods they need? It is not a ques tion of earning enough; it is a question of administration, plus education, espe cially technical education. The ground rules need to be fixed in such a way that a country is attractive to overseas investors. I have attended several conferences of the United Nations Econ omic Commission for Asia and the Far East, and the same thing has been said time and again—that a developing coun try tries very hard to get ahead, only to find it is earning too little to indus trialize. Some improvement may result from the generalized preference clause being proposed by the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development, for undeveloped countries by the in dustrialized nations. The scheme will certainly help countries in this area, but what it will do to Hong Kong is causing us lots of worry. What are the prospects for Communist China's trade relations? I think they are try ing to push exports, from the evidence of the two Canton Trade Fairs this year, which I understand account for 50 per cent of their foreign trade contracts. The total this year was about the same as last year, but the goods ware more varied and the quality was upgraded. Their trade has shown a very gradual increase in recent years. Their total foreign trade, say $4‐billion a year, is considerably less than the foreign trade of Hong Kong — four million people competing with 700 million. Taiwan has more than $3‐billion a year. I think some countries are over‐optimistic about trade opportunities in China. I know we are buying a tremendous amount from China, and our trade is really one way. We export very little to China. I see in the future Hong Kong becoming once again an entrepot for trade to China and Chinese trade with the outside world. One of the basic points is that the atmosphere for trade with China has definitely improved in the last six months to a year. Undoubt ly it will take time to translate that atmosphere into increased business. I don't think people should be carried away. I think China should be recognized as soon as possible, because you can't ignore the 700 million people there. Since Canada and Italy have recognized China I think more coun tries will follow, or be pushed into situation where they have to recognize eventually. I argue against this theme that you can't ignore 700 million people. I haven't read the Charter of the United Nations recently, but it does call for some standards that members should meet. In view of China's actions in Vietnam. Laos, Tibet and Korea, I don't know if they are fit members of the club. Over 70 per cent of the Unted Nations members will put China in, and America would have to say, “I pull out because I don't agree.” Recognizing China doesn't necessarily mean that you'll develop trade with China. Some countries that have recognized China suddenly find they are increasing trade by a large percentage, but a number of those countries find themselves in the commercial wilderness, for one reason or another. You get temporary honey moon periods, as when de Gaulle rec ognized Peking, but now the French compete on a strictly commercial basis with everybody else. How would you rank this region as a field for investment? I would rate it very high. There is a tremendous poten tial for development, with natural re sources and a large number of people whose standard of living and purchasing power are increasing. Leaving aside China, there are still a lot of people. Most of those, people are coming from behind in many ways, when compared with the West. Many of the countries provide incentives for overseas invest ment. Political instability is a risk, but there are many areas outside this part of the world where you are taking a political risk, which has to be related to your commercial risk.

1160-> Thousands Visit Kennedy's Grave
ARLINGTON, Va., Nov. 22 (AP)—Thousands of people climbed a grassy, windswept hillside today to pay tribute to John Fitzgerald Kennedy on the eighth anniversary of his assassination. Leading the procession through acres of small white markers was Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who arrived at Arlington National Cemetery in the early morning hours, coatless, solemn and alone. For a quarter hour the Massachusetts Democrat stood before his brother's grave, shiverinig in the November chill, arms folded, head bowed. Then, making the Sign of the cross, he knelt and placed a single white carnation on the stone. Then, stepping away, he walked to the grave of his brother Robert F., also a victim of an assassin's bullet. Here, Senator Kennedy placed a small white rosebud. Another early visitor was the President's mother‐in‐law, Mrs. Hugh. Auchincloss, accompanied by her 24‐year‐old son, James, who said he thought his half‐sister, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, was in New York. Traditionally, Mrs. Onassis remains in seclusion with her children on the anniversary of her first husband's death.

1161-> PIANO RECITAL GIVEN BY LUCY ISHKANIAN
Lucy Ishkanian played the piano powerfully and at times quite well in her first New York recital yesterday afternoon at Philharmonic Hall A native New Yorker of Armenian descent Miss Ishkanian studied for 15 years at the Juilliard School and competed in the 1962 Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow She was not therefore a debutante in the usual sense, and her performances often reflected her experience. Miss Ishkanian's technique was impressive, but erratic. Her approach to the piano was almost invariably to try to overpower it. This made something of a hash out of parts of the Brahms Sonata No. 2 (Op.2), and made the first New York performance of Khatchaturian's Sonata (1961) hard on the ears. The Khatchaturian is a dreadful piece but the pianist's unvaried banging maximized its insipid ugliness. Miss Ishkanian made more sense out of Hovhaness's “Yenovk the Troubadour” Suite. And she gave Mozart's Sonata in C (K.330) a generally tidy performance, though one that entirely dispensed with repeats. Three Chopin pieces—the Nocturne in F the Impromptu in A flat and the Ballade in G minor —underlined Miss Ishkanian's technical abilities as well as her current problems. She tended to speed up overpedal and pound the piano when in trouble, intent too often on pulling off the pointless sensation rather than playing the music. DONAL HENAHAN.

1162-> RICHNESS OF GAMBAS INFUSES A CONCERT
Contemporary music for viola da gamba is a pretty sparse commodity, but the Baroque Trio of the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis (August Wenzinger and Hannelore Mueller, gambas, Robert Conant, harpsichord) offered three specially commissioned examples Sunday night at the New York Cultural Center. The two Swiss works, Joseph Haselbach's rather overdrawn dialogue “Mironton” for two gambas and Rudolf Kelterborn's texturally intriguing trio, “Inventions and Intermezzi,” were carefully conceived to exploit the expressive potential of these traditionally shy instruments. David Loeb's conversational “Fantasia e due Scherzi” (a premiere) pitched the two gambas on a slightly higher scale of intensity but with equally effective results. Brian Fennelly's ‘scampering harpschord fantasy, “Tesserae” (also a premiere), provided Mr. Conant with an impressive solo virtuoso study. Framing the contemporary items were a suite by Forqueray and a trio sonata by Gratin two minor but diverting classic composers. Each performance could hardly have been bettered for scrupulous taste technical lucidity and complete musical absorption. PETER G. DAVIS.

To the Editor: Would it not be wise for the City of New York to contract with a selfliquidating agency to tow cars that have received tickets for illegal parking? This agency could be in intercom contact with meter maids, who would report license number, car and location for pickup. The agency could get $25 of the $50 towing charge. On such a basis, just think of how many policemen could be released to cope with the problems that only policemen should handle. ALEX J. WEINSTEIN Peekskill, N. Y., March 31, 1971

The city Building Inspectors Union voted overwhelmingly last night to reject an impasse panel's recommendations to end. a 19‐month‐old contract dispute with the ‘city. When the vote became known, William J. Glinsman, president of the 1,200‐man Local 211 of the Allied Building Inspectors Union, demanded that the city negotiate with them and posed the threat of strike that could tie up millions of dollars worth of construction and the city's daily garbage removal. The local is an affiliate of the International Union of Operating Engineers, whose members operate cranes and bulldozers at construction sites and city incinerators. The men in Mr. Glinsman's local inspect elevators, boilers, building and construction for the city's Housing and Development Admiinstration. The vote, at the New Yorker Hotel, was 406 to 161 for rejection. A decision on a possible strike is to be made by the union's 16‐man executive board. The panel's recommendations were for a 2½‐year pact from Jan. 1, 1970, to June 30, 1972, with an average salary rise from $8,300 to $9,500.

1167-> Roundup: Powell and Orioles Roll On
After a whiter of fishing off the Florida coast, hitting fungoes to a junior college baseball team and speaking at dinners that featured curdled gravy, John Wesley (Boog) Powell is tilting seismographs again in the American League. Yesterday, he hit a home run with two men on base to stake the Baltimore Orioles to a 3.0 lead over the Cleveland Indians, whom they eventually defeated in 10 innings, 6‐4. The day before, he hit a home run with one man on base to stake Baltimore to a 2‐0 lead and the Orioles’ went on to take that one, 3‐0. But if there is one attribute of Boog Powell that is buried ‘in statistical data, it is his endurance. He rarely takes a day off and rarely visits the training room. In nine seasons as an Oriole, he has averaged 140 games a year. Along Chesapeake Bay; he is as much a fixture as the sea gulls and the ‐fog. “I get just as tired as everyone else late in the season,” he said. “But what's the alternative? Not play and sleep? No, I play when I'm tired and I play when I don't feel like playing because I've got a job to do. Even during the winter, I force myself to work out. I run, and I grit my teeth a lot.” Last winter, after being voted the Most Valuable Player in the American League, Powell's speaking schedule cut into his sprinting one. But he did practice occasionally with the MiamiDade South Junior College team and took long walks along fishing piers and inside airport terminals, enroute to and from dinner dates. Like winners of Oscars and Heisman Trophies, he said most valuable players have a limited time in which to capitalize on their distinctions. “I've never totaled it up, in dollars and cents, but the M.V.P. award is worth some money,” said Powell. “The two big sources, of course, are fees for speaking engagements and commercial endorsements. But I don't look upon the award from strictly a money standpoint. It's still the most prestigious award in the game, as far as the players are concerned, and I'd sure as heck like to win it again.” Powell not only hit a home run yesterday, but he hit a single and wound up with four runs batted in. He and Paul Blair both drew walks with the bases loaded in the 10th inning to force in the winning runs. Jim Palmer, with relief help from Ed Watt, won his second straight game, retiring 23 straight batters at one point. Gram Nettles‐hit a home run and a double for Cleveland. AMERICAN LEAGUE Milwaukee at Chicago—Skip Lockwood held the White Sox to four hits as the Brewers scored a 4‐1 victory. Dave May had two hits for Milwaukee, a single and a double. Rich McKinney had two singles to account for half of the White Sox's safeties. Oakland at Minnesota—For the second straight day, Reggie Jackson led the Athletics to a victory over the Twins, this time by a 4.3 margin. He hit a single with two out in the eighth inning to drive home Joe Rudi with the decisive run. Don Mincher hit a home run earlier in the game for Oakland. California at Kansas City—Sandy Alomar and Jim Fregosi singled with two out in the 11th inning to drive in three runs and earn the Angels a 5‐2 triumph over the Royals. NATIONAL. LEAGUE Houston at San Francisco —Fran Healy, in his first time at bat in the National League, hit a home run to give the Giants a 4.3 triumph over the Astros. Healy, who played briefly in 1969 for the Kansas City Royals, hit the first pitch thrown to him over the right field screen in the last of the 10th inning to break r 3‐3 tie. Bobby Bonds also hit a home run for San Francisco. Chicago at San Diego—Joe Pepitone had four hits to lead the Cubs to a 4.3 victory over the Padres. Bill Hands won his first game in three starts, allowing eight hits. Pepitone and Ron Santo each drove in two runs to account for the Chicago scoring. St. Louis at Los Angeles—Bill Russell's double and Maury _Wills's single in the bottom of the ninth gave the Dodgers a 2‐1 victory over the Cardinals. Al Downing, making his first start in the National League after a decade in the American, was the winning pitcher.

1168-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: I. W. Abel of the United Steelworkers is caught in a vise. Surely Its knows that wage increases for his rank and file that outstrip productivity will only lead to further increases in imports, with a corresponding drop in domestic production. This, ironically, would reduce employment for steelworkers in this country. He is equally aware that were he not to press for a substantial wage increase the membership would turn him out in favor of someone who ??. The democratic nature of labor unions in all quadrants is beginning to manifest itself in the sophisticated use of raw power to the significant disadvantage of the entire country. This inordinate power was vested in organized labor by the Congress. It remains then for Congress to reduce this power quickly and surely, being careful to avoid favoring management that is equally capable of abusing an excess of power. ROBERT N. SILLARS ??

1169-> Armand Denis, Author, Is Dead; Produced TV Films on Animals
NAIROBI, Kenya, April 15—Armand Denis, the television film director and author, died today at his country home 12 miles from here after a Iong illness. He was 74 years old. Mr. Denis and his wife, Michaels, who became his assistant director after they were married, made 105 half‐hour television color films, dealing mainly With African wildlife. They were shown throughout the world. In 1954 Mr. and Mrs. Denis received the award for the best television documentary of the year for their “Filming in Africa” series. Mr. Denis made “Savage Splendor,” the first full‐length color film to be produced in Africa, and he was technical adviser for “King Solomon's Mines.” Mr. Denis, the son of a Belgian judge, was born in Brussels and went to England as a refugee from World War I. He took a degree in chemistry at Oxford University, and emigrated to the United States and became a citizen. Beginning a career in chemical research as a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology, where his interests included radio, Mr. Denis helped to invent a device for automatic volume control. Then, through his interest in photography, he turned to filming animals. Mr. Denis published his autobiography, “On Safari,” in 1963. In it he told of how he once was a novice monk; helped Dr. Maria Stopes translate a paper on the microstructure of Icoal, and how his interest in wildlife was first quickened while working as a chemist. His “Cats of the World,” a survey of 36 living species of cats—was published in 1964. Mr. Denis settled in Kenya and was devoted to the conservation of game, which he did much to popularize. Aided Wildlife Fund “Cats of the World” was described on its publication in 1964 as “an important book because it is the first in a series dedicated to the work of the World Wildlife Fund, an international charitable foundation for raising money to save both the world's wildlife and wild places.” In his autobiography, “On Safari: The Story of My Life,” published in 1963, Mr. Denis wrote: “I have seen things no one will ever see again. have taken the chances the world offered me and the world has been kind to me.” Orville Prescott, reviewing the book for The New York Times, called it “a readable and interesting chronicle of a life full of adventure and full of variety.” The film “Dark Rapture” was made when Mr. Denis was married to the former Lelia Roosevelt, a first cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt and a second cousin of Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Times commented that if “Dark Rapture” was not “the best film about Africa ever made, it is certainly the most beautiful and most richly documented production of its kind ever to achieve general release in this country.” While the picture was successful, the marriage was not. Mrs. Denis, who operated the Denis Roosevelt Anthropoid Ape Research Foundation at Dania, Fla., brought suit for divorce in 1948, while her husband was in Africa on one of the expeditions cited in the suit as a cause of the divorce. She charged that her husband's major interest in life was travel and jungle exploretion and that he seldom wrote, and “when he did, the letters lacked affection and contained mostly orders to carry out.”

1170-> ABEL DEFIES NIXON ON STEEL WAGE BID
PITTSBURGH, April 15 (UPI) —I. W. Abel, president of the United Steelworkers of America, said today that his union members “resent deeply” the intrusion by the Nixon Administration into the forthcoming steel contract negotiations. “When our time comes at the bargaining table, We'll prove our case and I defy anyone—including the President of the United States — to show how equity for ‘the steelworkers will be detrimental to this society of ours,” Mr. Abel said. “They [the Administration] have served notice that basic steelworkers are not entitled to the same treatment as others,” Mr. Abel told 600 dolegates at a meeting of the union's District 20, which represents 74,000 members in Pennsylvania. Referring to an “inflation alert” sounded Tuesday by the Administration, Mr. Abel said, “We have no intention of following their suggestions. We resent tha't. When you get to the bargaining table you have a right to seek the best contract.” The alert by the President's Council of Economic Advisers said that the can industry settlement with the steelworkers last month failed to halt the trend of wage increases. President Nixon asked the steelworkers to use restraint in contract talks with the basic steel industry, whose contract with the union expires Aug. 1.

1171-> Florida U. Students Mob Home Of President After Police Battle
GAINESVILLE, Fla., April 15 —A raucous crowd of 800 angry students flocked to the home of the president of the University of Florida tonight, demanding his resignation and screaming their criticism of the school's racial policy. President Stephen C. O'Connell and his family left under police escort and officers in riot helmets surrounded the Georgian mansion. The demonstration at the president's residence came at the end of a tense day on traditionally tranquil campus. At least 77 students, most of them Negroes, were arrested earlier following a sit‐in in the president's office and a rally and march by about 1,000 others that ended in a melee behind the administration building. Involved were units from the city police, the Sttae Highway Patrol and the sheriff's department, as well as the company police. University spokesmen said two policemen had been injured. Several police cars and three university buses were damaged. 68 Arrested at First The demonstrations were prompted by the suspension from the university and the subsequent arrest of 68 students who refused to leave Mr. O'Connell's office in the administration building. They had interrupted a conference between him and another student and presented list of demands from the school's Black Student Union. After their arrest by the campus police, the president of the student body, Stephen Uhlfolder, called a rally to raise funds for their bail. The rally was followed by a march to the administration building, where about 300 of the students jammed the halls outside Mr. O'Connell's office. He spoke to the crowd outside but was shouted down. The students moved to the rear of the building, where witnesses said the police attempted to disperse them by moving into the crowd with riot batons and clubs. When that tactic proved unsuccessful, tear gas was used. Nine more students were arrested. In a news conference broadcast on the school's television station, Mr. O'Connell said tonight that he would not accede to any of the black students’ demands, which included the recruitment of 500 Negroes for the 1971‐72 freshman class of 2,800 students. While he was speaking, a really at the administration building again ended in a march to his house. When he arrived from the television station, he spoke briefly to the students on the front porch, telling them that “nothing would be accomplished in such a setting” and re‐entered the house. Most of the students left after the president and his family were driven away. A small group remained through the night.

1176-> MAYOR SEES CUTS IN DRUG PROGRAM
The city's antinarcotics pro grams would be “cut to rib bons” by state budget reduc tions, Mayor Lindsay charged yesterday in a news conference at City Hall. “The state is going out of the narcotics business,” he said gravely. “That puts us back where we were four years ago.” Slapping his hand on a glass‐topped table in front of him, the Mayor frowned as he read from notes on the likely impact of the cuts in state aid that had been scrawled during a meeting of this Narcotics Con trol Council. He was joined in his cri ticism—part of an on‐going ad ministration scenario to drama tize the city's fiscal problems to the Legislature in Albany— by his Corrections and Addic tion Services Commissioners. “Total disaster,” said Graham S. Finney, the Addiction Agency head. “A public‐safety disaster,” said George F. McGrath, Com missioner of Corrections. The Mayor and his aides were unable to provide any figures on the number of ad dicts under treatment in the city. They were still trying to “pull together all the pieces” on the financial impact of the state cutbacks announced Thurs day, Mr. Lindsay said. But it appeared that some $48.2‐mil lion that the city had been hoping to get from Albany next year for various selected pro grams would be cut to $9.5‐ million. A couple of hours afterward, Jay Kriegel, the Mayor's top staff man, amended some of the numbers that had been pro vided by Mr. Lindsay and of fered an estimate of the total impact if the money cut by the state was not restored. Current city spending on narcotics control runs about $80‐million a year, he said, of which the state contributes $60‐ million. The state cuts appear to reduce that state share by two‐ thirds—to $20‐million. Major state aid for local drug pro grams was started in 1967. Mr. Lindsay said his staff would document the impact of the cuts for the leaders of the Legislature, which is now in session. Mr. Finney listed the cuts in the following main areas: ¶Under the Youthful Drug Abuse Act, the city had been expecting $35.8‐million from the state: It would get $6‐mil lion, necessitating, among other things, dismantling of the Nar cotics Control Coordinator pro grams in the 93 city high high schools. ¶The city‐run addict rehabili tation program on Harts Island, projected to cost $3.2‐million, would be “obliterated.” This is financed by the state. ¶The methadone maintenance program, budgeted to spend $9.2‐million in state money next year and to treat 9,000 addicts, would receive $3.5‐million from the state. Mr. McGrath said the state would “foist” 100 narcotics ad dicts each week on the city prison system, prisoners who are now being sent to state narcotics treatment facilities. “These are the sickest people in many ways,” he said, “We're going to be in the addiction business.” Administration officials have been dramatizing the local im pact of projected state budget cuts through some actual lay offs and a variety of gloomy forecasts as to what might hap pen in the city fiscal year start ing July 1. The Mayor has asked legisla tive approval of a tax package of $880‐million to help balance a budget, still to be made pub lic, which is expected to be in the neighborhood of $8.5‐bil lion. There is a gap” now, ac cording to Mr. Lindsay's of fice, of $1‐billion between pro jected revenues and the cost of continuing current city services.

TOKYO, Sept. 22 (AP)—Japan and the Soviet Union today signed a new five‐year trade and payments agreement, calling for an exchange of goods valued at $5.2‐billion during 1971‐75, the Foreign Ministry said. Two‐way trade volume during 1966‐70 totaled $3.3‐billion, the ministry said. The agreement did not itemize trade in terms of volume. It only specified a list of 64 items for Japan to export and 87 items for Japan to import from the Soviet Union.

1179-> Ecology and Economy
On Earth Day a year ago, Mayor Lindsay joined enthus iastically with the crowds in Union square in applauding a resolution read from the speak ers stand calling for the ban ning of autos from Manhattan in 1972. The Mayor's applause was in keeping with repeated staterents by city of ficials that the car was the ma jor source of the city's air pollu tion. This year the banning of the auto was once again the rallying point for many of the ecological fairs and exhibitions held this week, which the Mayor proclaimed as Earth Week. But the city administration's retreat from earlier plans for such a ban points up the diffi culty of translating environ mental enthusiasm into actual policy. The main difficulty, accord ing to Lindsay aides, is the slump in the economy. “During war years,” said Sid Davidoff, one of the aides, “you don't test new products for Iuxury living.” It was Mr. Davidoff who, earlier this year, was put in charge of a project aimed at banning private cars from a major part of Manhattan for a major part of the day. Originally the project was to ban private autos from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. in an area from 59th Street to 34th Street and from Second Avenue to Eighth. The area was wittled down to 56th Street to 36th and Ave nue of the Americas to Third Avenue from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. Then it went down to only Madison and Lexington Ave nues from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. What the Mayor finally an nounced was the two‐hour closing—from noon to 2 P.M.— of Madison Avenue, from 42d Street to 57th, in effect this week. Yesterday the Mayor hailed the success of the Madison Ave nue closing and said it would be continued for another week. His aides suggested that it might be continued beyond next week. Mr. David off said the inten sity of the opposition from the business community caused the Mayor to cut back the wider ban. Business leaders had convinced the Mayor, Mr. Davidoff said, that attempting such an innovation at a time of eco nomic recession would be dis astrous. According to another aide the business reaction was “hysterical.” Some evironmentalists were critical of the city's retreat on the automobile, feeling that the enthusiasm of Earth Week would turn into frustration if the city did not change some basic policy. Madison Avenue for two hour a day is nothing.” said Peter Kahn, executive director of Citizens for Clean Air. “It isn't even a crumb. The Lind say Administration, for all in tents and purposes has abon doned the environment.” Mr. Kahn disputed the idea that clean air should be con sidered a luxury. “Clean air is a luxury now because it can only be afforded by people who can get away to it,” he said. “But what about the seven and a half million other people here?” Despite the environmental ists' protest there is some question about the extent of their support. Jerome Kretchemer, the En vironmental Protection Admin strator, said there was a feek ing in the administration that while people were concerned about the invironment they were not yet willind to go so far as, say, giving up their cars. The environmentalists have not yet built themselves into a constituency that can exert as much pressure on the Mayor as businessmen, Mr. Kretchmer said. Although strollers have been enthusiastic about the closing of Madison Avenue this week, there is no plan now to extend it to other streets. Mr. Davidoff said: “We've found nothing more we can take out of the grid system now that won't mess up the traffic pattern too badly.” There is also some question of the desire of city officials to do away with the privte auto. On Thursday a group called Bike for a Better City pedaled down to City Hall and present ed the city with a bike rack. The shiny new rack stood un used in front of City Hall most of that day while all around it the cars of city officials were parked, double parked and even parked on the sidewalks.

1180-> PROTANTO, $6.80, CAPTURES STYMIE
In a three‐hourse blanket finish that had the crowd of 20,792 at Belmont Park waiting and wondering after the completion of the 1¼‐mile event, Cragwood Stable's Protanto won the 16th running of the Stymie Handicap yesterday. It was a finish reminiscent of the 1944 edition of the Carter Handicap at nearby Aqueduct. In that race, Brownie, Boussuet and Wait A Bit came home in a triple dead heat for first. Yesterday, two noses separated the first three finishers in the eight‐horse field. Second, between horses at the wire in yesterday's $33,950 fixture, was William J. Haggin Perry's Loud, while Meadowhill's Naskra, a 9‐to‐1 outsider, was third. The victory was worth $20,370 to Protanto, a $150,000 yearling purchase. Mount Rated Well Jorge Velasquez, who rode Protanto, rates his mount in superb fashion. Far Back in the backstretch, Protanto went to the front in the final strides. Velasquez said after the race: “Just when I felt we were on the lead, my horse seemed to want to pull up. I helped him change his mind.” Protanto, carrying 117 pounds, left as the $6.80‐for$2 co‐favorite with Gifford Stable's West Coast Scout. The latter, top‐weighted with 120 pounds and one of three 3‐year‐olds in the race, was factor only in the early going. The race, run in 2:02 2‐5, was started on the clubhouse turn. This was an innovation. Previous 1¼‐mile events at Belmont—at least in memory—had been started from the chute tar up the backstretch. Because the long stretch run from the chute down the backstretch was eliminated, yesterday's clocking failed to challenge Belmont's record for the distance. The regular track mark of 2:00 is held jointly by the great Kelso (1961) and. Whisk Broom II (1913). The change in the start was in keeping with the desire of Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, chairman of the New York Racing Association's board of trustees, to give fans a closer view of races. For Velasquez and Laff it Pincay Jr., who rode LOud, the view of yesterday's early developments was mostly long range. In contrast to Naskra, who was kept off the pace by Mike Venezia, Loud and Protanto were sixth and seventh, respectively, during most of the backstretch run. Protanto's success was only his second in 17 outings this year, although the son of Native Dancer had won $131,614 during 1971 before yesterday's race. His previous triumph was scored in the Whitney at Saratoga last month. A little more than two weeks ago, he finished second in the Governor behind Farewell Party after bearing out in the stretch.

1181-> Soviet Is Relaxing Its Official Attitude On Private Autos
MOSCOW, Sept. 22—The Soviet Union announced today the start of production on the second main assembly line of its Italian‐built Fiat plant and unveiled the most complete set of statistics on car output and ownership yet published in its official press. A dispatch from the new industrial city of Togliatti, on the Volga River, said that the first car had rolled off the new conveyor belt, which is one of three to be built in the plant when it reaches its full capacity of 660,000 units in the middle nineteen seventies. The construction of the Fiat plant, which went into operation in the autumn of 1970, marks a turning point in official attitudes toward private automobiles in the Soviet Union. In the Stalin era, when the emphasis was on development of the nation's heavy industry as a basis for defense and for further industrialization, private cars were considered a luxury and production was limited largely to autos for official use. Nikita S. Khrushchev also frowned on the use of private cars during his rule, from 1933 to 1964, ostensibly on the ground that they represented a wasteful use of scarce resources. He urged instead a well developed rental system that never materialized. It was only under the present leadership that a fundamental policy change in favor of private car ownership took effect., Compared with Western nations, the automobile age is still in its infancy in the Soviet Union, prices are high and waiting lists long. But the course has been charted. As if to commemorate the radical shift in attitudes, the weekly newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta published today comprehensive set of statistics on the production, sales and ownership of private cars. In the past, such figures were available only piecemeal in scattered publications or were simply not published. Though concerned primarily with literary matters, the weekly also takes an active interest in social and economic issues, among which the present “automobilization,” as the Russians call it, is probably the most timely. Literaturnaya Gazeta revealed, for example, that 300 private cars a week are now being sold in Moscow, a city with a population of seven million. Total private car ownership in the Soviet capital was given as 110,000. A surprisingly large number of cars‐82,000—was listed for Leningrad, the nation's second largest city, with a population of four million. Total private car ownership in the Soviet Union as a whole, with a population of 240 million was given as “more than 1.5 million.” Among the Soviet republics, per capita ownership of private cars appears to be highest in the Georgian Republic of the Caucasus According to the new figures, the Republic, with a population of 4.7 million, has 55,000 private cars. By contrast, the Ukraine, another highly developed state, has only 309,000 for 10 times Georgia's population. The literary weekly said that total car sales to private owners were 123,000 last year, or about one‐third of total passenger car production, with the others going to official use or for export. By the end of the current five‐year plan in 1975, private car purchases are planned to increase to 750,000 a year, or about two‐thirds of the total output envisaged for that year. In addition to the Gorky auto plant, where about 100,000 Volga cars are being produced each year, the newspaper listed four factories producing pas senger cars, with their output last year and planned production for 1975. At Togliatti, where the Fiat, or Zhiguli, as the Russians call lit, is being produced, output is planned to rise from 21,500 last year to 660,000 by 1975. The Moscow factory producing the Moskvich, roughly of the same size as the Fiat, will turn out 170,000 cars by 1975 compared with 101,500 in 1970. A second plant producing the Moskvich, the Izhevsk factory in the Urals, is scheduled to raise production from 36,000 to 160,000 during this period. Finally, the Zaporozhe plant of the Ukraine, which manufactures the tiny Zaparozhets, is to raise output from 84,000 last year to 140,000 by 1975.

Murry Bergtraum, the board's president, said committees con sisting of school, union, parent and community representatives were being set up in all five boroughs to seek a restoration of state budget cuts affecting the city and state approval of increased taxing powers for the city. Last Monday, Mayor Lindsay announced that 90,000 city jobs, including 20,000 school positions, would have to be eliminated unless the city's budget situation for 1971–72 improved substantially. Mr. Bergtraum said that the school board intended to re quest meetings with Governor Rockefeller, Mayor Lindsay, the state's legislative leaders and other elected officials to “tell them that the citizens of this city insist that funds must be found for necessary services and are prepared to accept higher taxes as the price of averting a disaster to the city.” He made the statement after meeting with representatives of parent, community and teacher and supervisory groups for two hours at board headquarters, 110 Livingston Street, Brook lyn. Newsmen were not per Mr. Bergtraum said that many community representa tives reported at the meeting that “the public had become so numbed by recurring budget crises that they were now hav ing great difficulty arousing people to the seriousness of the current crisis.” Earlier, Albert Shanker, pres ident of the United Federation of Teachers, said that the 65, 000‐member union would apply “maximum pressure on the Mayor, the Governor and the Legislature in support of pro gressive state and local total income tax hikes” to avert the budget cuts. He told a news conference at the Gramercy Park Hotel that if the school system cut 17,300 teaching positions, as proposed under the Mayor's most stringent budget option, class sizes would have to be increased to 45 pupils or the present school day of six hours and 20 for pupils would have to be cut to three hours. “It would be impossible for the schools to operate,” he warned. Mr. Shanker said that the teachers' federation would join in a rally at City Hall on Tues day at 9 A.M. to protest the budget cuts. At City Hall, Thomas B. Morgan, the Mayor's press secretary, said that about 30 per cent of the people working in public relations in city agen cies were being laid off. The layoffs will affect 68 of the 225 persons working in this field in 26 city agencies directly under the Mayor's control. The Mayor's public relations staff will be cut from 12 persons to seven. In another development, the City Club, one of the city's oldest independent civic groups, sought to save the Green Book —the official annual city di rectory—from falling under the Mayor's economy ax. It offered to pay the city $1 a year for the right to publish the Green Book, and agreed to continue to publish it in the same general style (pocket size) and quality for the next five years.

1187-> WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON, April 15—According to well‐informed Ping‐Pong circles, the United States and China are now turning a “new page” or beginning a “new era's or something like that, but the China experts here are suspicious of all sweeping cliches. They think Peking has decided that Washington really is going to get out of Vietnam, and that officials in mainland China want to be in on the talks about post‐war arrangements. Also, the talks on nuclear arms control, on a limited Middle East agreement to open the Suez Canal, on the power struggle between East and West Pakistan and on the future of Japan are all reaching an important phase. and the experts believe Peking wants to be sure that it has a voice in shaping events in this vast area, rather than leaving all this to the leadership of the United States and the Soviet Union. There is general agreement within the ‘Washington Government and the embassies representing governments with missions in Peking that mainland China's sudden change of tone is both hopeful and significant, but officials tend to regard the switch as a tactical move rather than a basic change in Peking's policy. In fact, the very suddenness of the Chinese move is a warning to the experts not to be too dogmatic about what it means. As President Nixon said in his second annual world report a few weeks ago, a new Asia is emerging; the United States is making substantial cuts in its military forces in Vietnam; Japan, Okinawa, Korea, Thailand and the Philippines; new regional economic arrangements are being made by the nations of the Pacific basin, and in view of all this, it would be surprising if Peking wants to watch these developments in isolation. But beyond that, the China experts are not willing to predict with any confidence. They agree that Peking would not have started smiling if it really thought Mr. Nixon was going to invade North Vietnam or try to establish permanent military bases in Southeast Asia. They also agree that Peking's move was probably made to minimize Moscow's influence in the post‐war settlements rather than to indicate any new spirit of friendliness toward Washington. So the watchword here is caution. The Sino‐Soviet conflict may be irreparable, as most experts seem to believe, but after Mao Tse‐tung, nobody is willing to guess about the mood or direction of China. He could be followed by a Khrushchev seeking easier relations with the non‐Communist world, or by a Stalin, determined to restore the Moscow‐Peking alliance in a more hostile coalition against the West. Accordingly, modest short‐term interpretations are about all the experts are willing to venture. They are pleased with the change of attitude. They are hoping it will persuade Hanoi to make the necessary moves to get President Nixon to carry out his offer of total withdrawal from Vietnam, but beyond that, they have little to say. Meanwhile, President Nixon is being given credit here for making it easy for Peking to take a more cooperative attitude. Despite his long record of hostility toward Peking before he came into the White House, he has recently been offering them en honorable compromise and recognizing their place as one of the great nations in the world. “In this decade,” he said in his last world report, “there will be no more important challenge than that of drawing the People's Republic of China into a constructive relationship with the world community....We see no advantage to us in the hostility between the Soviet Union and Communist China. We do not seek any. We will do nothing to sharpen that conflict—nor to encourage Ito “We are prepared to establish a dialogue with Peking. We cannot accept its ideological precepts or the notion that Communist China must exercise hegemony over Asia.... Our attitude is public and clear. We will continue to honor our commitments [to Nationalist China] and to the security of our Asian allies (including Nationalist China). An honorable relationship with Peking cannot be constructed at their expense.” Thus the problem of the “two Chinas” remains, as it has for many years. Twenty‐one years ago it seemed that there was another chance to compose the differences between Washington and Peking and bring Communist China into the United Nations, but the chance was lost. “I have now come to believe,” said John Foster Dulles in 1950, “that the United States will best serve the cause of peace if its Assembly is representative of what the world actually is, and not merely representative of the parts which we like.... “If the Communist Government of China in fact proves its ability to govern China without serious domestic resistance, then it too should be admitted to the United Nations.... Communist governments today dominate more than 30 per cent of the population of the world. We may not like that fact. Indeed, we do not like it at all. But if we want to have a world organization, then it should be representative of the world as it is.” That was a whole generation ago, and Communist China is still outside the U.N., but it has a real chance this year to get the votes for membership, and this may be one more reason why Peking is changing its tune.

1188-> Sports of The Times
“I think that everyone should get into some sport activity, but I think that people should do it in order to seek the rewards you're supposed to get out of it,” said George Sauer last week in what may have been his valedictory to professional football. “I don't think they should go into any authoritarian system of sport that implicitly and explicitly tries to keep them in a prolonged stale of adolescence.” Sauer announced his retirement through Jack Scott's Institute for the Study of Sport and Society in Oakland, Calif. A few days earlier in New York, the Jets' “1971 preseason prospectus” was issued. It included this line: “Sauer, who is starting his seventh season at only 27, expected to he completely healthy and ready to resume his fine career, which had him averaging 65 catches per season since becoming a regular.” Sauer's retirement is at least the fourth recent declara tion of discontent by a major league football player. Dave Meggysey and Rick Sortun of the Cardinals are more politically oriented and Chip Oliver of the Raiders, who planning a counter‐culture training camp this July in which he will lead deep‐breathing exercises, is certainly more show business. But Sauer, the most accomplished of the four in the public mind and the best‐known as a player, may have the most impact on other questioning athletes. He left a rising career and he dropped an ethic he had borne, albeit uneasily all his life—his father was a famous player and now scouts. And unlike the others, he left affirming his love for the game itself while assailing a “system” that “works to mold you into someone easy to manipulate.” A few days after Sauer's announcement, a 17‐year‐old New York high school student, discussing his applications for a college basketball scholarship, suddenly said: “Hey, just because I'm into this thing don't think I'm not hip what's going on. It all comes down to an overemphasis on winning. Look at Sauer: he was on the top and he quit. Why? Because he saw that sports isn't for the athletes any more. It's for the coaches and it's for the big money.” Not all coaches are so sure that sports is for them. The Fellowship of Christian Athletes, in a recent survey of college recruiting, perhaps the single most corruptive procedure in all American sports, reported this comment by a coach: “There are nice boys who won't he bought, just as there are good coaches who won't sell out. Athletics, if run properly, may be the best thing in the world today.” The day before Sauer called the Jets' office to say good‐by, New York University announced it was dropping varsity track and basketball, for years the basis of its na tional reputation. The university's financial crisis was cited, although the financial figures offered were not very con vincing. A university with a projected $9‐million deficit, with an announced $198.5‐million total expenses and ap propriations, was dropping two sports at an estimated saving of only $500,000. “The money is chicken feed, I personally just think it was a tactic,” says a budget administrator at another university. “Cuts had to he made throughout N. Y. U. and the students and the faculty had to he pacified. You couldn't keep something as highly visible as track and basketball when you're chopping away at departments that people now consider more important.” The N. Y. U. decision brings up two interesting points: first, the moral discomfort of one top pro, one anonymous coach and one teen‐ager about to step onto the national sports stage, is not the private problem of a few disaffected insiders—if N. Y. U. can drop its banner sports without student uprising or an ad hoc faculty study group, then that university's constituents no longer hold that big‐time sports are necessary to a university's esprit and reputation, if they ever did: second, the rising sentiment among many athletes and coaches that they are merely objects is given credibility at N. Y. U. In good faith—within the reality a corruptive system—coaches recruited teen‐agers for four years of competition at N. Y. U. and promised them the opportunity to develop as athletes and students. The uni versity broke the contract.

The Bacchanalian Bash (O Bacchus, what has been wrought in thy name?) will be a preview opening of the new restaurant and nightclub, Roma De Notte, at 137 East 55th Street. The general public may sample the nighttime of Rome the next evening. No charity, no tickets, just a big private invite for withit adults who have an “X” rating. Pet the White Shark, Then a Hippopotamus Supper May 11—Peter R. Gimbel, a cinemamaker and depth‐plumber, is inviting 500 of his friends to the opening of his new film, “Blue Water, White Death” — “a record of four divers’ 12,000‐mile quest for the great white shark.” After the show at the Festival Theater, Peter and his mother, Mrs. Bernard F. Gimbel will entertain about 300 of the white shark viewers at a supper party at the Hippopotamus. Those attending both film and supper have some names Ward's original list might have omitted (time and circumstances, you know) but it will do for a super list today—Buckleys, Cushings, Fricks, Goelets, Heinzes, Herreras, Lehmans, Lindsays, Phippses, Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Ryans and on and on. Fête Champêtre Takes an Oriental Twist May 11—The Rainbow Room will not look exactly like Haroun‐al‐Raschid's seraglio but the committee for the annual dinner dance of Fountain House has requested that women guests wear “Hot Pants to Harem Pants.” We know they're different lengths, but isn't there a redundancy here? The men must eschew the exotic for the ubiquitous and wear black tie. Lots of prizes. One, a fur rug from Jacques Kaplan—is it a flying carpet? Proceeds to aid Fountain House's rehabilitation center for former patients of mental institutions. Mrs. Francis Belmont is chairman. Tickets $60 for seniors, $30 for juniors. (No age differential for hot pants?) Be a Fairy Godmother—The Kind that Waves the Wand May 11—For many years the Children's Day Treatment Center and School, Inc., on West 71st Street was known as the Godmothers’ League.

Shapiro is chairman. Tickets $25. The Early Bird Catches the Tickets May 11, 18, 25—Three remaining spring art tours of a series of four during the month of May by the Child Study Association of America.

These crusaders put teeth in conservation projects. They help keep saw teeth out of giant redwoods and damn Grand Canyon dams. At the Atlantic's third annual dinner in the Commodore's Windsor Ballroom their theme will be Long Island Sound, a once unpolluted paradisaical body of water. Can they dredge the sludge and make it really Sound again? Two people will win ($3 a ticket) a three‐week vacation on the “Forgotten Islands” of the Indian Ocean. Dinner tickets $15 a person. Dinner chairman is Mrs. Albert H. Clayburgh. “Dig We Must” May 12—That's what the Women's Division of the Park East Synagogue as well as the rest of the congregation have been saying to themselves since they pledged $100,000 for the building fund of the synagogue's Cultural Center and School. The Sisterhood's annual spring luncheon and fashion show at the Pierre will help and, in September, the first shovel of earth will start the hole they'll be glad to be in. The synagogue's far‐sighted founders bought the house and lots on East 68th Street in 1887, when they acquired the temple property. They were Orthodox, and so is the synagogue today, but the Cultural Center is for everyone of all ages, races and creeds. The center seeks to fill the cultural and social needs “of lonely singles who reach for something they're still not certain about.” And the Park East Synagogue, though its beliefs are rooted in heritage and tradition, understands Aggiornamento, too.

It will be done well, that's certain, because that's the way the M.S.‐K.C.C. volunteers do everything. Bill Harrington will provide the music, but not Lohengrin for this one. Tickets $50. Mrs. Theodore S. Gary is chairman. Prinny's Pleasure Dome May 14—The Friends of the Henry Street Settlement are sprightly young people who are not the only charitable group to discover that gambling, all nice and legal for donated prizes, is a short route to benefactors’ hearts and a great help to the kitty. So this year the gaming tables will be set up in the Pierre's Garden Foyer before the dinner dance in the Grand Ballroom and the whole evening will take for its theme a rakehell era when stakes were high, bucks were exquisitely dressed young males of the ton, and whose great men hid their brilliance beneath assumed languor but kept old Boney well away from their tight little isle. At the center of this uninhibited society was Prinny (Prince Regent and later George IV) who tired of gaming at Almack's in town, shook up a little Sussex fishing village named Brighthelmslone by transforming it into a seaside resort and building a dream palace with all the fantasy and splendor of Xanadu, which he named the Brighton Pavilion. With the LSD (pounds, shillings and pence that meant, not acid, egad) flowing so freely, the townspeople found bigger fish in the pleasure industry and changed the name of their village to match the Pavilion's. Tickets at $30 a head may be obtained from the co‐chairmen, Mrs. Richard A. Furniss Jr. of 110 East End Avenue and Miss Monica Lesko of 2 Tudor City. Keeping on the Beam May 14—Alex Webster of the Giants and Weeb Eubank of the Jets, peerless directors of play, and locker‐room orators for New York's pro football teams, will receive The LighthouseEd Sullivan Sports Award at the 13th annual Lighthouse Sports World Dinner Dance.

May 15—The New York Chapter of the Military Order of the World Wars has been official New York sponsor of the Armed Forces Day Parade for 18 years. The chapter is giving a gala reception in Park Avenue's Seventh Regiment Armory for Adm. Thomas H. Moorer, U.S.N., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, after the admiral has munched and lunched at a stag tiffin in the Metropolitan Club and then been chief reviewing officer of the Fifth Avenue parade. The reception, at $10 a ticket, will provide funds for the morale and recreational activities of the military in the New York area. Lieut. Col. John Rice, U.S.A.R., retired, is chapter commander. “Women of the Year” Galore From Auxiliaries 34 May 16—City Controller Abe Beam will be guest of honor, but he had better stand on a chair or he will be upstaged by the volunteers selected from each of the 34 Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center auxiliaries for their outstanding work.

David L. Yunich, president of Macy's, New York, and general campaign chairman of the Scouts Greater New York Councils, is boss of the WaldorfAstoria show. He has so many prestigious aides and former gala chairmen to advise, guide and persuade him that, after it's all over, running that world's largest emporium is going to be a cinch. Seven hundred and fifty guests will dance to Peter Duchin's rhythms at $75 a ticket and $30 for juniors. The Greater New York Councils’ budget of $2,120,000 for the year will help extend scouting programs to 92,000 youths. How to Assure the Perfect Pas de Deux May 17—The Friends of the Children's rood Foundation want to be sure. dtrlfmited champagne at their Pierre Grand Ballroom supper dance is expected to put 250 couples in a dancing mood.

Mount Your Highwheeler and Pedal in the Park May 18—The bicycle craze struck New York before the turn of the century. Genteel conservatives deplored the rage and applauded the Rev. Asa D. Blackburn's sermon, “You Cannot Serve God and Skylark on a Bicycle.” The pursuers of happiness on wheels paid no attention. Were Mayor Lindsay then a youth, he also would have joined the cyclists of Fun City. The Mayor is going to cut a ribbon at the Plaza entrance to Central Park at 59th Street at 7 P.M. and pedal to the Tavern‐on‐the‐Green. So will August Heckscher and Don Durgin, N.B.C.‐TV head, and his Tess, cochairmen of the Bicycle Bash, and several hundred other supporters of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary benefit. Some less adept at balancing will go in hansoms to the restaurant, at one time an abode of sheep. Once there, cocktails, dinner and Skitch Henderson and his orchestra await purchases of $45 tickets (bicycles included for across park parade). The party proceeds will help in a $500,000 drive to start construction of a nurses’ residence for the infirmary.

The first one visits the Selig Burrows’ duplex featured in May's House Beautiful; then an 1890 limestone townhouse; Huntington Hartford's studied clutter in his Beekman Place pad—memorabilia, letters, paintings by a former wife (what happened to the Burne‐Joneses?); a century‐old Greenwich Village house turned Mexican; an apartment on Central Park South, another in the Dakota. The second tour really has headliners with Hermione Gingold showing her personally hand‐stitched chair seats, and Mrs. Albert D. Lasker's unspecked all‐white interiored house on the East River, the Italian Ambassador to the United Nations Piero Vinci's Gotham palazzo and three others. This can't go on as long as you can.

The profits will further the army's work with young people, which includes day care centers, a coffee house in Greenwich Village, summer camps, music and recreation programs. Tickets $50 for ballet, $100 for ballet and supper dance. Dan Seymour, president of J. Walter Thompson, is chairman and Mrs. Marlyn Tsai is co‐chairman. Honors to the Honorable May 18—The Rev. Dr. Nathan A. Perilman, spiritual leader of Congregation Emanu‐El, largest Jewish house of worship in the world, will be honored at a luncheon of the Friends of the Counseling Center of the New York Federation of Reform Synagogues in the Hilton Room of the WaldorfAstoria.

Coleman, chairman.

1190-> 68 HOUSES HERE TO GET 1% LOANS
The city announced plans yesterday for 68 town houses in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn that individual fam ilies could buy on 30‐year mort gages with 1 per cent interest rates. The 68 units would be the first housing here to receive Federal assistance previously thought inapplicable in New York City because of the high cost of building a single house here. Details of the plan were made public yesterday when the Housing and Development Administration sought a zoning change for the project before the City Planning Commission. Pending approval by the com mission and the Board of Esti mate, officials said, construc tion can be expected to start in May. The 68 houses would receive aid under Section 235 of the Federal Housing and Urban De velopment Act of 1968, which authorizes money to lower the interest rate on a private mort gage to 1 per cent for single family homes. Officials said yesterday that previous efforts to develop fed erally assisted single‐family houses ended in failure because the housing did not meet Fed eral cost limitations. The limitation is $24,200 for a house to be occupied by a family of four or more. Under the plan, no family will be re quired to make a down pay ment of more than $200 and then pay a monthly carrying charge of $135 to $150. Families of five must have incomes between $9,000 and $12,000 a year, housing offi cials said. The development will be sponsored, designed and built by Peter Perpignan, a Queens engineer, who has been aided by low land costs.

1191-> Woman, 639 Dies in Apartment Robbery
A 63‐year‐old, woman was found dead in her ransacked apartment in a Levier East Side housing project yesterday after she and her daughter had been tied up and beaten by two men posing as repairmen. It was the third robberyrelated death in three months of an elderly person living in public housing in the area. It occurred despite an attempt by the City Housing Authority police to increase protection by assigning to the projects extra men from its special “task force” for troubled developments. However, a spokesman for the City Housing Authority said that despite these and other incidents, crime in the area's projeets was only one–third what it was in, the surrounding slum neighborhood. The latest victim was identified by the police as Mrs. Diana Appelbaum of 140 Columbia Street in the Baruch Houses. She and her daughter, Rachel, 38, were bound with stockings, and a rag was stuffed into the mother's mouth, a spokesman for the city police said. He said that the cause of the elderly woman's death was not immediately known. It could have been from the injuries suffered in the beating or from “strangling, suffocation or a heart attack,” he said. Chief Daniel J. Daly of the Housing Authority police, which is investigating the crime with the city police, said last night that the women's apartment had been ransacked, but that “we don't know what's missing yet.” He said this would he determited after the daughter, who was spending last night with friends after having been treated for her bruises, returned to the apartment. A city police spokesman said the women were, on Welfare. As of last night, there were no suspects. The city police said that the two men, between, 25 and 30 years old, had knocked on the door of the women's third‐floor apartment about 1 P.M. and said they were repairmen. After demanding money and threatening to kill the women, the police said, the men beat the women and tied them up. At about 3 P.M., after the men had fled, Rachel Appelbaum freed herself and called for help. When the police arrived, they found the women's belongings strewn over the apartment, and both women badly bruised from the beatings. Baruch Houses is one of three adjacent low‐income public‐housing projects that sprawl for nearly a mile from Delancey Street to 14th Street along the East River. In one of the three, Jacob Riis Houses, an 86‐year‐old man, Benny Pavluk, was killed by a blow on the head in August as he apparently struggled With a robber in his building at 749 Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. In the same building on Sept. 10, a 73‐year‐old widow, Mrs. Anna Weinstein, was found dead in the bedroom of her ransacked apartment. She had been bound, and the cause of her death was attributed to a diabetic coma. She had been unable to get to her medicine because she was tied up. No suspects have been arrested in either case. However, Chief Daly said that detectives were investigating the possibility that two youths, arrested Sept. 24 and charged with at least two other robberies in Baruch Houses, may be implicated in the Weinstein case. A spokesman for the City Housing Authority, Val Coleman, said that although yesterday's death was “a terrible tragedy, an ugly crime, and statistics are no comfort to the victim, the fact remains that, per capita, crime in public housing in this area is one–third of what it is in the surrounding neighborhood. “In other words, it's three times safer being in the projects than in the surrounding neighborhood.” Baruch, Riis and Lillian Wald Houses, which is between the first two, house more than 23,000 persons in 5,800 apartments located in 52 red brick buildings. A number of the tenants are elderly and are easy prey for the many narcotics addicts in the area. The projects are next to East River Park, which the police say is a hangout for drug addicts and a haven for the area's muggers and robbers after they flee the scenes of their crimes. The housing police said that one two‐man team of robberburglars had recently been convicted after committing 15 crimes in the area. A team of three alleged robber‐burglars was arrested in late August after committing nearly three dozen crimes in the neighborhood, the housing police said. These were in addition to the two youths arrested Sept. 24.

1192-> Large Issues, Large Men
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.—President Nixon has said that he will appoint “strict constructionists” to the Su preme Court. The phrase does not sug gest an appointee who is likely to be a great justice of that Court. Indeed, given the nature of the Court's work, the phrase is not very helpful in the process of selection. The October, 1971, term of Court has just opened. What are some of the great public issues which the Court will face? Over six hundred men and women prisoners under sentences of death wait for the Supreme Court to de cide whether the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment: “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor exces sive fines imposed, nor cruel and un usual punishment inflicted.” To take another example, the Su preme Court of Wisconsin has held it unconstitutional for the state to prose cute Amish parents who, pursuant to their religious belief, refused to send their children to high school. Are the parents protected by the First Amend ment's guarantee of the free exercise of religion or, on the contrary, would an exception made for the Amish vio late that portion of the First Amend ment which forbids laws “respecting an establishment of religion”? These and many other issues have one common characteristic. They can not be resolved by a “strict construc tion” approach to the Constitution. Last term Mr. Justice White made the point even more broadly. Speak ing to the issue whether states are prohibited from spending money in support of parochial schools, he wrote: “It is precisely the kind of issue the Constitution contemplates this Court must ultimately decide. This is true although neither affirmance nor re versal of any of these cases follows automatically from the spare language of the First Amendment, from its history or from the cases of this Court constructing it and even though reasonable men can very easily differ over the import of that language. In short, the answers to most ques tions of importance are determined neither by constitutional text nor by a gloss formulated from history or precedent but by the justices them selves using a considerable variety of material. What sort of person should be chosen to make such determinations? A great justice will be an able lawyer because the justices decide law cases bristling with technical points. He must have a sense of history and re spect for relevant legal materials. To say that the materials do not dictate outcomes is not to say they should be ignored in order to reach results. A great justice is capable of hard intellectual work done with a respect for the past, the Court's role and the country's needs. Integrity, revealed by a commitment to a decent set of prin ciples, is a justice's most valuable asset. The power of the Court, in the long run, depends on its capacity to persuade the country that law and justice are being served. The Supreme Court of all our institutions, is most damaged by a loss of credibility. The President is right in trying to find a Southerner. The very need for a general acceptance of the Court's work makes it desirable for various sections of the country to be repre sented. Indeed, the importance of rep resentation on the Court is under scored by the movement seeking the appointment of a woman and a pre dictable demand that a black member be appointed should Justice Marshall retire. Over 20 per cent of the na tion's population is in the South; surely, a percentage large enough to support a claim for representation. The fundamental question is which Southerner. There are lawyers and judges in the South who have strong credentials. Among the Federal judges, John Butzner of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and Robert Ains worth of the Fifth come to mind. Dis trict Judge Frank Johnson of Alabama has an enviable reputation. Among academic lawyers, Prof. Charles Alan Wright of Texas stands out as a pos sible appointment. The American Bar Association has seldom enjoyed such outstanding leadership as Louis Powell of Richmond provided a few years ago. There is a wealth of legal talent in the South from which to choose a member of the Supreme Court. The selection should be made with excel lence in mind.

Three prison guards accused of using “unnecessary force” against inmates after the riot at the Queens House of Detention last fall were permitted at a Department of Correction hearing yesterday to plead guilty to lesser charges. A fourth guard pleaded guilty to the unnecessary‐force charge. Fifteen other guards will face departmental on similar charges next Tuesday at 111 Centre Street. The man who pleaded guilty to the more serious charge was Daniel Vanderhans. Stanley Arkin, the special Correction prosecutor in the case, said that all four had expressed “contrition” and he recommended that they not be dismissed. The three who pleaded guilty to reduced charges were Michael Barry, and Donald Fuhry, who were recently promoted to assistant deputy warden, and Benson Epstein. All pleaded, guilty to “failure to report the use of force against the inmates.” The hearing examiner, Daniell Gutman, postponed sentencing until after the other hearings are completed.

1195-> 12 KENYANS JAILED IN CONSPIRACY TRIAL
NAIROBI, Kenya, June 8— Sentences ranging from seven years to nine and a half years were imposed today on 12 Ken yans who admitted they had conspired to overthrow the Kenya Government. All plan to appeal. Joseph Daniel Owino, who was described by the magis trate, S. K. Sachdeva, as the “brains of this infamous con spiracy,” was sentenced to nine and half years. Joseph Ouma, who was to have taken up at post as professor at Zambia University shortly was jailed for eight years along with four others, including a senior civil servant and a Nairobi city counselor. The remaining six were jailed for seven years. In passing sentence the mag istrate remarked that the pro secution had described their conspiracy as half‐baked and without one chance in a mil lion of success. However, he said. “Do not agree because one spark can cause a large fire.” It is expected that similar charges will be made against other, more prominent, figures in the next week.

1196-> CHIEF OF CHASE BIDS JAPAN END CONTROLS
LOS ANGELES, June 14 (UPI) —Japan should remove her controls and restrictions on tradee, and capital movements, or revalue the yen, David Rockefeller, chairman of the Chase. Manhattan Bank, said today. Noting that the United States balance‐of‐payments deficit was the counterpart of surpluses in, other countries and that the principal surplus country was Japan, Mr. Rockefeller told the Society of Corporate Secretaries that part of the Japanese surplus stemmed from its network of restrictions and controls over trade and capital movements. “To their credit, the Japanese have been moving to remove controls,” Mr. Rockefeller said. “However, in view of the balance‐of‐payments surplus, which is estimated as some $2‐billion this year, I believe the Japanese should move with the greatest dispatch to do away with remaining controls and restrictions. “If the process is too slow, or if the surplus persists after the controls are removed, then I believe Japan has an obligation to revalue the yen.”

1197-> 24 Suffer Injuries At Westbury Track When Patrons Panic
More than two dozen per sons were injured last night when a Roosevelt Raceway crowd panicked and stampeded because of a loud, hissing noise as gas escaped from a carbon dioxide tank in a soft drink area. It was the second time in two weeks that racegoers were injured in a stampede caused by such noise from a soda fa cility at the Westbury, L. I., harness track. Twenty‐four persons were treated at the Nassau County Medical Center's East Meadow Division in last night's incident. One person was admitted with an apparent heart attack and another with a broken ankle, while 22 were released after being treated, largely for bruises and cuts. A number of others were treated by medical personnel at the track. The incident occurred about 8:40 P.M. after the second race. The carbon dioxide tank was being serviced in a storage room used with a third‐floor soda counter, when the gas es caped with a loud sound, a track spokesman said. “It was a terrible hissing like the stands were falling,” Mrs, Theresa Lambino of Brooklyn said later. Herman Fedec of Brooklyn, who complained of back and arm injuries, said he was at the exacta window when he sud denly saw “people running, gal loping like horses.” “Picture a movie where the locusts take over the earth—that's what it looked like,” he said. The incident did not delay the program, the track spokes Ulan said. Half a dozen persons worn injured.Aug. 11 when panic was caused by noise from faulty release valve in a soda machine at the track.

Made available here today, the report lists a consolidated net loss for the Canadian‐registered parent company of the troubled mutual‐fund group in 1970 of 60.4‐million, or $1.18 per share. This contrasts with a net profit of $10.3‐million, or 21 cents per share, for 1969. The 1970 deficit includes $20.9‐million in extraordinary losses, a write off for goodwill and provisions for reorganization and litigation.

1201-> New Park Fountain Is Spray Thing and a Play Thing
The city's newest piece of playground equipment, a water spray for children that also serves as a decorative park fountain, was unveiled yesterday in Jackson Square Park at Eighth Avenue and Horatio Street by Parks Ad ministrator August Heck scher. The combination fountain and jungle gym was designed and built in yellow steel pipe by Anita Margrill, who has Mrs. Margrill's portable water sculptures are set up in play streets and connected to fire hydrants. She said they provided a visual experi ence as well as a play facility for children and used less water than a conventional spray attachment for fire hydrants. The 8 by 13 foot perma nent fountain in Jackson Square Park replaces a con ventional three‐foot high re movable shower. Mrs. Mar grill said the new system would use about 40 gallons of water a minute, or about half what the shower used. What's more, she said, chil dren can play on the struc ture all year. Another of Mrs. Margrill's water sculptures is installed in a city park in Houston.

1202-> Britain Widens Fight on Oil Pollution
LONDON, April 8—The Government today asserted legal authority to seize or sink any oil tanker threatening to pollute Britain's shores, whether inside or outside her territorial waters. That broad authority, added to pending legislation by an emergency amendment, passed the Commons at 1 o'clock this morning and the Lords this afternoon. The hasty move by the Conservatives followed another in a series of damaging oil spills in the English Channel. The Liberian – flag tanker Panther went aground last week on the Goodwin Sands, which lie off southeastern England outside the three‐mile limit that Britain claims for territorial waters. Dragged off the Goodwin Sands Sunday, the ship moved across the English Channel and beached on the Dutch coast but in the meantime a considerable amount of oil had leaked. A huge slick, containing several hundred tons of oil, has now been spotted in the Channel. Experts were not sure whether it had come from the Panther or from any of three other ships that have gone down in the Channel in the last three months. The Government sent five ships out to spray the oil with a new, supposedly nontoxic detergent developed by British Petroleum. Some scientists have said that detergents kill more marine life than oil does. This morning oil floated onto some beaches in Kent, and the oil and detergent were said to have produced a foul smell. But a rising wind broke up the slick and the local authorities began cleaning what there was on the beaches. Tonight a British tanker collided in the Channel off Beachy Head, Sussex, with a Danish liquid‐gas carrier. The tanker, the Hullgate, carrying 3,000 tons of oil, continued her voyage to a refinery near Southampton after spilling about 500 tons, according to official reports. Since the grounding of the tanker Torrey Canyon In 1967 —the first great oil disaster on the sea—Britain has had contingency plans ready to clean oil off waters and beaches. Though the Torrey Canyon went aground outside British waters, the navy took charge and eventually bombed the tanker in an effort to burn the cargo. The emergency move in Parliament today was apparently designed to provide legal support for any similar action. When the House of Lords debated the amendment, some fears were expressed that the freedom of the seas might be involved. Britain is also taking steps to police navigation in the Channel. There have been suggestions of a helicopter patrol. Lord Sandford speaking for the Government, explained later that it was not, basing its action on any international agreement or convention giving coastal nations the right to protect themselves against pollution. He said the action was an extension of British jurisdiction to such places as the Goodwin Sands, which, although just out– side territorial waters, are close enough for any mishap there to affect British beaches.

1204-> Physicals Go On Despite Draft Lapse
WASHINGTON, Aug. 23—The Selective Service System said today that it would begin giving pre‐induction physical examinations Sept. 1 to about 250,000 19‐year‐olds who drew numbers 1 thruogh 50 in the Aug. 5 lottery for the 1972 draft. Despite the expiration of au thority to call up men for in duction, the Selective Service said it would also go ahead with plans to test 20‐year‐olds holding numbers 125 to 175 for this year's draft. The Selective Service will have no authority to induct anyone until an extension of the law is enacted. The draft authority of the Selective Serv ice law expired last June 30, and legislation that would ex tend it is tied tin in Congress. A Selective Service spokes man said that draft boards were still entitled to provide pre‐induction examina tions early enough for poten tial draftees to know where they stand and for officials to have ample time to process the examinations. It was estimated that only half the number examined would be drafted and that the rest would either fail the ex aminations, qualify for exemp tions or be passed over for other reasons. Assuming that the induction, authority is restored when Congress takes up the matter next month, the first men to, be inducted after Jan. 1 will be a carry‐over group who had low lottery numbers last year but whose deferments kept them from induction. In, calling for pre‐induction physicals, the Selective Serv ice at the same time raised the lottery number ceiling of the draft pool from 150 to 175. But the department spokesman said this was not to be inter preted as an increase in the draft. Margin Maintained He said the service wanted to maintain a margin between those inducted and those ex amined for induction. He noted that, although the ceiling was set at 150 this year, no one with a number higher tan 125 had been drafted. The draft call for July and August, the first two months of the fiscal year 1972, was announced as 16,000 men. NQ one has been drafted because of the Congressional delay. The legislation has been held up by debate on an amendment calling for the removal of all United States troops from Indo china within nine months of the extension if all prisoners of war are released. Since the draft law expired, the Government ha's chosen not to exercise its authority to in duct thousands of young men whose temporary deferments for such reasons as college edu cations have expired. This group was said to be liable for the draft if Congress failed to pass the extension.

1205-> COMPETITION LAG IN NAVY BIDS CITED
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7 — The General Accounting Office said today that an absence of competition among shipbuilders was increasing the Navy's bills for construction and repairs. In addition to the high costs of basic contracts, the G.A.O. said, changes or extras not in the contracts were adding an other 20 to 30 per cent. The accounting office estimated claims pending or about to be filed for changes and extras at about $1‐billion. The G.A.O. made its charges in a report prepared for Sena for William Proxmire, chairman of the Priorities and Economy Subcommittee of the Joint Con gressional Economic Com mittee. The agency noted that last year the Navy began a pro gram designed to reduce the number of contractor claims and to improve ship acquisi tion. It said that the program, including changes in organiza tion, personnel and procure ment procedures, was already in effect. But a spokesman for Senator Proxmire said that the new program, on which the G.A.O. is preparing a supplementary report, could not overcome the economic fact of concentration in the shipbuilding industry that was the root cause of the absence of competition and in creased costs. The Navy is now served by only three major shipbuilders, the spokesman said, whereas in the late nineteen‐sixties there were 12. The G.A.O. said that “com petition is often limited to the few shipyards having the capa bility to construct certain types of vessels.” For example, only one shipyard, Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, has the capability to build nuclear aircraft carriers. Two companies, the Electric Boat Division of General Dy namics, and Newport News Shipbuilding handle all con struction of missile‐equipped nuclear submarines. The same two companies plus the Ingalls Shipbuilding Divi sion of Litton Industries domi nate the construction of other types of nuclear submarines. “It is clear to me,” Senator Proxmire commented, “that these three companies, all of whom are subsidiaries of large conglomerates, exercise enor mous control over the Navy's shipbuilding program.” The effect of such compe tition as does exist, he added, is nullified by changes in con tracts that in one case added 11‐million to an original cost of $39‐million. The report said, in part: “We have been examining nine contracts awarded in fiscal years 1967–70 that amount to about $4‐billion. The contrac tors are Newport News Ship building and Drydock Company, Newport News, Va., and two Litton Industries, Inc., facili ties at Pascagoula, Miss. “Two of the contracts were formally advertised. Five con tracts for about 60 per cent of the total value of the awards were negotiated competitively. The remaining two contracts, involving $680‐million, were awarded on a sole‐source basis. “Only one of the nine con tracts we are examining was essentially complete at the time of our examination. This con struction contract, a firm fixed price type, had changes of about $11‐million added to the basic contract amount of about $39‐ million—an almost 30 per cent increase. Similarly, we found that, in a prior review of ship overhaul contracts, initial awards of about $65‐million were increased by about $23‐ million, or 35 per cent, for supplemental work. “To determine the magnitude of changes, we reviewed con struction contracts for ships that were completed in 1970. Here, changes amounted to $103‐million, or about 22 per cent of original contract prices which totaled $477‐million.”

1206-> Books of The Times
Ted Hughes has written a strange, eerie, powerful set of poems that stand un matched in their singular quality. They resemble a stack of steel beams: slate gray, hard, menacing in their weight, gravity and destructive possibilities. The effect of the book is chilling: there is not a single warm emotion in it. The language is violent, colors are stark, the imagery reduces humans to their animal status. The overriding impres sion the poems leave is of man trapped by God, by nature and by woman. The re sponse to his poems is visceral. In reviewing the poet's earlier “Hawk in the Rain,” the late Edwin Muir spoke of the author's “admirable vio lence.” It's not an adjective one would apply to the current volume. One can admire the workmanship, the force and precision of language. But there is little that is attractive in the bleak, wasteland vistas this Yorkshire‐born English poet conjures up or in the dehu manized cruel nature that rules them. What is Crow? Is it the bird? Yes, it is. Much, for example, is made of its black ness, and there is enough Mid lore in the poems to keep the physical characteristics in front of the reader. But Crow is also much more. He's male, for one, and God's adversary. He is also a kind of mediating spirit —mocking, insulting, sardonic — for man, God and the universe: He is a pagan third force that knows man's true nature and God's too: “Loving his enemies/And having all the weapons.” Crow cannot profit by God's mistakes but he notes them. To Crow the universe is an imper sonal, uncaring, blind collection of forces; God is a muddled tinkerer and man is nothing but a poor, bare, forked animal. Is Crow the poet's alter ego? A lot of read ers will surely think so. “Say Love,” says God, teaching Crow to talk. But as Crow struggles with the word, “the white shark crashed into the sea,” “a tsetse, a mosquito zoomed … to their sundry flesh‐pots,” And he shivered with the horror of Creation. In another poem, Crow “looked at the heavens, littering away/Beyond every limit.” The operative word is the participal. Crow is no more hopeful when he comes to man's nature. The serpent in the garden was “the gliding and push of Adam's blood.” Hunting the “Black Beast,” Crow examines a frog under a microscope, kills his brother, pounds the wall, charges into space. He looks everywhere but in himself. And when he arranges matters more ra tionally, reality becomes “a mishmash of scripture and physics.” Mr. Hughes achieves his effects through careful workmanship. The language basically monosyllabic, the verbs energized, the transitions few. Lines have strong trochaic beginnings and spondaic feet. “A Kill,” found in the early part of the book, contains in 16 lines the following sequence of verbs: flogged, shot, nailed, strangled, clubbed, stabbed, drowned, drugged, tear ing, ripped and smashed. Strung together in this way, they sound like a Robinson Jeffers run amok. But the poem is held rigidly together by Mr. Hughes's over‐all idea, unyielding and de manding. And he differs from Jeffers in that there is in him a complete absence of the sentimental allegiance to nature. In Jeffers, man is always compared to the hawk, the fierce crags and the restless sea, and always to man's detriment. Hughes has no such illusions. Crow finds, at one point, “his every feather the fossil of a murder.” Although the poems yield their own riches, they are dense enough so that not every image or allusion will be instantly clear. As one could easily tell from a read ing Mr. Hughes gave at the Young. Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association at 92d Street and Lexington Avenue Mon day evening, his poems carry an intellec tual ballast hidden in the verse. His com ments on one poem not in the current book, “Kreutzer Sonata,” after the story by Tolstoy, carried such a weight of mean ing that Mr. Hughes remarked drily that the explanation might, turn out to be more interesting than the poem. This was, not true of his remarks on the poems from “Crow” that he read. Nevertheless, without being told, few read ers would know that “A Childish Prank,” depends on a Talmudic gloss on the story of Creation. The problem in the poem is how to get the souls of men into the earthy components God is working with. Crow has the answer, but its grim humor depends largely on the gap between the nature of the problem and the nature of the solution. But even without a single comment, no reader can possibly miss the poet's larger intent. For “Crow” is not a bird of a ‘different color. It is darkness made visible and it reflects the darkness that lies at the heart of the world.

1208-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: Deborah Josephs’ tragic essay, ‘The Right to Die with Dignity” [Op‐Ed Sept. 25], points up the confusions of responsibility that exist with respect to medical care. She says, “There must be a point where a patient is permitted to die.” She resents not being consulted about the treatment of her brother‐in‐law. However, when informed that if she would not permit treatment she would have to remove the patient from the hospital, she balks because “it was the tubes and instruments to which Flip was at tached that were keeping him alive.” Suddenly Mrs. Josephs experiences the dilemna of the physician. She wants her brother‐in‐law to die in dignity, but does not want to pull the tubes and plugs. She has neither the professional qualifications to treat nor the legal right to make decisions for, her brother‐in‐law, yet would like to exact authority without accepting responsibility for his death. Flip was only 23 years old and had the right to ask physicians to fight for his existence. The only alternative would be to give a legal power of at torney for life‐and‐death decisions to his brother and sister‐in‐law. Fifteen years ago I took care of a 68‐year‐old woman who had suffered a heart attack. Her niece, distressed at the cost of care for her aunt, de manded that I stop oxygen; and indeed one day I entered the room just as the niece had taken the old woman from the oxygen tent and started to “exer cise” her. When I stopped that perni cious nonsense, she “fired” me. I pointed out to her that at this particu lar moment I was her aunt's guardian, and then banned her from visiting again. I still receive Christmas cards from this 83‐year‐old formerly mori bund patient. Mrs. Josephs and The Times have opened a pandora's box of problems at a time when medicine is rapidly be coming institutionalized. The questions that will have to be resolved are: Who bears responsibility for the care of the patient? Can physicians accept it with out complete authority for patient care? Can others interfere? Can the authority and responsibility be shared? The answers will not be easy, but the questions must be met. What Mrs. Josephs fails to under stand is that physicians share her sen timents. They don't want 23‐year‐old boys to get cancer, they don't want their patients to suffer, and they do want to protect the dignity of the dying. But in the fight for life these balances are hard to achieve. We try to fulfill the trust of life the patient has placed in our hands. But there is a moment when the physician realizes that death should come; that he should step aside and afford the patient only his final comforts. This decision is delicate and awesome, and had best be made in the privacy of his own conscience. CHARLES Minus, M.D. Toms River, N. J., Sept. 25, 1971

1209-> Adirondack State Park Residents Await Development Agency With Mixed Feelings
LAKE PLACID, N. Y., Aug. 23 — Residents in the Adi rondack State Park are await ing, with a mixture of fervent hope and vehement opposi tion, the day next week when a new state agency will be established to regulate de velopment in the six‐million acre area. On a recent trip through the area, an unspoiled pre serve about the size of Ver mont, interviews with land owners, politicians, business men and environmentalists produced agreement about the agency on only one point: If it is to succeed, it must reconcile the interests of the 103,000 full‐time residents of the region, who primarily depend upon tourism for their livings, with those of con servationists. The conservationists — as one man put it—want an un trammeled wilderness devoid of “Coney Island schlock” and “the miniature golf course syndrome writ large.” But the situation is a good deal more complex than the frequently espoused notion that what is solely at issue is a tug of war between money‐hungry businessmen eager for neon strips of motels versus “purists” who want endless vistas un touched by human habitation. Landowner Conflict There are conflicts between rich, private landowners with huge tracts that they use sea sonally, and small landhold ers who live all year in the mountains. There are local politicians who feel that the creation of the Adirondack Park Agency at the request of Governor Rockefeller has usurped the powers of local government as well as the right of a pri vate landowner to use his property as he sees fit. There are developers eager to build second homes in the woods and near lakes who see the agency as a threat to their plans. There are real estate speculators who have used the confusion about what the park agency is designed to do to spread rumors ranging from “sell now or the state will seize your land” to “buy now be fore the state halts all sales.” There are varying defini tions of “tourist”—ranging from the hiker with a ruck sack who wants to sleep out under the stars to the family willing to pay high rates for a lakeside view from a motel window. There are naturalists se riously concerned about the already overused hiking trails who feel that any further de velopments will encroach on “forever wild” lands owned by the state and that even tually the largest wilderness tract east of the Mississippi River may be lost. Panel Members a Concern This potpourri of interests is not lost on Governor Rock efeller and the aides he has chosen to select the seven member agency, at least four of whom must be full‐time residents of the Adirondacks. These aides are sifting through the names of nomi nees, hoping to strike a bal ance among the interests in volved and aware that the final choices will no doubt elicit some frowns. “These appointments are very very damned important,” said Harry W. Albright Jr., executive assistant to the Governor and the man most directly involved in getting the agency started. The legislation creating the park agency had rough sled ding in its original form in the Legislature and was sol idly opposed by lawmakers representing the Adirondacks. The compromise bill that finally was passed, after per sistent prodding by the Gov ernor, represented a dilution of the recommendations of the Temporary Commission on the Future of the Adiron dacks, which sent a lengthy report to the Governor last January. Plan to be Developed Under the bill signed by the Governor, the park agency will come into being Sept. 1 with an initial appro priation of $250,000. It must submit to the Legislature by Jan. 1, 1973, a land‐use and development plan for the 3,750,000 acres of privately owned forests, lakes, moun tains and streams in the park. The remaining 2,240,000 acres are owned by the state. This land is known as the Adirondack Forest Preserve and is protected by the “For ever Wild” section of the state Constitution. More than half of the pri vately owned land, some 1, 963,000 acres, is in the hands of only 626 owners. While the so‐called master plan for private land is be ing developed, the park agency has interim powers to review any proposed de velopment in the Adirondack Park “which might have an adverse effect upon the park's unique, scenic, his torical, ecological and natu ral resources,” according to the law. A private landowner plan ning a project must submit a One of the compromises that was hammered out in the Legislature exempted from the agency's interim powers communities that en acted zoning ordinances by last July 1. Several communities, leery about the agency, took ad vantage of this clause and rammed through zoning ordi nances at the last minute which many feel are of ques tionable legality and validity. One member of the tem porary commission, who did not wish his his name used because of the “delicacy” of current negotiations, said that the agency must be forceful enough to avoid tainting the Adirondacks with the kind of developments that have sprung up around Saranac Lake and Lake Placid. Others, similarly committed to the wilderness concept, also cited Lake Placid and Lake George as examples of rampant development, unim peded by a central plan for land use. Centralized Growth Urged Those who scoff at places such as Lake Placid, which is choked with noonday traffic clustering around the many motels, are, in turn, chided for being “purists” who, in the words of James DeZalia chairman of the Essex County Board of Supervisors, “insist that no one has a right to en joy these state lands unless he is willing to put a pack on his back and hike over the mountains.” According to the commis sion member, himself a large landowner, the holders of large tracts, some in excess of 100,000 acres, are inter ested in a centralized devel opment plan for the Adi rondacks because “as the present generation of large owners die off their heirs are bound to sell off for inheri tance tax purposes and those who'll buy will be the de velopers.” Retention of the entire six million‐acre tract, making up about 18 per cent of all the land in the state, as a wilder ness is a “naive hope,” said William K. Verner, curator of research for the Adirondack Museum, in the serene village of Blue Mountain Lake. Mr. Verner said he hoped the park agency would pay particular attention to the central and high‐peak areas of the Adirondacks, where nature enthusiasts flock to climb all of the 46 peaks that exceed 4,000 feet. There is a special cachet to being a “46‐er”—Mr. Ver ner said, but the peaks are threatened with overuse” and people have got to find other goals.” Mrs. Mary Prime is a sixth generation Adirondacker and she would not live anywhere else. A demure, pleasant wo man, she has been recom mended by many in Lake Placid as a park agency member. Independence Stressed Mrs. Prime said she well understood the suspicion of Adirondackers toward yet another state agency. “We're independent peo ple,” she said, “but life has become too complicated and there are so many people. There's a certain apprehen sion on the part of small landowners that they'll lose their identity.” One avowed opponent of the agency is Lilbern Yan don, the Supervisor of the Town of Newcomb, which re cently passed a zoning ordi nance, because, Mr. Yandon said frankly, “we wanted to beat the bill.” No one seriously wants to turn the Adirondacks into a neon amusement park,Mr. Yandon said, adding ‘that businessmen in the region were well aware of the need to preserve what it is that attracts visitors in the first place. “But we feel we're as well qualified to decide what to do with our property as the professionals,” he said, “we live here.” Assemblyman Glenn H. Harris, a Republican from Canada Lake, is another who is taking a dubious look at the agency. “I am gravely concerned if he doesn't balance it,” Mr. Harris said in a reference to the Governor. Aides of Mr. Rockefeller are aware that Mr. Harris and other Adirondack repre sentatives fought the bill this year and will be pre pared to do battle with fu ture Adirondacks legislation if some of their demands are not met. The State Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, Henry L. Diamond, is by law an ex‐officio member of the park agency. To him the agency will be “a Solomon like operation” because “the ‘forever wild’ people are go ing to want to stop every thing and the developers will want to keep eating away.”

1210-> U.S. Aides See Improved Chance for Suez Accord
PARIS, June 8—United States officials say that a message from President Anwar el‐Sadat of Egypt had slightly advanced the prospects for an interim agreement this year on reopen ing the Suez Canal. The chief United States dip lomat in Cairo, Donald C. Bergus, converted the message on Sunday to Secretary of State William P. Rogers, who is at tending a meeting here of The 123‐nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and De velopment. The message clari fied some points raised in the meetings between Mr. Sadat and Mr. Rogers in Cairo last month. The Americans base their confidence on what they de sccribe as a considerable area of agreement between the Is raelis and Egyptians on general principles. They acknowledge, however, that large areas of disagreement remain. As these officials cautiously put it, the outlook for a Suez accord is as follows: Both sides agree that it would be desirable for the canal to re??pen, that the Egyptians should run it, that there should be some withdrawal by the Is raelis, that Egypt would have to reoccupy at least part of the territory on the eastern bank, that a cease‐fire would have to be declared and that the reopening would not be an end in itself but the prelude to a final peace agreement. The two sides are still in dispute over how many Egyp tians would cross the canal and how far inland they would go. They also have not yet re solved the duration of a cease fire or the apparently overrid ing question of how to link an interim agreement on the canal, to a final peace. The Egyptians insist that the accord must be part of an agreed move toward a total Is raeli withdrawal from the ter ritory occupied in 1967. The Israelis affirm that they will negotiate on borders, but will not yield all the occupied terri tory, and especially not in ad vance of negotiations for a final agreement. The American sources said they did not think this diver gence was an insurmountable obstacle to an interim accord. They indicated confidence that a formula could be devised that would pledge both sides to fulfill the United Nations Security Council Resolution of Nov. 22, 1967. The resolution bars acquisi tion of territory by force and calls for an Israeli withdrawal “from occupied territories” but also, for the right of all Middle Eastern countries to exist “within secure and recognized boundaries.” The Americans insisted that the Nixon Administration had not revised its interpretation of the resolution as ruling out all but “insignificant” border ad justments. But they said today, that there were wide areas for negotiation over the status of Sham el Sheik, the Gaza Strip and the west‐bank area of Jor dan, all of which are occupied by Israel. An Israeli source here said today that his Government would go “very far” to see the canal reopened, because such move would reduce tensions in the Middle East and might les sen Soviet pressure. But he add ed that the Egyptians would have to agree to an indefinite cease‐fire and to keep their military forces from crossing the canal. An Egyptian said that both conditions were unacceptable to Cairo. He silo drew a dis tinction between clearing the canal, on which an interim agreement might be reached, and actually reopening it, which he said would be disas trous to Egypt if there were not a prior agreement on a total withdrawal by Israel. French speculation has cen tered on negotiations toward limited Egyptian military presence on the eastern bank and a six‐month cease‐fire cov ering the period of clearing the canal and negotiations toward a peace settlement.

1211-> Blacks in Georgia Let White Minority Share Power
SPARTA, Ga.—Horrie Rives, who is 82 years old, sat with his 52‐year‐old son, Noel, on a wooden bench on the shaded front porch of the red brick Hancock County courthouse building and caught the cool breezes that blew along wind ing, sun‐drenched Route 15. “Yes, this is our first time sitting here,” the stooped cotton farmer told a stranger. “Years ago you couldn't sit here, col oreds couldn't, and we were just too scared to open our mouths—years ago.” Reflecting a calm, quiet bold ness evident in many Southern communities where black peo ple have been politically active in recent years, the Riveses had come to town “to try to get back some land the white folks took from us in 1964— they kicked us off of it.” Their county, one of some 30 in the South where majority blacks have taken over the po litical apparatus, has attracted wide attention because its black population, numbering about 8,000, deliberately took no more than a controlling share of the offices from the 2,500 whites, thus allowing the white minor ity to retain a role in county power. It is also here that an un common black economic ven ture, a cooperative catfish farming effort, is expected to produce some $250,000 a year for the mostly poor, mostly black farmers in the area. The political revolution here came with relative quiet during recent years as a highly organized black political ma chine selectively took two of the three county commissioner offices, three of the five seats on the board of education and the positions of county ordinary (or probate judge) and clerk of the Superior Court. In vir tual control of the county, blacks then appointed a black warden for the county prison and two black sheriff's deputies. With a commanding majority, and a young and enthusiastic political organization — using two dozen radio‐equipped vehicles—the black leadership in Hancock County chose to allow some whites to remain in office in an effort, some said, to gain white cooperation for county programs. This intent has reportedly gained some white support, and at the same time the fact that black county leaders are head ing the county government has evoked broad black support and confidence that their interests are being considered. “We've come to talk to the new ordinary,” said Horrie Rives, who wore heavy work shoes, faded workpants held up by wide suspenders and a clean white shirt. While he talked to a visitor, his daughter‐in law, Louise, and her 7‐year‐old foster son, John, inspected the “Let No Man Thirst” inscrip tion on an old, no longer used water fountain that still Showed two spigots at each end de signed to keep the drinkers separated by race. “I hear the new ordinary's fair,” Mr. Rives said, “I hear she's colored.” The Riveses were soon ush ered into the ordinary's office, a large, carpeted room with a noisy air‐conditioner, rows of books on the Georgia state laws and a single, brightly hued water‐color of a rainy day in Paris above the official's neat desk. Miss Edith Ingram, a black former school teacher who was born in Hancock County 29 years ago, has been the ordi nary since November, 1969. She advised the family to hire a lawyer to look after their interests. Walking back into the hot afternoon, the Riveses were en couraged. Mrs. Rives said: “My father‐in‐law had more than 470 acres. The white people told him he owned only 200 and they put him off his own land.” Mr. Rives volunteered that it was “good to talk to your own people” about the land dispute. Later, Judge Ingram said that many black people came di rectly to her with problems that a lawyer could often set tle with a search of the rec ords. For many years, she sur mised, problems of this sort had gone unattended because of either fear or ignorance. Although Judge Ingram re cords the county's births, deaths and marriages, most of her judicial duties center on the disposition of traffic of fenses and fish and game law violations. The judge, a graduate of Four Valley State College, is a slender woman with a prefer ence for up‐to‐date fashions like mini‐skirts and pants suits. She has gained a reputation for strictness, especially with traf fic violations. A number of truck drivers who reportedly gave Judge In gram “a lot of hp” have spent the night in the “county tank.” “You can see in some of their faces that they hate to come before a black person but there is just no place else for them to go in this county,” Judge Ingrain said. “But I suppose I'm hardest on drag racers— first offenders get a $100 fine and a 30‐day suspension of li cense and second offenders a $250 fine and a 90‐day suspen sion.” Local whites are apparently getting used to the idea of young black woman serving as ordinary, Judge Ingram says, for it is seldom nowadays that she has to insist that they call her either “judge” or “Miss In gram” instead of “Edith.” One white businessman con fided that while he had doubt ed at first that she would be fair to whites, he now consid ered her “fair to all.” Standing in front of his establishment in the city's small shopping dis trict, he volunteered that race relations in Sparta were “not too bad for this area,” but he cautioned against the use of his name. Leroy Wiley, the 34‐year‐old black clerk of the Superior Court, sees his own and Miss Ingram's roles as “helping black people lose their fear of going into county offices.” “We find they are taking an interest now, also, in politics, in government,” he said, “and they even seem to have less re sentment to paying taxes.” And although Hancock is one of the poorest counties in the nation, the community is look ing forward to far more eco nomic prosperity from the elec trical power station planned for the area by the Georgia Power and Light Company and from the $500,000 East Central Committee for Opportunity's Catfish Farm, which is expect ed to harvest some $250,000 worth of catfish annually. The 350‐acre fish farm, thought to be the largest in land commercial fishery in the world, is tied in with a $125,‐, 000 cement plant and a $90,000 concrete block factory, all owned by a cooperative of mostly poor county residents. John L. McCown, 35, leader of both the area's political and economic pushes, said the 15‐ month‐old fish farm “expects to harvest some 350,000 pounds of catfish this fall, set up a processing and freezing plant on the grounds and then open at least six fish‐and‐chip houses in Georgia and Florida in the next few months.” Miss Marian Fraleigh, who is white and, like Mr. McCown, a former antipoverty worker in rural Georgia, helped sell the catfish farming idea to the financial backers, the Federal Office of Economic Opportu nity and the Ford Foundation. She said the operation, which has some 320 acres of ponds bordering the Ogeechee River, would also try to involve many of the 300 county farmers in stocking their ponds with the fast‐growing fish for commer cial use. While some local whites have said they “would rather die” than join a predominantly black effort, she said, several white farmers have started to co operate. “Fish farming has been esti mated to earn a farmer from $150 to $350 an acre a year,” Miss Fraleigh said, “which is better than most any kind of farming—so whites are show ing an interest, bearing out the theory that it's money that changes things.” The rolling green hill country of Hancock County, some 60 miles east of Atlanta, has been a major cotton growing area for many generations. The ex haustion of its soil and the ex pense of mechanization forced many farmers in the area to abandon cotton for timber, “the new cotton.” Timber requires far fewer farm laborers, cutting deeply into the jobs local blacks had traditionally taken. “I picked more cotton than I care to remember,” said Ben Brundage, with just a hint of a laugh. “Then I went into the sawmill cutting pulpwood for some more white folks—we didn't own none of that.” Now, 49, this life‐long resi dent of Hancock County is in charge of feeding what Mr. McCown insists are 1.5 million catfish on the farm. Daily, Mr. Brundage pushes a heavily laden pickup truck along the roadways separating the rectangular ponds and throws buckets full of special, floating feed to the catfish, which rush to the surface to feed. “We work hard,” Mr. Brundage said, wiping his sweating brow with his sleeve, “everybody works hard here, helping out—but we own this.”

1212-> Charges for International Mail Revised
WASHINGTON, June 14 (UPI)—The United States Postal Service announced international rate changes today that will increase revenues by $20.6million a year but permit some reductions in airmail postage. The new rates will not affect mailings to servicemen overseas, or first class and airmail letters to Mexico and Canada, all of which remain the same as United States domestic rates. The principal provisions of the new rates, effective July 1, are as follows: ¶Airmail letters to Central and South America, the Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda and St. Pierre and Miquelon will increase from 15 to 17 cents a half ounce. ¶Airmail letters to other countries will be 21 cents half ounce—a 1‐cent increase over the present rate for letters to Europe and North Africa, but 4 cents less than those now prevailing for other countries. ¶Surface letter rates for all countries, except Canada and Mexico, will increase from 13 to 15 cents for the first ounce. ¶Air parcel post rates for all countries except Canada and Mexico will be increased 10 per cent. ¶Surface parcel post rates to Canada, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean will increase from $1 to $1.20 for the first two pounds and from 30 to 35 cents for each additional pound or fraction of a pound. ¶Surface parcel post rates to other countries will increase from $1.10 to $1.30 for the first two pounds and from 35 to 40 cents for each additional pound or fraction of a pound. International rates are set administratively by the Postal Service and are not subject to approval by the Postal Rate Commission, which must approve proposed domestic changes.

1213-> Valentino on Hand To Sell His Copies
Nobody was much con cerned with the forties' in fluence when Lord & Taylor previewed its Valentino copies the other day, not even Valentino. “Maybe it's because they see what they like,” the de signer murmured as he kissed cheeks, shook hands and watched customers dis appear into the fitting rooms followed by salesgirls with armloads of dresses. When he showed the orig inals in Rome two months ago, he was supposedly open ing the door to a widespread revival of the fashions of the forties — the button‐front dresses, the blazer jackets, the shirtwaist styles. The copies were accurate enough, but the customers simply weren't taking a his torical view. They considered the clothes contemporary. Besides, there was too much else to think about. There was spring in the air, shopping to do. And after all the somber shades in fashion lately, the bright red and white or navy and white color scheme looked lean and sprightly. “Except for the hair and the make‐up,” observed Mrs. Stuart Polydoris, who had flown in from Chicago with her daughter, Jeanne, aged 7, for a day of shopping, “the clothes look right for Lake Forest.” Like many of the other women who had been invited to meet the designer, sip some sherry and see the clothes modeled informally in the store's Contemporary Shop, she had gone straight to the fitting room. “They're just a bit long for the Middle West,” she said, eyeing a hem that stopped below her knees. “But they're not impossible,” she added. It was the store's seventh Valentino festival, the last three of them informal ses sions where the customers could meet the designer and try on the clothes. The copies ranged from $95 to $375, but apparently price was no object. The most expensive outfit was one of the fastest sellers. It was a long chiffon dress over a playsuit with a crepe top and sequined plaid shorts. Mrs. Ahmed Soudavar, the blond widow of an Iranian businessman, bought it along with another shorts and skirt evening outfit with a striped blouse at $140. Mrs. Stanley Tananbaum, whose husband is president of Yonkers Raceway, bought the spangled shorts as well as some plain navy ones, plus a narrow coat and a four‐piece suit. Even when the shorts weren't purchased they were good for conversation. Mrs. Soudavar was pleased with her shopping expedition, and not just because she had acquired two pairs of shorts. “I finally got to meet Valentino,” she said, as she buttoned up the beige fox collared coat she had bought in his Rome salon. “Such a charming man.”

1214-> 8 CHARGED IN LAOS WITH PLANNING COUP
VIENTIANE, Laos, April 8 (Reuters) — Eight persons, including several former highranking military officers, were reportedly under arrest today for their part in a proposed coup against the Laotian Government that was apparently called off at the last minute. Informed sources said that the plot against the Government of Prince Souvanna Phouma was conceived by former friend, Amphon Souvannabon, who now lives in Thailand after spending a number of years in Peking. They said the plan had been for a number of commandos to infiltrate Vientiane from Thailand across the Mekong River last Tuesday night. But they said the coup was apparently called off at the last minute because the plotters sighted police checkpoints being set up in the city and on the road leading to the ferry. It was said that the checkpoints, in fact, had been set up tots a routine measure.

1215-> ‘TIGER CAGE’ PRISON ATTACKED BY REID
WASHINGTON, April 8—Representative Ogden R. Reid, the ranking Republican member of the House Foreign Opertions subcommittee, charged today in letters to two Administration officials that the treatpent of Communist prisoners in South Vietnam represented a continuing violation of the Geneva Convention. In identical letters addressed to Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird and Dr. John A. Hannah, administrator of the AgenIcy for International Development, the Westchester Republican noted that Communist prisoners of war still remain at the maximum security prison on the island, Con Son, 60 miles off South Vietnam. Last July a Congressional investigation disclosed that political prisoners at Con Son were kept in small stone compartments known as “tiger cages” by the South Vietnamese authorities under a detention program financed and advised by the United States.

1216-> Bridge: Trump‐Support Requirements Set Unrealistic Limitations
In the early years of con tract bridge, textbooks were in the habit of Iaying down requirements for trump sup port. This was unrealistic, be cause the number of trumps needed for a raise Varies inversely according to the probable length of the suit that is being supported. Raises are made happily when the partnership is as sured of an eight‐card fit, and with less enthusiasm if seven cards are certain and eight are, possible. So if a player feels confident that his partner has at least a five‐card suit, he can in a pinch support with a doubleton. North was pinched in this fashion on the diagramed deal, which was played in the Men's Team Champion ship in the recent Spring Nationals in Atlanta. After two passes, South made the normal one‐heart opening bid—he was a frac tion too strong to consider one no‐trump—and West was able to crowd the bidding with a pre‐emptive jump to three diamonds. A negative double would be ideal with the North hand, indicating some length in the unbid suits, but using stand ard methods North had rest, problem. He was much too strong to pass, he could not bid no‐trump without a diamond stopper, and he could not introduce a four‐ card suit at such a high level. Three hearts was the least evil, for it was overwhelm ingly likely, from North's angle, that his partner held at least five hearts. Players who allow four‐card major openings, in the traditional style, seldom exercise this' option. When they do they usually have some length in diamonds, the next‐ranking suit, a possibility that North could exclude here on the basis of West's jump over call. South was Ronald Crown, who was one of New York's best‐known bridge teachers until he transferred his ac tivities to Palm Beach, Fla., recently. He naturally con tinued to game in hearts, and the play proved more difficult than he anticipated when the dummy appeared. On the first trick East's spade nine forced the de clarer's king, and he cashed the queen and king of trumps. It was a distinct shock to, South to find that West held five hearts as well as the long diamond suit he had indicated in the auction. South now planned to give West the lead at the right moment and force a diamond lead. Two more trump win ners left West‐with the nine, and it was clear that. West held at most one more black card and that it was vital to remove it. South was able to ensure success by leading a club. Even if West had been able to ruff, it would have done him no good for South would then have played the ten from dummy, a loser. When West followed, South won with the queen in dummy and played a spade toward his hand. East played the Jack to force the ace, and West tried to avoid the throw‐in by discarding a dia mond. But this only post poned the evil day, for South was left on lead in this pos sition: The lead of the last trump to West's nine not only forced a diamond return but also embarrassed East. He threw a diamond and was squeezed when his partner cashed the diamond ace and followed with the queen. South not only made his game but a useful overtrick to boot, The 11th trick would still have been available if West had not cashed the dia mond ace: A low diamond lead would have left East exposed to a throw‐in on his turn. • The Spring Tournament of the New Jersey Bridge League begins today at Es sex Green Plaza, West Orange, N. J.,

1217-> Books of The Times
Richard Harris has made a silk purse out of a banana peel. The nomination of a dim Florida jurist, G. Harrold Carswell, to the Supreme Court in January, 1970, and his rejection by the Senate 79 days later was the most ignominious fiasco, on the domes tic front, of President Nixon's first two years in office. As political slapstick, the story would almost write itself. Highlights: the initial puzzled hush at announcement of the nominee's name (“Who?”) is fol lowed by revelation of his 1948 statement that “segregation of the races is proper and the only practical and correct way of life in our states” and his flickering mem ory of his role as incorporator of a golf club seeking to avoid desegregation in 1956. Next, muddle and peevishness at the White House, with hasty consultation of “The Federalist” and the Constitution, bear fruit in a document known as the Saxbe letter, in which the President advises the Senate that “advice and consent” means it has the right of consent, only, to his nomination. DECISION. By Richard Harris. 220 pages. E. Dutton. $5.95. Many Senators aren't ecstatic over this lecture. But one of the faithful, Roman Hruska of Nebraska, tries to lend his Presi dent a helping hand with a wonderful ar gument: What if G. Harrold Carswell is mediocre, he asks—“there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a little representation, aren't they, and a little chance? We can't have all Brandeises and Frankfurters and Cardozos and stuff like that there.” Na tionwide hilarity. It still looks as if the nomination may go through, until the White House makes the panicky last‐minute blunder of trying to pressure waverers by claiming that Sen ator Margaret Chase Smith will vote favor ably. This dire miscalculation (to be dupli cated in 1971 over the SST) results in de feat, 51 to 45, followed by a gruesome display of Presidential temper and a low comedy coda: a post‐midnight call to The Arkansas Gazette from a woman identi fying herself as “little Martha Mitchell,” urging crucifixion of Senator J. W. Ful bright for his vote against Judge Carswell. “Decision,” which ran as a two‐part ar ticle in The New Yorker last December, turns this grubby farce into a searching study of the threat the Carswell nomina tion posed to two branches of the govern ment. Richard Harris makes us see that there was nothing at all hilarious about the Carswell incident, seen from the point of view of the Senate—which had just re jected the President's nomination of Clem ent F. Haynsworth to the Court and was of a mood to accept whatever name Mr. Nixon sent over next. “The Attorney Gen eral obviously believed that we had no stomach for another fight,” Mr. Harris quotes one Republican Senator, “and that we would accept any dog, so he took this opportunity to show his disdain for the Senate.” The nomination of a Southern “strict constructionist”—so far from strict in his interpretation of the Constitution, it soon developed, that nearly 60 per cent of, his published decisions had been reversed, more than twice the average of his fellow judges in the district courts—was a crude political move. The President was prepared, Richard Harris harshly says, “to insult one branch of the government, the Senate, in order to lower the quality and lessen the integrity of a second branch, the judiciary as symbolized by the Supreme Court, in order to give unequal power to, the execu tive—all for the purpose of bettering his own prospects for re‐election.” What to do about it? Even Senators most outraged by the nomination felt there was little hope of defeating it. The core of Richard Harris's book is the heartening, slow‐motion rise of indignation among Sen ators risking their political futures, matched by the rallying of thousands of lawyers. “Few lines of work make one less disposed to defy established authority than the law,” Mt. Harris notes; but in this case the law yers stirred—from Samuel Rosenman and Francis T. P. Plimpton in New York to small‐town committees in the sticks. By the time the Senate vote approaches, the reader has had a bracing lesson in the ways things can get done and how things work: the role of Senate staff assistants and lobbyists, how to arouse Hawaii by telephone. The climax is too intricate to describe here: There were two votings, one on Mon day on whether to recommit the nomina tion for reconsideration in committee (which would delay it forever) and a Wednesday final vote on confirmation. While the White House was concentrating on defeating the Monday motion, the anti Carswell forces had secretly shrugged that one off as lost and were concentrating on Wednesday: They had suddenly realized that Nixonites could fulfill their obliga tions by voting in the President's favor on Monday, while remaining free to rebuff him on Wednesday, and so they invited their own defeat on Monday. Richard Harris's account of this maneuver—which wasn't visible to newspaper readers at the time—is icily, nerve‐rackingly exciting, as is his spare account of the final Wednes day roll‐call. What a good reporter Richard Harris is, and what an exhilarating book he's writ ten! “Decision” won't be enjoyed much at the White House, nor at the Department of Justice under present auspices. Else where, yes.

STRAVINSKY is gone, but no great composer of history remains more eerily with us, thanks to that most mixed of blessings, 20th Century technology. Under his hand, or under his supervision, virtually everything he considered worthwhile was set down, mostly on Columbia recordings, and can be consulted by anyone curious as to how the artist himself thought his work should be performed. Columbia still has a few pieces to release before the jigsaw puzzle on Stravinsky is complete, and three such documentary items appear along with more familiar ones on Stravinsky Conducts Music for Chamber and ‐Jazz Ensembles. It is as entertaining a diskful as its title suggests. The most substantial new entry is the Concertino for 12 Instruments, which the composer arranged in 1952 from the 1920 Concertino for String Quaetet. The arrangement, in fact, is so extensive that this sounds almost like a new piece, and one possibly worth more frequent performance than the older string version. Less significant, but valuable in filling out the picture are the Pastorale, in a foreshortened version for violin and woodwind quartet of the 1907 piece for soprano and piano, which Stravinsky reworked several times; the Tango of 1940, in his 1953 orchestration of the piano piece that was the first work Stravinsky composed in America, and the peculiar little Preludium of 1937, a cheeky little study for dance band that lasts 86 seconds. Interest in such a musical snapshot as the Preludium lies mostly in its relationship to later, major works such as the Ebony Concerto, which also appears on this disk in the familiar Benny Goodman performance, along with previously released versions of Ragtime for 11 Instruments, and the Octet. By now, the documentation of Stravinsky as composer and conductor can only be a mopping‐up operation, so thoroughly has Columbia done its historic job. But even so, who knows Stravinsky the pianist? Seraphim, in its Great Recordings of the Century series, fills in that gap with four pieces that Stravinsky recorded in the Thirties. Once available on Columbia in 78 rpm, they have never before been released on longplay in this country. Included are the Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra, done in 1930 with Ernest Ansermet conducting; the Duo Concertant, with Samuel Dushkin as violinist, in 1933, and the Serenade in A and Piano Rag Music, in 1934. Except for the Capriccio, in which the orchestra sounds subaquatic, the reproduction (mono, of course), is remarkable, and Stravinsky's keyboard command and style are fully evident. There is a clipped preciseness but also a jauntiness to his playing that keep lightness and seriousness neatly balanced in the “Piano Rag Music.” And there is skillfully nuanced work in the collaboration with Dushkin. The Serenade, as Stravinsky liked to point out, was written specifically so that each of its four movements would fit on one side of a 10‐inch record, which meant under three minutes. But constriction always seemed to excite Stravinsky and, as this recording exists to remind us, his music often flowered best under restraints, not freedom. It was just such a peculiarly medieval and scholastic feeling about composing that set Stravinsky apart from the post‐Romantic era, and made him the most successful evangelist of neoclassicism. It is reassuring to hear in his piano playing direct reflection of his composing personality: here is an artist, plainly, who hates untidy thinking and messy displays of emotion. There is kind of ascetic strength to it that is not much in fashion at the moment, but will prob Hopping across three decades into the more confusing present, let's see what our brash contemporaries are up to. Deutsche Grammophon continues to enlighten American listeners about American experimental music, this time with a disk containing Lukas Foss's Paradigm (“for my friends”), Lejaren Hiller's Algorithms I, versions I and IV, and Elliott Schwartz's Signals. The Foss and Schwartz pieces are built out of word and phrase fragments, in chance combinations and in tightly controlled patterns. The Foss is high‐spirited and full of interlocking complexities that the performers may enjoy more than the listener, but then that is true of much good music. The use of splintered words and phrases, as if they were abstract musical materials, in fact, is an idea that many composers are playing with, often seemingly with no object but obfuscation but sometimes, as in Dieter. Schnebel's “Fur Stimmen” or Henze's “Cimarron,” with real dramatic impact. Hiller's work, given here in two of its four possible versions, for comparison, represents a pioneering effort in another currently popular direction: the use of computers in composing. Hiller, who was a chemist before he became a professional composer, worked out “Algorithms” on the IBM‐7094 and Illiac computers at the University of Illinois in 1968. The results are hard to take seriously as music, and un less the intriguing method were disclosed one would dismiss these tape plus instrumental pieces as plodding and laborious exercises. Another DGG disk, also in the Avant‐Garde series, couples Roland Kayn's Cybernetics III and Luigi Nono's Contrappunto Dialettico alla Mente. The Kayn piece is built, as the title indicates, with devices taken from information theory, and consists of electronic and vocal noises, filtered and transformed in a search for what the composer hopes are “new sound qualities.” Mostly, what we hear are the same old sounds unimaginatively manipulated. The Nono, whose title is translatable as “Dialectic Counterpoint for the Mind,” is more involving at every level. The political content in almost any Nono work insures it a careful listening, at least: Voices in this one call out in Italian for “liberty in Vietnam,” or in denunciation of the murder of Malcolm X. But Nono's musical instincts are sometimes as strong as his political ones, and out of all the tape manipulating, the fractured speech, the heavy breathing, the discussions between evidently brain‐damaged persons, the insane laughter and the rat‐like chittering comes a mood of angry menace that suits both the composer's esthetic and propagandistic purposes. Typically, too, the work is thickly layered with intellectual and musicological complexities (the four episodes are based on 17th Century madrigals by Andriano Banchieri); but it also grounds itself like many a purely musical work in commonplace sound materials (street cries of Venetian vendors, Venetian water noises and the bells of St. Mark's). The contemporary preoccupation with making natural but electronically distorted sounds and noises take the place of pitched‐note sequences and formal structures reaches its logical end in the work of a composer such as Luc Ferrari, a Parisian despite his Italian name. His Presque Rien No. 1 and Societe II appear on yet another DGG Avant‐Garde disk. Ferrari merely takes the musique concrete idea as its most literal, taping daybreak sounds on a beach, undis torted but edited down to 20 minutes so that a “fast motion” aural picture of an actual event results. Motorboats come and go, children yell, a woman chants something Moorishly melismatic, insects chirp and buzz—and eventually take over, in “Hellstrom Chronicle” fashion. This is amusing, and at brief moments even beautiful. But, unlike an actual 20 minutes at the beach at sunrise, “Presque Rien” seems interminably boring—literally almost nothing worth getting up early to experience. “Societé II,” less pure in method, is slightly more interesting. The piece, which Ferrari calls a “strictly conceived concerto for piano, three percussionists and 16 instrumentalists,” is subtitled “And if the piano were a woman's body.” Predictably, there is a lot of poking and caressing of the piano, along the lines of Ben Johnston's “Knocking Piece,” or earlier works of Henry Cowell, as well as suggestive trombone glissandos, quotes from Chopin waltzes, a circus‐band climax and a trailing off into exhausted noises at the finish. Without the subtitle, however, one might merely have remarked on the work's lavish free use of techniques familiar from better works of Berio, Cage, Penderecki and Stockhausen. The sex helps, but not enough to really matter.

1224-> Shop Talk
When Gloria Vanderbilt's book on collage appeared late last fall, the author found that a lot of other people were interested in putting bits and pieces together to make a decorative whole. And from that it was easy to think there might be a market for collage kits. Hallmark Cards, Inc., not only agreed with Miss Vanderbilt but asked her to design a number of other items such as jig saw puzzles, rec ipe files, gift wrapping paper, scrapbooks, cal endars, post cards, memoran dum pads and address books. Although the artist, in private life Mrs. Wyatt Cooper, is winding up her work, only the Christmas cards are to be offered to customers this year. But that is Hallmark's doing, not hers. “They work so far ahead,” she said not long ago when she was giving an informal preview of what she has ac complished for the greeting card company. “It seems strange to be dating some thing 1973.” (She was refer ring to the calendars.) The collage kits, when of fered early next year in Gloria Vanderbilt boutiques in Hallmark shops across the country, are to be $6 and jig saw puzzles are to be $3.50. The artist has taken many of the designs from her own paintings and collages. The Christmas cards, for instance, are derived from a collage called Silver and Blue Ma donna. They will cost $16.75 for 25 cards, $31.50 for 50 and $61 for 100. • Foreign folk art and crafts are the last thing one expects to find among quality gour met cookware, children's toys and tablewares, West Virginia tumblers and Finnish glasswares, Danish plastic bowls and French utensils. That's what helps set Marco Polo, 1052 Lexington Avenue (at 75th Street) apart from most of the neighborhood gift shops around town. And the prices are modest be cause Margaret Greenfield, the owner, does not add the plane fare to the cost of the merchandise. From Peru come the pot tery churches ($7 and $7.50), a small trunk with a scenic relief on the inside of the lid ($39) and pottery min strels, about 4 inches tall ($1.50 each). The Mexican papier mâché horses would be admired by, but should not be played with, adults and children alike. These fragile figures are $3.50 and $3.75. The Burmese lacquered crafts shown at the shop in clude boxes shaped like an owl and a pumpkin, and an open cup useful for holding cigarettes. They are $15 each. The shop is open from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Monday through Friday and 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Saturday. • Even the most avid needle work enthusiasts will find patterns that go beyond the abundance of design already available by visiting Bergdorf Goodman's new department. Louis J. Gartner Jr., who heads the shop that opened recently on the store's main floor, brings a fresh point of view to the field. His designs are rooted in modern textile and rug designs, an interest in shells and minerals (mala chite is his trademark) and an enthusiasm for patch work patterns and trompe l'oeil trickery. Mr. Gartner, the author of “Needlepoint Design” (Mor row, $15.95) is offering pat terns and wools for rugs, pil lows, tennis racquet covers, belts, slippers, handbags and gameboards. He has pillow patterns from $45 to $100, belts from $40 and rugs up to about $800. Mr. Gartner and his associate, John Mel ton, manager of the depart ment, will offer instruction and custom finishing.

1226-> 20,000 WALK OUT AT WESTERN UNION
Two unions representing 20,000 employes struck West ern Union today, halting the ac ceptance and delivery of domes tic telegrams, overseas cables and money orders across the country, the company said. The United Telegraph Work ers and the Communications Workers of America, both mem bers of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, struck at 12:01 A.M. after rejecting a company offer of a 20 per cent wage increase over two years. Four per cent of the raise offer hinged on Government aproval of higher tariffs. The unions broke off talks, demanding 31 per cent over two years. Western Union said that while it was closing its public offices, it would maintain Gov ernment communications serv ices, leased private wires, the Telex and TWX teleprinter serv ices, certain other automated electronic data and special com munications systems, and the “Mailgram” electronic message service operated with the post office. The. U.T.W. represents 17,000 teletype operators, clerks and installation and repair techni cians across the country The C.W.A. is the bargaining agent for 3,100 such workers in New York and New Jersey. What the company called its final offer was a 6 per cent raise effective June 1, with 4 per cent more if the Federal Communications Commission approved higher tariffs. An ad ditional 10 per cent would be added in the second year. A spokesman for the C.W.A. said its members now averaged $3.47 an hour. It demanded 18 per cent effective June 1 and 13 per cent more the following year. The U.T.W. negotiations, ex tending over six weeks, also involved pensions, a prohibition on contracting out workers, and restrictions on transfers.

1227-> Roundup: Phils Beat Slumping Reds, 2‐1 With Only 2 Hits
Sparky Anderson of the Cin cinnati Reds, addressing a sports forum in Philadelphia last week, said that there was nothing wrong with his team that a few victories wouldn't cure. After Cincinnati lost, 2‐1 to the Phillies last night in Phila delphia despite a two‐hitter, the manager must have won dered what it takes for his team to win. It was the 17th one‐run deci sion the Reds have played to. in 42 games this season, and they have only been able to win eight. When the Reds swept to the. National League pennant last season, things like that didn't happen very often. The hit that counted for the Phillies was their first one in the second inning by Denny Doyle—a two‐run homer off Gary Nolan who worked seven innings. It was the second home run of the season for the 27‐year‐ old Doyle and his fourth since he made the major leagues last year. The homer came with two out after Nolan had walked Deron Johnson to open the in ning. Since Doyle chose to finish college first, he didn't start in professional baseball until 1966, when he signed a Philadelphia contract and was assigned to Spartanburg (S. C.) in the West ern Carolina League. Until he got to Triple A com petition with Eugene (Ore.) in the Pacific Coast League in 1969, he also worked as a school teacher in order to sup port his family. Doyle batted .310 at Eugene and was brought up to Philadel phia last year where, hampered by a sore shoulder, he batted .208 for 112 games. Doyle's hit was the only one off Nolan, who Most his fourth game in seven decisions. Joe Lis, in the fifth, and Roger Freed, in the seventh, both walked and were the only other Philadelphia runners be fore Nolan left for a pinch hitter in the eighth. Rick Wise, who won his fourth game against two losses, held the Reds hitless for four innings, then yielded a run in the fifth on a single by Lee May, a double by Bernie Carbo and a sacrifice fly by Tommy Helms. The Reds put the leadoff batter on base in each of the last six innings, but Wise helped his own cause by starting two double plays. A two‐ run double by Orlando Cepeda in the fifth and a bases‐loaded double by Felix Milian in the ninth were the key hits in the Braves' 9‐4 triumph. Cepeda's home run, his 12th, broke a 3‐3 deadlock. Millan's two‐base hit was his second of the game. His other came in the fourth when his team took a 3‐0 lead. The Padres battered five Card pit chers, including Bob Gibson, the starter, for 14 hits and a 12.3 triumph. Clarence Gaston and Dave Campbell each bat ted in four runs. Lou Brock, who collected three hits in four trips to the plate, extended his hitting streak to 20 games. The Senators, in the Eastern Divi sion cellar, lost a five‐run first‐ inning lead, but bounced back for an 8‐6 victory that cut the Red Sox league lead over the idle Baltimore Orioles to 2½ games. Seventh‐inning doubles by Joe Foy and Paul Casanova broke a 6.6 tie and gave Joe Grzenda, the second of three Washington pitchers, his third triumph against one loss.

1228-> Noe Named N.Y.R.A. Race Secretary
Kenny Noe Jr. has accepted the post of racing secretary and handicapper for the New York Racing Association, it was announced yesterday by Alfred G. Vanderbilt, chairman of the board of the organization. Noe will assume the post that had been held by Tommy Trotter for the last 11 years. The 43‐year‐old Noe will resign as racing secretary and handicapper at the Garden State and Hialeah tracks and Trotter, who was relieved of his N.Y.R.A. duties in a sudden move by Vanderbilt last month, will take over those posts when his tenure here ends with the New York season on Dec. 15. Noe, who started out as a stablehand and assistant to his father, a former jockey and trainer, had been a trainer, racing secretary clerk, Florida state racing supervisor, patrol, paddock and placing judge, assistant racing secretary and steward before becoming a secretary‐handicapper. Among the tracks at which he worked were Atlantic City, Churchill Downs, Laurel, River Downs and Fort Miami in Toledo, Ohio. In 1962, Noe became racing secretary and handicapper at the Arlington Park, Washington Park and Balmoral meetings in Chicago and the following year he took the Hialeah and Garden State posts. A native of Hamilton, Ohio, he graduated from Canter bury College at Danville, Ind., with physical education and political science his main interests. He also served for three years in the Army. He is married and the father of a son, Jeff, 16, and a daughter, Holly Jo, 10. Trotter, is confirming his move to Hialeah and Garden State, said “the past 11 years with the New York Racing Association have been a wonderful experience and I will certainly leave behind many friends that I have made in that time.” Doctor Star Returns $121.40 A “wake‐up horse,” Doctor Star, gave the 18,532 fans a thrill of sorts when he came through to take the second race on yesterday's Aqueduct program at a payoff of $121.40 straight. Gene St. Leon, the 16‐year‐old, apprentice rider from Tampa, Fla., steered Doctor Star to a one‐length success over the runner‐up, Amberope, for his first victory in a dozen starts this year. Owned by Jacques Wimpfheimer, Doctor Star is a 3‐year‐old gelded New Yorkbred trained by Whitey Sedlacek. Doctor Star rounded out a daily double of $614.60. The front end of the big payoff was Lyford, who took the opening race under Laffit Pincay at $9.60. The feature race, a one‐mild test for 2‐year‐olds, went to John Dewitt Marsh's Eager Exchange, Jorge Velasquez riding. Eager Exchange had no trouble scoring by four lengths over Twin Angle and returning $7.20 as second choice in the field of 11.

1229-> Husband of Jersey Woman Is Held in Her Murder
PRINCETON, N. J., July 24— Colin C. Capir, the estranged husband of a 37‐year‐old wom an whose body was found in the East River in New York City on June 11, was arrested tonight and charged with his wife's murder. The dead woman, Mrs. Laura Muller Capir, had disappeared from her home here at 213 State Road on Feb. 8 after driv ing her four children to private schools in the area. Her partly clothed body, found in the river months later, was identified yes terday through dental records. Bruce M. Schragger, Mercer County Prosecutor, and Fred erick M. Porter, Jr., Princeton Township chief of police, issued a terse statement tonight indi cating that the 39‐year‐old in vestment broker had been ar rested and was being held with out bail. He is to be arraigned early next week. Authorities said that Mrs. Capir had been killed by a shot in the head from a 32‐caliber revolver. No weapon was re covered. The arrest came after more than a dozen persons, including Mr. Capir's secretary, Ruth Dirkes, 34 year old, who worked in his office at 148 Fariway Drive here, had been questioned for hours. Mrs. Capir, a daughter of James Miller, a wealthy Phila delphia banker, was separated from her husband in March, 1970. Mr. Capir, who is the son of the late Frederick Capir, execu tive vice president of the Penn Central railroad, submitted to two lie detector tests while being questioned. Mr. Schragger said that Mrs. Capir apparently was shot in the living room of her $500‐a‐ month rented house and that her body was then driven 50 miles to New York and dumped in the river.

1230-> Retraining Plan Proposed For Jobless L.I. Engineers
HAUPPAUGE, L.I, Feb. 14— The Long Island Association has offered the Suffolk County Economic Task Force a plan to retrain unemployed aerospace engineers for other professions. The Suffolk County Depart ment of Labor has reported that the county's unemploy ment rate has been over 6 per cent for the last seven months, and much of this is attributed to continued layoffs in the aerospace field. County Execu tive H. Lee Dennison appointed the task force three months ago to look into the county's economic problems. Harvey Losow, the association's director of manpower re sources, reported that “of an estimated nationwide total of 45,000 jobless areospace scien tists, approximately 7,500 are located on Long Island.” He said that “estimates of further Long Island, aerospace layoffs indicate the number will reach 15,000 by the end of 1971.” He proposed that the task force endorse and campaign for an initial retraining project and study program to be funded by the Federal Government at a cost of $2,375,000.

1232-> Seattle Blood Bank Cuts Cost and Risk of Infection
SEATTLE — When patients need blood here, their phy sicians say they get it for the least cost anywhere in the country and with a minimal risk of contracting hepatitis, a serious and sometimes fatal liver infection that is becom ing a growing national public health problem. Health officials say that the Seattle program's success stems from a combination of the attitude of doctors and citi zens, who regard human blood as a community asset and not as a commercial product for profit, and an efficient blood bank system that serves every one in greater Seattle's 32 hospitals. Seattle's blood bank system has an excellent international reputation. It is regarded as a model by some experts. In a widely acclaimed book, “The Gift Relationship,” pub lished by Pantheon Books of New York City, Prof. Richard M. Titmuss, a sociologist at the London School of Economics and Political Science, called the King County Central Blood Bank in Seattle “one of the best organized and effective blood banks” in the United States. When a patient needs a transfusion, several drops of his blood are put in a glass tube and sent to a blood bank laboratory for tests called “type and cross‐match.” This is to prevent the possibility of a fatal transfusion, reaction re sulting from mismatching the patient's and donor's blood. Mismatched blood can kill within minutes. Then, after tests are made to insure the compatibility of the donor's and patient's blood types, plastic bags of the donor's blood are sent by taxi cab to the hospital. In other cities, blood is gen erally collected and tested in each hospital, not in a central laboratory. Here, just a main laboratory and a smaller satel lite facility, both run by the private, nonprofit King County Central Blood Bank, do 120,000 tests for the transfusions needed by its residents and out siders who are referred as pati ents to its medical centers. Blood bank officials said that such centralized, nonprofit test ing eliminated the large profits that hospitals and doctors can make in other cities. Further, blood bank officials say they do not pay any donors, and are able to meet the entire comrnanity's needs without relying on commer cially acquired blood or the Red Cross' voluntary collec tions made elsewhere. Though voluntary blood banks that do not pay donors exist in many other cities, they do not meet the needs of their entire community as does Seattle's. The difference, doctors said, is that just one blood bank collects, tests and distributes all the blood for all the pa tients in all the hospitals in greater Seattle. By strict control over blood collection, the self‐sustaining Seattle blood bank says it can minimize the risk of hepatitis by screening out drug addicts who have a high incidence of the disease and who often sell their blood to buy drugs. The Seattle blood bank di rector, Dr. Dennis. M. Donohue, said in an interview that the bank charges $10.50 for a transfusion of red blood cells and $5.0 for one unit of AHG, the critical blood factor that Prevents hemophiliacs from bleeding to death. “Our charges are at least half of What they are anywhere else,” Dr. Donohue said, add ing, “I don't know of another American city that doesn't rely to some extent on paid donors.” In New York City, for a con trasting example, more than half of the blood transfused comes from paid donors, many of whom are drug addicts. Study after study has shown that the risk of a patient get ting hepatitis from a transfu sion is, up to 15 times greater if he receives blood obtained from paid rather than volunteer dondrs. A commercial concern that has no connections with the King County Central Blood Bank buys blood plasma from people in Seattle and sells it for use elsewhere in the country. So successful has, the Seattle program been that earlier this month officials dropped the $25 replacement fee that they had charged patients for each unit of blood they did not have replaced. This new action runs counter to a national trend of raising such fees. “We prefer to collect blood for blood rather than to col lect money,” Dr. Donohue said, and then, shrugging his shoul ders, added: “When you collect money in stead of blood, what do you do with the money?” Blood donation must be re garded not just as an indi vidual responsibility but also that of the entire community, Dr. Donohue said, and accord ingly, another state or the Red Cross cannot be expected to assume part of a local com munity's responsibility. “No patient has bled to death, countless lives have been saved and no surgery has had to be postponed under the Seattle system,” Dr. Donohue said. He concluded that a simi lar all‐volunteer donor system could be adopted by many other American cities.

1233-> Voluntary Ban on Pep Pills, Backed by Most Huntington Physicians, Is Spreading Through Suffolk
HUNTINGTON, L.I., July 24 —Dr. Melville G. Rosen of Deer Park is so convinced that am phetamines are unnecessary and hazardous for many pa tients that he has taken to pre scribing sugar‐coated aspirin for some who insist they need a pill to wake them up or sub due their appetites. Often, he says, the psycho logical value of such a placebo provides the lift the patient is seeking while inflicting none of the adverse side effects of the so‐called pep and diet pills. Recently, however, a careless pharmacist gave him away. The druggist told a woman with such a prescription that she really did not need such su gared aspirins. Furious, the patient confront ed the doctor. Gravely, he wrote out another prescription —equally substanceless—which the patient, to her immense re lief, then had filled. The story illustrates the stub born reliance of some patients on pills — and the equally stub born resolve of hundreds of physicians in this North Shore town and throughout Suffolk County to make a stand against America's drug culture. Although, according to tan es timate cited by a Suffolk phy sicians' Drug Abuse Task Force, 40 amphetamine pills are pro duced annually for every man, woman and child in America, the drug panel believes the pills are of questionable value in overcoming fatigue and curbing appetite because of possible dangerous side effect, such as dependency. The resistance was started May 5 with the sending of a letter by the Drug Abuse Task Force of the Suffolk County Medical Society to Huntington's 240 physicians asking them to sign a pledge not to prescribe amphetamines except for two specific ailments. More than half signed the pledge and only seven doctors came out in opposition. They cited the usefulness of the pills or objected to any restrictions on their judgment. The town's pharmacies did not object and many druggists endorsed the voluntary ban. The two exceptions to the ban were prescriptions for the treatment of narcolepsy, a sleeping sick ness, and hyperkinesis, a dis ease of intense overactivity in youngsters, for which some am phetamines have been found an effective treatment. In one indication of the ef fectiveness of the drive so far, the Village Pharmacy on Main Street, has reported that the number of amphetamine pre scriptions filled dropped from 19 in May to 10 in June. Four have been filled in the first half of July. The drive has provoked such a favorable response, accord ing to the Drug Abuse Task Force, that it has been ex tended countywide. Of about 1,100 Suffolk Coun ty physicians outside Hunting ton approached since June 9 to join the voluntary ban, nearly half have so far agreed and only 13 have refused out right, according to Dr. Rosen of the task force and a past president of the Suffolk Medi cal Society. Inquiries about starting simi lar programs have come from as far away as California. Flushed with their early success, task force members contemplate a campaign in September to cut down on the prescribing and dispensing of barbituates, tranquilizers and, perhaps, eventually on the use of alcoholic beverages. They are even considering a ban against the use of alcoholic beverages. Members concede, however such widely used drugs, which have recognized status in treat ing some ailments, will be far more difficult to restrict. What is giving the partici pating physician particular satisfaction is the realization that—as Dr. Milton Gordon, education chairman of the task force, noted—physicians here have assumed a leadership in the antidrug‐abuse movement that had long been held by social workers and self‐styled experts. Nevertheless, the drive here has its critics. One is Dr. Cy ril Drysdale of Northport who declined to sign the pledge. “Signing it makes us look like we're responsible for the abuse,” he asserted. Besides, he added, “here we are in heroin up to our eyebrows and it's been outlawed—we don't dispense it—so you can see the fault doesn't lie with us.” Even leaders of the task force concede that the illicit trade in amphetamines relies on pills from stolen phamaceutical shipments. “It's a moral issue,” Dr. Gor don said. “Even if they can get the pills elsewhere, it doesn't relieve us of our moral obligation.” For Huntington's youthful drug takers, the drive against amphetamines has had little impact since, as Richard Hen riksen, an 18‐year‐old ex‐ad dict and member of the town's youth board put it—“Summer time is acid [LSD] time.” Amphetamines, he added, have never been widely used in Huntington and when they were it was usually in the winter, the supply coming from parents' medicine cabinets. The most popular drug around now, according to a group of outgoing young people gathered in Heckscher Park, is —as might be expected—mari juana and hashish. Asked how far they would have to walk to get some, a 13‐year‐old girl named Kathy replied with an enigmatic smile, “Maybe right where you're standing.” The young people gen erally agreed that they avoided using heroin and methedrine, or speed, because of their ad dictive and otherwise powerful side effects. However, they said they found nothing wrong with smoking marijuana, “pop ping” pills or taking the hal lucinogenic drug LSD “if you can handle it.” Taking drugs, asserted a 17‐ year‐old named Gary who wore a T‐shirt marked “cocaine,” “is like when adults take a couple of drinks and go to the movies —it's entertainment.” They complained that there was little else to do for amuse ment in Huntington. Meanwhile, according to Dr. Rosen, although Suffolk and Nassau have the only county narcotics commissions in the state, Suffolk facilities remain woefully inadequate to deal with the over‐all drug abuse problems, particularly the No. 1 concern—heroin. The police say they know the names of 2,000 heroin users in the county and the total number of users is esti mated to run up to four times that. However, Dr. Rosen said, there is only one outpatient methadone treatment facility in Suffolk and its 130‐patient ca pacity is already more than matched by a waiting list of addicts who are willing to give up heroin, but cannot find a treatment center to take them. In the meantime they continue to steal to support their habit. Dr. Rosen said he was trying to mobilize legislative support for a $2.2‐million appropriation in the county budget to fight drug abuse this year—up from about $300,000 now—“but the legislators are ducking It—I just can't get them on the phone.” The money, he said, was needed for eight new metha done facilities treating up to 1,000 addicts each with daily doses of the heroin substitute. While proud of the drive against amphetamines, Dr. Ro sen said that the heroin prob lem pushed any other drug problem to a distant second place. “It's like a splinter com pared to a bleeding artery,” he said.

1234-> Murtaugh Switches Hospital for Tests
PITTSBURGH, May 24 (UPI) —Danny Murtaugh, manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who must make another decision whether to continue his career, entered Presbyterian‐University Hospital here today for inore tests. The 53 ‐ year ‐ old pilot was, discharged earlier in the day from Christ Hospital in Cincin nati where he had been under treatment since last Thursday for pains in the chest and arms. He was not expected to rejoin the Pirates for several days, and Bill Virdon, the batting coach, will continue to carry on for him. Murtaugh said last night he felt “pretty good,” but declined to say whether he would be in uniform again. A few years ago he was forced to step down because of a heart condition. He returned as an interim manager when Harry Walker was dismissed., But in 1969 he was back at scouting duties. Before the 1970 season opened he took over the manager's post when doctors declared he was fit. Last year the Pirates won the National League Eastern Division championship in a grueling three‐way race. As the season drew to an end, Mur taugh appeared tired and worn and took frequent long naps. But the pennant race appears hectic again and Murtagh must decide whether he should keep going. After the Priates beat Montreal last Tuesday night in the ninth inning, Murtagh confided to friends that “these games are tough on my boiler.” He was admitted to the hospi tal two days later. A cardiologist in Cincinnati said there was nothing seriously wrong with Murtaugh, but or dered the hospital rest and a series of tests. Joe L. Brown, the Pittsburgh, general manager and a close friend of Murtaugh, said he ex pected his manager would step down if it became necessary for him to rest at intervals during the season because of health. Murtaugh was manager of the year in 1958, when the Pirates finished second, again in 1960, when they won their first world championship in 35 years and in 1970, when they took the Eastern crown.

1235-> A Late Education
It was in the Bar Basque at St. Jean de Luz, on the fringes of the Spanish Civil War, that the nervously ambitious young newspaperman from Australia met the taciturn English man and asked the way. The one was Alan Moorehead and the other Alexander Clifford. It would be fitting to record that there was instant recognition of a strange rapport, the special compati bility that was to make their later relationship so strong and celebrated. On the contrary, Alex Clifford greeted Moorehead churlishly, and Moorehead cherished the snub. Over 14 years to come, while the world blundered into the bigger war, and through it, and eventually somehow out the other end, the two reporters grew into a friendship that was al most an identification, over and above the usual colleagueship of cor respondents who covered those many battlefields. The Moorehead‐Clifford axis became almost legendary to those of who knew them. This is the theme of Alan Moore head's small and touching book, “A Late Education.” I have reason to value it, as I knew them both in the brave days of their association, and shared the sorrow when it came to an end. It is odd, though understandable, that Alan Moorehead, who has pro duced so many excellent and impor tant books on military history, Africa, his own Australia, who is by any standards one of the senior diarists of our time, has never written a seri ous autobiography. Awaiting the ma jor one, this will have to do—frag mentary and elusive as it is, exas peratingly cavalier with continuity, leaving undefined so much one wants to know. It emerges as what it was surely meant to be: an almost diffi dent memoir of two men's friendship over a world at war. There is a good deal more to it than that, of course: the galling schooldays in Australia, the young beginner on The Melbourne Herald, the escape to London at 26 into the hallucinatory prewar scene of Europe in the thirties; the evocations of its impact on the raw colonial boy are among the best things Alan Moore head has written, which is saying something. But after that first brief encounter in the Bar Basque every thing is informed by and centered round the 14 years of comradeship with Clifford. It has to be said that they made an odd couple. “We were the most complete of opposites. If you found an epithet for Alex then its anti thesis almost certainly applied to me.” This was true, but they were almost certainly complementary op posites. Alex was big; Alan short; Alex precise and pedantic; Alan er ratic, aggressive, full of terrier en thusiasms, eaten by the curiosities of the naif Australian, while Alex re treated into his European intellectual izations, his music, his talent for lan guages, his deep abiding pessimism for the world and for himself. “I cannot think that we fundamen tally altered each other's natures, but as time went on it is certainly true that I absorbed a little of his preci sion, his reticence, his quite extraor dinarily cerebral approach to life. And perhaps he on his side found in me many of the things that were wanting in himself.” Whatever the truth of that, they became — working as they were on ferociously competitive newspapers, Alan for the Express, Alex for the Mail—an almost indissoluble unity in the mad contending folk‐dance of in ternational war correspondents. Those of us who have served our time in that curious trade know the nature of these capricious associa tions—of shared tedium and danger, of exhilaration and fatigue, of disen chantment, of cooperation and rival ry, the occasional tiny triumph among the frustrations and the fear. It was not all the time a pas‐de deux. Arriving at the other side of his world at its great watershed, the days of the Spanish War, Alan Moore head was flung into the trauma at the deep end; I shared the baptism of that period and recognize his nuan ces only too well. He has a tour de force of a chapter on a most eerie trip from Turkey on a tanker smug gling oil into Valencia, contending with everything from an evil ship to an amorous captain, which is straight out of Eric Ambler. He writes of Bernard Berenson, of the murderer Eugene Weidman, of Ernest Heming way, of Paris and London and Gibral tar and Florence. But mostly he writes of Alex. To reporters of our generation, which is now going or gone, Alan Alex (it fluctuated; sometimes it was Alex‐Alan) was the Middle East, the Desert War of North Africa. This was the blooding, I suppose, where the necessities of coming to terms with professional rivalry in the middle of inescapably mutual difficulties forged this identification which in the end became love. It endured after the war, after the Eclipse, with Europe pulling its fragments wretchedly to gether, fretfully cobbling up new re conciliations, new fears, new hates, new loyalties, new follies. Alex Clif ford saw his forebodings confirmed; Alan went to bypass them in Tus cany. The long dialogue of the Bar Basque ended in London in 1952, with Alex Clifford's death of linger ing incurable disease, sustained at the end not by the church (“It didn't work”) but by the brief consoling ecstasy of mustard‐gas and quick ob livion. Alan Moorehead the journalist has described many things with en viable definition, but nothing so tender as this. And with no word at any time of the dire sickness that Alan himself had later so long and bravely to face. An old colleague can only say: R.I.P. Alex, and viva Alan. ■

1236-> Trade War At Airports Stirs Berlin
BERLIN, May 1 (AP)—A busi ness war is under way between airports in East and West Ber lin. East Germany is seeking to attract airlines to its spacious field at East Berlin‐Schönefeld. It has an advantage since it controls all air approaches to West Berlin except three re stricted corridors from West Germany. Those corridors opened after World War II and, supervised by Western powers, have de veloped into a monopoly for United States, British and French lines. Other airlines need permis sion to penetrate East Germany in order to fly outside the cor ridors to West Berlin. There is little prospect that the Com munists will grant such per mission so long as the East Berlin regime is not recognized by the West. Consequently, several airlines have expressed growing inter est in landing at Schonefeld. Officials in West Berlin fear they will lose business. “It will be more and more difficult to keep airlines, espe cially from neutral nations, from using East Berlin‐Schön efeld if they cannot land in West Berlin, a West Berlin city government source said. With airline profits down, the attraction of a possible Ber lin bonanza along Central Eu rope's natural north‐south, east west axis, has moved some air lines to action. The Dutch airline KLM be gan an “on demand” serv ice between Amsterdam and Schiinefeld this month. A spokesman called it an “un publicized, irregular service.” This means that if passen gem are waiting in East Berlin or Amsterdam they will be put aboard KLM's Amsterdam Moscow flight, which will land at Schonefeld. A Swedish source says that the Scandinavian airline SAS is ready to use Schönefeld, but no decision on a start has been made. Airline sources add that Ali talia and Swissair also are in terested in starting some sort of Berlin service. West Germany's Lufthansa has sought West Berlin landing rights for its imminent Mos cow‐to‐Frankfurt flights. Ap parently Lufthansa cannot get allied permission to use the air corridors and the Russians in sist the West Germans deal with the East Germans directly. A West Berlin spokesman, said some five million people will use the Berlin airways this year. Half of all travel in and out of West Berlin is by air. “The great danger,” one offi cial said, “is that West Berlin will become a dead end with only feeder traffic to and from West Germany while East Ber lin tries to take over transit traffic to points beyond Ger man borders.”

1237-> Bon Vivant's Canned Food Is Being Recalled by U.S.
WASHINGTON, July 7—The Food and Drug Administra tion and the Department of Agriculture ordered today the recall of all soups, sauces and other canned foods made by Bon Vivant Soups, Inc., of Newark. The action was taken be cause of the discovery that at least five cans of Bon Vivant vichyssoise were contaminated with deadly botulinum toxin, the cause of botulism. The Government announce ment today also confirmed the link between the canned vichys soise and the death last week of a Westchester County, N. Y., man and the serious illness of his wife. The announcement said the action to recall the food prod ucts is being taken because of the continued finding of defec tive cans. Although the Government has identified only the vichys soise as having been contami nated, the recall applied to all canned products made by Bon Vivant, including many sold under other labels. Botulism is caused by a toxin, produced by bacteria called clostridium botulinum, which grow in the absence of oxygen. If a can is contaminated with the germ, the fact that the can has not been opened is no protection. The F.D.A. advised consumers to avoid using any cans of food that appear to be swollen. Although no toxin has been found in any of the company's other products, the announce ment said, defective cans have been found in other of its product lines. For that reason the recall has been made general. The drug agency said the company had agreed to the total recall and was cooperating fully to expedite stock with drawals. Dr. Charles C. Edwards, Commissioner of Food and Drugs, said the deadly toxin had been found in five of cans of the vichyssoise bearing on its label the code number V‐141/ USA 71. The Department of Agricul ture is understood to be taking part in the recall action be cause it has responsibilities for some food products containing meat, such as Bon Vivant chicken a la king and lamb stew products. The F.D.A. said today that of the 6,444 cans of vichyssoise bearing the code V‐141/USA 71, there were 1,731 cans in the New York‐New Jersey area still unaccounted for; 185 in Philadelphia and 294 in the Baltimore‐Washington area. The drug agency has tested 324 cans bearing the V‐141/ USA 71 label and has found the deadly toxin in four of them. A fifth can was the one that killed the man in Westchester County. All four cans tested by the F. D. A. were found in one retail store in the Bronx. The announcement said the fifth can was tested by the New York State Department of Health and proved to contain botulinum toxin in type A, the same type found in all of the other four cans. Dr. Edwards said today that he hoped that none of the other products marketed by the com pany were contaminated, but, he said, all must be recalled as a precaution to protect the pub lic health and safety. Botulism is one of the most deadly types of poisoning. Mor tality may be as high as 65 per cent of cases of the poisoning. Most of the fatalities occur be tween the second and ninth days after the person has con sumed food or drink contami nated with the toxin. The onset of symptoms is usually abrupt, beginning 18 to 36 hours after eating the poi soned material. Among the earliest effects are difficulty with vision and dimunition of the eye's reaction to light. Symptoms of paralysis and ina bility to swallow follow. Bon Vivant makes 52 varie ties of soup, nine types of gourmet sauces and 14 other products. Last Saturday, after New York State had detected the botulinum in the company's vichysoisse, Dr. Hollis S. In graham, State. Commigsioner of Health, said that all of the company's products should be regarded with suspicion. The man who died from the poisoning was Samuel Cochran Jr., of Bedford Village. At Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, in New York City, the condition of his wife was still listed as critical. A spokesman said she was suffer ing from paralysis of the eye muscles and of the intestinal tract and was breathing only with the aid of a respirator. He said that after several weeks of a “serious” stage of illness her paralysis could be expected to disappear. Meanwhile, in Newark, the Food and Drug Administration released a list of products made by Bon Vivant under other labels. An agency official said that the label's named might also have the same products packed by companies other than Bon Vivant and that these products were not necessarily tainted. But, the agency said, con sumers and retailers would have no way of discerning which were packed by Bon Vivant. It said that Bon Vivant pro duced about four million cans of various food products a year, with distribution in the United States and abroad. In releasing a list of products and labels connected with the Bon Vivant company, the, F.D.A. said that it was complete “to the best of our knowledge,” but that “we cannot guarantee 100 per cent accuracy at this time.”

1240-> The Nation
WASHINGTON—It might have seemed just another exercise in the mysteries of high finance. But the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund here last week—held in an atmosphere of crisis—was in fact of potential consequence to the working man and his employer all over the world. These were some of the concerns: • The impact of the monetary crisis on jobs, prices and company profits, which can depend to a great degree on the international exchange rate of a nation's currency. For example, there was private talk at the meeting of possible bankruptcies of major German companies and even a general recession as a result of the loss of export business following the recent rise in the value of the mark. • The possible frustration of world trade by outright trade barriers, such as the new American import surcharge. Millions of persons around the globe depend upon trade for their livelihood. • The effect on foreign relations, particularly for the United States. Increasingly, economic matters, and American actions in this area, are coming to be dominant factor in foreign policy. The meeting, of course, also was unavoidably concerned with such matters as “floating” exchange rates, the price of gold, subtle trade barriers. The finance ministers were invited to the White House on Wednesday by the man who, with a single blow on Aug. 15, had broken up the old system of rules by which nations had dealt financially with one another. President Nixon did so by ending the convertibility between the dollar and gold and suddenly imposing a 10 per cent import surcharge. Mr. Nixon told the finance ministers what he obviously believes: That there is a real threat of “isolationism” in the United States; a United States that is “weak economically is sure to be isolationist” and that only an economically strong United States can continue its “world role.” It is not known how his remarks were received. There was no lack of understanding at the I.M.F. meeting of this country's problem, which essentially is a long‐standing, and worsening, deficit in its international balance of payments. But there was also anguish at the results of Mr. Nixon's actions. The French Finance Minister, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, began his speech in these terms: “The job of political men is to deal with the future. We are not here as historians. What had to happen has happened. We are not gathered here, as at Pompeii, to visit the ruins of the international monetary system and ask the guide about the circumstances of the catastrophe, but to seek together the conditions for re‐establishing monetary order, acceptable to all.” Rodrigo Llorente Martinez of Colombia said simply, “Without any control or discipline, the mighty have shown themselves to be weaker than ever. . . I must stress that whereas the industrialized countries are chiefly affected by their own economic policies, the developing countries feel not only the effects of their own decisions but also, which is far more damaging, the consequences of policies adopted by the more prosperous nations.” The meeting settled nothing, and was not expected to. World traders, tourists and investors will be as uncertain about the exchange rate between the Swedish kroner and Japanese yen tomorrow morning, for example, as they were last Monday. But there was no despair. Nearly everybody agreed that there is a short‐run problem of restoring a fair degree of certainty to international money exchange and trade—above all by restoring relatively fixed exchange rates among currencies, which are now in many important cases “floating” and changing in value from day to day—and a longer‐term problem of remaking the world monetary system itself. Probably the most heartening aspect of the I.M.F. meeting was the extraordinary degree of agreement on the main principles of the longer‐term problem. With Britain taking the lead, nation after nation stood up to support a world system not dependent, as in the past, on the American dollar as a currency to be held in the monetary reserves of other countries. The main hope, apparently, is to be the new “paper gold,” formally known as special drawing rights. or S.D.R.'s, which is a “manmade” monetary asset created in measured amounts by the I.M.F. and held by central banks. By implication, Secretary of the Treasury John B. Connally accepted the point: “After 25 years, international monetary stability can no longer depend so heavily on a single nation.” But the short‐term problem was another matter. German and Japanese exporting companies, for example, are said now to be declining orders because they have no idea of how much, and in what currency, they will be paid. A number of countries cited their fear that continued uncertainty will soon begin to mean reduced business and reduced jobs. An agenda for negotiations among the “group of 10” leading industrial countries has been agreed upon, but not much more. Mr. Connally suggested that the United States would remove its detested import surcharge if the other leading nations genuinely and without manipulation let the foreign exchange markets “float” their currencies upward against the dollar—and removed a few restrictions against American exports—but it was far from clear that most other countries would along with this idea. Mr. Connally did not say what trade restrictions he had in mind. He will probably press for removal of still more quota and other restrictions in Japan, as one example of an action that could be taken quickly. The drama—with jobs and incomes at stake in many countries —is only in the first act. The outcome is unknown, but the spirit of international cooperation, so far, has survived.

1242-> Impact of Sickle Cell Anemia Fight Grows
Some years ago. Mrs. Dina Jacobs, a Brooklyn house wife, spent several weeks visiting physicians before she found a doctor who cor rectly diagnosed the cause of her year‐old son's recurrent colds and severe joint pains. After administering a blood test that was simple but not widely publicized then, a physician at Kings County Hospital discovered that the boy, Samuel Jacobs, suffered from the complica tions of sickle cell anemia, a hereditary disease that oc curs commonly among blacks and Puerto Ricans. If not con trolled, it can be fatal. The odd‐shaped red blood cells that are characteristic of the disease have been studied since 1910 by scien tists interested in molecular biology. But investigation of the medical aspects of the illness, for the most part, started only in the last few years. Interest was spurred by the general rise of concern about problems specific to urban ghettos, according to Dr. David Westring, a hema tologist at Brooklyn‐Cumber land Medical Center. This new awareness is having a widespread impact on medical practice in Brook lyn and throughout the country. This month Brooklyn‐Cum berland began a screening program to detect the illness and also a clinic for the treatment of victims in the Fort Greene section. The sickle cell clinic at Kings County Hospital, which serves Central Brooklyn, was a year old in June. St. Mary's Hospital has a treatment pro gram and has prepared 6,000 copies of a 15‐page pamphlet on the disease for distribution in the neighborhoods it covers in sections of Crown Heights and Bedford‐Stuy vesant. Other Brooklyn institu tions, such as Long Island College Hospital in South Brooklyn, regularly check for sickle cell in standard blood tests. To support research in the disease, a Brooklyn chapter of the Association for Sickle Cell Anemia, situated on Pit kin Avenue, raises money through card parties and automobile raffles. Mrs. Jacobs is now secretary of the 40‐member group, which was founded last year. On a national level, the Federal Government appro priated $1‐million for re search last year, and plans to spend $6‐million next year. Researchers are looking for a simple drug that will ef fectively control the here ditary disease in much the same way that insulin con trols diabetes. The clinic at Kings County, which is a model for other clinics in Brooklyn, operates with funds from the hos pital's department of hema tology. It is staffed by three doctors, a public health nurse and a social worker. The clinic regularly sends technicians out into the com munity to administer blood tests and checks the blood of all patients in the hos pital's pediatrics service. While sickle cell anemia is not curable, early detection is important because the ef fects of the disease can usually be contained. Sicklers tend to be slug gish and underweight. The symptoms of the disease vary from patient to patient, but they can include harsh pains in the joints, degeneration of the bone structure, ulcerated skin and low resistance to infection. These symptoms are prob ably all caused by poor delivery of oxygen to the body tissue, researchers say. Treatment of the illness includes the occasional use of narcotics to relieve pain and a well‐balanced diet to offset weight loss. Most victims used to succumb to massive infections by the age of 20, but such infections can now be controlled by anti biotic therapy. Mrs. Jacobs's son, Samuel, for example, is now a cheer ful six‐year‐old. “About the only thing I have to watch out for is that he doesn't play too hard,” Mrs. Jacobs said. Sicklers can attend school and work at normal office jobs, but they should not exercise excessively, espe cially at high altitudes where oxygen is limited. Two black soldiers stationed at Fort Bliss, Tex., died recently after overexertion. Their deaths were attributed to the illness. An important part of the treatment of the ailment is family counseling. Every Tuesday the Kings County clinic runs a seminar for pa rents of patients. Open discussions help re lieve the sense of guilt many parents feel when they find their child has a hereditary disease, said Dr. Margaret Robinson, who directs the hematology service in the pediatrics wards at Kings County. The talks also dispel many of the myths that have sprung up in the black community concerning the origins of the ailment. Two common beliefs, which can tend to break up the families of anemia vic tims, are that the disease is venereal in origin, and that it is the fault of one parent. “The fathers usually blame the mothers,” Dr. Robinson said. “It's typical male chau vinism.” Sickle cell anemia is caused by two simple recessive genes. For a person to have the disease, he must inherit a gene bearing the trait from each parent. Scientists esti mate that one black person in 10 carries a single sickle cell gene in all his body cells. These people do not have sickle cell anemia, but if they marry a person who also has the trait, about one‐quarter of their offspring will have the anemia. The incidence of sickle cell anemia—that is persons hav ing two of the defective genes—is one black in about 400. Doctors estimate that of the 600,000 blacks in Brook lyn, 60,000 are probably car riers, while 1,500 are victims of the anemia. So far about 500 sicklers have been de tected at hospitals in Brook lyn. The incidence of actual sickling in the Puerto Rican population is not known, but doctors estimate that 6 per cent are carriers, Dr. Robin son said. The sickle cell genes ap parently create an abnormal ity in the structure of the hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells. Oxygen travels through the blood stream attached to the hemoglobin molecules. The abnormal molecules in turn distort the shape of the red blood cell from its normal circular pattern into a crescent, or sickle‐like shape, in the anemia victim. Ironically, victims of the anemia are relatively immune to malaria. Scientists be lieve that this may explain why the tendency for the disease has survived in the population whose ancestors came from malarial‐infested regions.

1243-> Baird Puppets Give ‘Wizard of Oz’
The Bil Baird Theater on Barrow Street is one of the coziest, most comfortable little theaters in New York. The stage is raised so that viewing is easy no matter how small the child or how distant the seat. Mostly, Bil Baird presents new versions of children's classics—“Win nie the Pooh,” “Peter and the Wolf” (opening next month) and, beginning this past weekend, a return engage ment of “The Wizard of Oz.” Baird's “Wizard of Oz,” as re‐staged by Gordon Hunt, is one of his more entertaining productions, particularly be cause its source is not only L. Frank Baum's book but Harold Arlen's and E. Y. Har burg's score. This is something of a tab, or pocket, version of the movie—both short and inti mate. The emphasis is on Dorothy and her three trav eling companions. Spectacle is minimized. There is a tiny twister, no crowd scenes, and the Yellow Brick Road is all in the mind (and in the words of the song). One has to imagine detail — which makes this show much more stimulating, for instance, than Baird's elaborate “Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves.” The musical is followed by a mini variety show featuring a Spike Jones‐type of band playing objects as instru ments, puppeteers in masks as life‐size puppets, and a brief demonstration of basic puppet‐making. It is the dem onstration, even more than the main event, that arouses the audience to vocal, and active, participation.

1244-> Britain Decimalizes the Pound to 100 New Pence
LONDON, Feb. 15—For a thousand years the English pound has been divided into 240 pence. Today Britain went decimal, dividing the pound into 100 pence. The British took the change much more easily than the experts had expected. Some cashiers complained about “bloody decimals,” but very few were so confused that long lines built up. The London subways, British Rail, the banks and the stock exchange all went deci mal without difficulty. The only thing that worried them a little was that business was light, perhaps indicating that some customers stayed home. “I shall keep my fingers crossed until after the week end,” said Lord Fiske, chair man of the Decimal Currency Board. But then, radiating the confidence of a man with the nondecimal enemy on the run, he added: “If I were a military commander, this is the stage where I would send in the cavalry.” The real threat of confu sion probably lies ahead—in the fact that the old currency will he accepted in some places for the next 18 months. That is the transition period that has been fixed, though it may be shortened if people simply stop using the old coins, as is possible. The old currency, the most complicated in the world, di vided the pound into 20 shillings and the shilling into 12 pence. With the pound at $2.40, that meant each Eng lish penny was worth exact ly one American cent. Now the pound is divided into 100 new pence, each worth 2.4 American cents. Today three new copper coins appeared to provide the small change. There is a 2‐penny piece, a little bigger than an Ameri can quarter, and a new penny similar to a United States cent. That is a big switch from the huge old copper penny. The average weight of coins is cut by more than half. It is not a totally decimal system, actually, since there is also a new halfpenny a tiny thing that feels like play money. It is being ignored by the banks and vending ma chines, and some think it will not last long. Inflation could doom it. The new coins Will circulate alongside old pennies, three pences and sixpences. An old shilling is exactly the same as 5 new pence, since it was the 20th part of a pound, and a 2 shilling piece is the same as 10 new pence. Even a mathematician could lose his way with pockets full of both currencies. For an elderly woman at Harrods or dering a glass of carrot‐and watercress juice, it was under standably forbidding. The juice used to cost 4 shil lings 8 pence. The nearest equivalent in the new money is 23½ pence. “Oh, dear,” the woman said, and fished into her pocketbook for a pound note. That is what the decimal currency board rec ommends when in doubt: give a pound or large coin and get decimal change. About 80 per cent of all shops went decimal today and henceforth will not accept the old money except in amounts that add up to exact equivalents of the new. But some will take a long time to change. London taxis will take up to two years, because the meter adjusters are so busy. Telephones, which take six‐ pences and shillings now, will have the coin slots changed to take the new 2‐penny piece. That will be a bargain—for a slightly shorter call—but many other coin machines will go up, for instance from sixpence to a shilling (5 new pence). It will also cost more to “spend, a penny.” Public toilets will rise new cost from one old to one new penny. Prices are a big concern with the public. There is a suspicion that merchants will use the occasion of decimalization to slide prices up. For some prices it is a matter of luck in the nearest whole decimal. Thus The Sunday Times, which was 1 shilling and threepence (15 old pence), goes down to 6 new pence (14.4 old). The Guardian goes up from 9 old pence to 4 new pence (the equivalent of 9.6 old). After all the centuries of com plication, not all will be simpli fied quickly. One man was talk ing with a lawyer about a problem today and asked what the fee would be. The answer was 125 guineas. Guineas, worth 1 pound 1 shilling, have not existed for many years; but expensive shops and doctors and lawyers have quoted their prices in guineas. They are not supposed to do so now, but it will be a hard habit to break. Incidentally, 125 guineas works out to £131.25. The actual figures will be much easier for foreigners to read under the new system. What used to be written as £3 12s 7d becomes £3.63. Plantagenet Palliser would have been delighted with the whole thing. Palliser, a central figure in Anthony Trollope's political novels, was the sad Prime Minister who spent much of his ‐ time worrying about how to decimalize the currency. Trollope's use or the issue is only a slight indication of the history behind it. The pound and 240 pennies have been in use here since the ninth cen tury, and efforts to change to decimal currency have gone on for more than 300 years. As of today, only three coun tries in the world have non decimal currencies — all in herited from British colonial days. They are Malta Gambia and Nigeria, and the first two have announced plans to change. The Republic of Ireland made the switch today along with Britain. Despite her independ ence, and all the troubles in neighboring Northern Ireland the republic is actually tied closely to Britain in monetary and other matters. The transition is going to be a main subject of jokes and conversation here for a long time. In one of London's street barrow markets, Chapel Market in Islington, a seller of tropical fruits and vegetables, Dennis Rothwell, worked a deliberate confusion into his sales pitch. “Four and six,” he said,“— 46 new pence.” Four shillings and sixpence is actually equal to 22.5 new pence, as the near by decimal conversion table showed. Harrods, at the upper end of the shopping scale, had young girls in boaters with blue rib bons to help out — decimal pennies, they were called. Mostly they advised customers to pay in larger amounts and then try to understand the change.

1245-> Treigle ‘Preaches’ Again in City Opera's ‘Susannah’
The New York City Opera hit the sawdust trail again Sunday night, with a revival of Carlisle Floyd's “Susan nah,” and there on the pulpit was Norman Treigle in the role of the Rev. Olin Mitch, as expert as ever at thumping a Bible or seducing a hill billy girl with a quick aria. Mr. Treigle portrayed the circuit‐riding preacher in the first New York City Opera performance 15 years ago, and many times subsequently. Both leading characters, in fact, were deeply Into their parts for this new produc tion. Maralin Niska, the Susannah, gave scores of per formances in the role during the one season that the Metropolitan Opera National Company existed, in 1965‐66. The good‐looking soprano at tracted a lot of deserved at tention then, vocally and oth erwise: The Jose Quintero staging called on her to go bathing in a stream while ap parently naked (back to the audience, of course). • Miss Niska, although frus trated somewhat by the new production's needlessly melo dramatic staging, managed to be properly rhapsodic in her big aria, “Ain't It a Pretty Night?”, while forced to wrestle about coyly with the village idiot, Little Bat (David Hall). The point of the music here is to suspend earthly motion while she wonders at the universe, and the staging should have let that mood develop. Mr. Treigle's dramatic grip on the preacher's character could not be surer, and out of what must be the least con vincing seduction aria in all opera, “I'm a lonely man, Susannah,” he made a touch ing moment. It was a tour de force of acting with the voice. Blitch's revival‐meeting scene, a Treigle trademark since the 1956 production, carried most of its old power and would have carried more had Julius Rudel's conducting not been so enthusiastic that it drowned out the voices. Much of the night, the or chestra sounded as if it were going at “Die Walküre” rather than Mr. Floyd's musi cally flimsy opera. Perhaps, for that reason, one under stood less of the English dialogue than in the past. Surprisingly, the new pro duction, directed by Robert Lewis, defies 1971 stage con vention by having Susannah go offstage to undress and bathe. That should have been to let imagination run free, rather than to tie it to the sight of an opera singer splashing about on a dry, stage. But Mr. Lewis, who is a veteran of the Group Thea ter and a co‐founder of Ac tors' Studio, fumbled here, as elsewhere. The town El ders (this opera is a transfer ence to Dogpatch of the Apocryphal tale of Susannah and the Elders) gather on stage in front of the conduc tor, and all too obviously worry more about singing than about peeping at an un suspecting woman. • Much of the time, in fact, this production could have taken cues from the National Company's dramatically con vincing show, which was a marvel of tight ensemble. Ming Cho Lee's sets, with their small, raked platforms and conventionally fragmen tary structures, will serve, but they are no match in in genuity or effectiveness for his own National Company sets, which suggested needle point samplers. One wondered why, with those sets lying in some warehouse, new designs by Ming Cho Lee were con siodered necessary. The cast also included Harry Theyard, Barbara Shut tleworth, Sandra Darling, Mary Cross Lueders, Deborah Kieffer, Jack Bittner, Don Yule, Bernard Fitch, John Lankston, Talmage Harper, Joseph Galiano and Robert Manno. In this first perform ance, none of them managed to create a sharply individual character, perhaps because the direction wanted to lump them together as the Evil People in this musical‐car toon treatment of Life old parable.

1247-> Court Dismisses Vesco's S.E.C. Suit
NEWARK, May 24—United States District Court Judge Reynier J. Wortendyke cleared the way here today for the Se curities and Exchange Commis sion to delve further into the intricate financial dealings of the International Control Cor poration, Robert L. Vesco, its 35‐year‐old chairman, and In vestors Overseas Services, the giant mutual‐fund complex. Mr. Vesco is also chairman of I.O.S. Although Judge Wortendyke will take up tomorrow whether Mr. Vesco and International Controls should be required to disclose more about their deal ings with 1.0.S., he dismissed a suit today that sought to prevent the S.E.C. from so doing. The court decision followed a weekend announcement by the International Controls Cor poration that a new subsidiary, American Interland, Ltd., had agreed to issue an unspecified amount of its stock for the stock of a “non‐United States company” whose only assets are the six million preferred shares originally owned by Bernard Cornfeld, founder of I.O.S. Mr. Vesco and the Interna tional Controls Corporation had sued the Securities and Ex change Commission to prevent the commission's attempt to block the sale of four offerings to the public until International Controls provided the Govern ment with more information about its dealings with I.O.S. The S.E.C. particularly is seeking to determine what Interna tional Controls and Mr. Vesco know about the original pur chaser of Mr. Cornfeld's six million shares. Judge Wortendyke, acting on Mr. Vesco's contention that to disclose such information would violate Swiss law, ruled that such a claim could not be en forced in United States courts. In a particularly outspoken statement, Judge Wortendyke, who is close to the retirement age of 70 remarked: “I don't care, to put it bluntly whether the policy of the Swiss nation is to keep secret certain busi ness transactions. That is clear ly not the business of the United States of America and the domestic policy must pre vail.” Mr. Vesco sat during the day long trial with his chin cupped in his hands, while one of his six attorneys, Sherwin J. Mark man, stood by the company's contention that it could not dis close details of its dealings with I.O.S. without violating Swiss secrecy laws. However, he disclosed that International Controls was at tempting to get waivers from its secrecy pledge from Mr. Cornfeld, from Investors Over seas Services itself and from the Overseas Development Bank, where as a director Mr. Vesco first learned about the purchaser of Mr. Cornfeld's six million shares. Mr. Markman said that Mr. Cornfeld had not yet responded to the request for the waiver and that both LOS. and the bank said they would consider it, pending further information, Mr. Markman added, however, that the Swiss Government would not waive its right to prosecute Mr. Vesco if lie vio lated Swiss law. He charged the S.E.C. with “pushing the authority of bureaucratic regulation beyond what the law intends” and said it was improper to subject Mr. Vesco to criminal prosecution in Switzerland. Speaking through a micro phone in a loud, clear voice, Mr. Markman contended that the International Controls Cor poration and Mr. Vesco had given the Government “full, complete and accurate registra tion statements” with as much information about its dealings with I.O.S. as it could legally provide under Swiss 1aw. “What they (the S.E.C.) are really after,” he said, “is I.O.S. They're interested in I.O.S. They want I.O.S. documents. Why don't they go after 1.0.S.? Why not go after Bernie Corn feld? We're not Bernie Corn feld.” Robert E. Kushner, assistant, attorney general for the S.E.C., who appeared along with'John W. Bissell, assistant United States attorney and four other S.E.C. lawyers, criticized what he termed the “breathtaking speed” with which Interna tional Controls had become in volved in the affairs of I.O.S. and the “atmosphere of secrecy” around its dealings. He noted that less than nine months had elapsed since Inter national Controls had first reached an agreement to res cue I.O.S. and that the events since then had, been “momen tous and rapid.” He said that International Controls was working toward obtaining at least a 25 per cent interest in I.O.S. and that the question arose as to whether in come reported by International Controls as coming from I.O.S. was accurate. He said the S.E.C. wanted to know the fi nancial condition of I.O.S., its assets, and its liabilities, or whether the investors in Inter national Controls would con tinue to be faced with what he termed the “successful wall of secrecy” that the company and Mr. Vesco had erected. Judge Wortendyke recessed the court until 10 A.M. tomor row to consider an S.E.C. re quest for a court order that Mr. Vesco and International Con trols provide the information sought.

1249-> Grain Elevators Bulge With Record Corn Crop, as Prices Fall
JEFFERSON, Iowa, Oct. 26— The grain elevators and storage bins in the Middle West were bulging this week with part of the largest corn crop on record, and many farmers were facing lower market prices and the prospect of little improvement for 1972, regardless of anything the Nixon Administration may accomplish with the economy. The primary cause of all this was the farmers themselves. But with all indicators pointing to two more years of declining farm income, the President may find the level of, discontent among many Middle Western farmers at a dangerous point next fall. Last year's corn crop was drastically reduced by blight and drought. This year, fearful that a recurrence of the blight would eliminate reserve sup plies of corn, the Department of Agriculture allowed farmers to plant 20 per cent more land in corn without losing their eli gibility for price supports. Virtually all corn growers in the Middle West rushed to take advantage of this, many of them in the belief that the blight would strike elsewhere and they would reap the benefit of higher prices, which reached $1.40 a bushel last fall for those Who had crops to sell. But the blight did not reap pear in most major corn grow ing areas. As a result, this year's total crop was expected to exceed 5.4 billion bushels, 30 per cent more than last year's and at least 600‐million bushels more than the country normally uses or exports. So farmers here in Greene County were being offered less than $1 a bushel this week. Even if they chose to take sup port prices for their corn, they would get only $1.05, and their greatly increased yields were not large enough to offset these low prices. At the same time, the prices they were offered for hogs were still being held down by the current numbers of animals available for market, hovering around $19 a hundredweight compared with a high of $26 earlier in 1970. “I barely got $19 this week when I sent a big load to market,” Richard Betts, who handles More than 2,000 hogs on 800 acres southwest of jef ferson, told a visitor. At these prices, Mr. Betts will not lose money, on an oper ation as large and efficient as his. But he predicted that he would net 20 per cent less than last year, and he could not foresee any improvement by this time next year. And most Greene County farmers were convinced that even if hog prices stayed low for the next few months, retail food prices would remain as high as they were now, with the processors taking as much as the price board would allow. Last week, Secretary of Agri culture Clifford M. Hardin an nounced that he was doubling the percentage of corn land that farmers must set aside next year to be eligible for price supports. If enough farm ers agree to this program, next year's corn crop could be re duced and the price improved somewhat. But few farmers in Greene County believe that this cut back will be enough to offset the enormous carryover from this year and agricultural econ omists in Iowa agree, predict ing that corn will again be sell ing at close to $1.05 a bushel next fall if growing conditions are normal. Mr. Betts, a brisk, positive man who was still cheerful in recounting his estimates of the future, dropped a spiraled rec ord book on his dining room table and pointed to the entries. “You can look at those and see why we think we're getting the short end of things,” he said. “We've lost $10 a hun dred on our hogs just since June, and yet pork prices stay the same in the supermarkets. Certainly nobody made farm ers plant all that corn this year. But they did, and you can be sure that a lot more of them will put that cheap corn into hogs, which can only mean pork prices for us won't get any better.” Farmers in Greene County who feed cattle, a much small er percentage than those who raise hogs, were less pessimis tic than Mr. Betts. Royal Holtz, a calm, soft‐ spoken man who fattens 1,000 head of feeder cattle on his farm near Grand Junction, said he looked for another stable year in cattle prices. “We've finally got cattle numbers in line with consump tion, and with corn now so cheap, we should go on doing all right,” he said. “But plan ners had better look to doing something about interest rates next year, or we'll all be look ing at a lower net by next fall.” Mr. Holtz said he and his neighbors were skeptical that Phase Two of the President's economic program would hold down wage rates, which they largely blame for the cost‐ price squeeze that they exper ienced this year. “We just can't go on paying labor the wages they are de manding,” he said. “Farmers around here are generally un happy about things as they are. I don't think they realize the problems that could have de veloped this year if Mr. Hardin hadn't increased the planting allowances. Certainly a lot of the big crop problem was caused by the farmers them selves. But in an election year, they don't blame themselves.” Greene County Republican leaders agreed with this ap praisal. “There's no logical reason to blame the Nixon Administra tion, even in hindsight,” said Rich Morain, chairman of the Greene County Republican Com mittee who is assistant publish er of The Jefferson Bee and Herald. “But the Democrats can once again shout that after three years of a Republican Administration, net farm in come is still going down. If there isn't an evident improve ment by next year, Mr. Nixon could lose the farm vote here and maybe in the rest of the Midwest.”

1250-> Harlem Prep and Academies Periled
The Urban League Street Academy program and the Har lem Preparatory School — two bold experiments widely her alded for retrieving high‐school dropouts and sending them on to college—have lost major cor porate and foundation financing and face uncertain futures. Six of the fourteen original street academies were closed in December. And Harlem Prep does not have enough money to open in the fall. “If saved, it'll be a miracle; if not saved, it'll be a crime,” said Robert J. Mangum, Com missioner of the State Division of Human Rights and newly elected chairman of Harlem Prep's board of directors. In interviews over the last three weeks with corporation executives, administrators and others associated with the pro grams, a number of reasons for the troubles were stated, in cluding the recession, a lack of long‐term commitment on the part of the corporations and charges of fiscal malfeasance. The three‐phase program de signed to bring alienated youngsteti into an educational process radically different from the one that had not worked for them was started in 1966 by Dr. Eugene S. Callender at Har lem's Church of the Master, where he was pastor. As the program developed, corporations were to assume support of the first and second phases — street academies and academies, of transition — at $50,000 per corporation per academy. The street academies were lo cated in storefronts, primarily in Harlem, but also in the Bronx, the Lower East Side and Brooklyn. They were to serve as induction centers—informal settings in which young men and women were given basic remedial instruction while be ing freed from the traditional timetables of established insti tutions. A major ingredient was the street worker—persons similar to guidance counselors who used the psychology and lan guage of the streets, along with mother wit and whatever else it took to meet the needs of the students. Academies of transition, the next step, prepared the students “for entry into formal learning situations.” The prep schools followed, with college as the ultimate goal. Dr. Callender said recently that the aim, was to “set up a competitive school system to expose the deficiencies in the school system by equipping drop‐outs for college.” Initially students were sent to Newark Preparatory School. In 1968 Dr. Callender, who had moved to the Urban League, founded Harlem Prep under the league's auspices. Newark Prep closed last year because of financial problems. Educational assistance came from many sources, including three nuns from Manhattanville College. Harold Oostydk, a young, white college drop‐out from New Jersey who had worked on the lower East Side with a basically suburban, most ly white religious group called Young Life and who had been working with Dr. Callender at the church, became education director of the league, with major responsibility for street workers and the academies. He later was to become a key figure in much of the internal friction in the program. In less than three years Harlem Prep, which now oper ates out of a handsome reno vated supermarket at Eighth Avenue near 136th Street, has graduated 214 students and placed them in colleges and universities throughput the country, including Harvard, Vassar and Bryn Mawr. Only 10 of the 214 have dropped out. Thirty‐two have reached their junior year. “People from all over the world come here to learn from what we're doing,” said Edward F. Carpenter, the school's be leaguered headmaster. The street academy concept has also been copied. The Post Office Department is currently providing $4‐million for acad emies in six major cities. And several are being operated in other cities by the National Urban League. Why, then, as one former administrator of the program put it, “are they about to abandon the precursor?” Why are these two institutions en gaged in such a desperate struggle to survive? Some of the reasons given In interviews recently included the following: ¶A lack of understanding of the nature of the programs and an absence of long‐term com mitment from the corporations. ¶Poor administration that often resulted in mismanage ment and charges of fiscal mal feasance. ¶Internal friction, including a major exodus of influential board members and teachers from Harlem Prep during the last several months. The six corporations that withdrew from the academy program said they not only had lived up to their original com mitment of sponsoring an academy for one year, but had, in fact, stayed on for a second year. The corporate sponsors were the Celanese Corporation, Pan American World Airways, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Chase Manhattan Bank, Mor gan Guaranty Trust and Amer ican Express. “We've done our share,” said Sidney Trundle, senior vice president of Manufacturers Hanover Trust. “We've put $100,000 into the picture.” Dr. Callender, who is now executive director of the New York Urban Coalition, is highly critical of that position. “I don't think you can put a timetable on a commitment to social change,” he said in his coalition office at 55 Fifth Avenue. “This shows that that was conscience money. The riots were going on. And now, the burning has stopped.” An Urban League official called the $100,000 “a drop in the bucket.” Steve. Miller, who was one of the liaison men for Celanese, agreed that the “climate of the times” affected the corpora tions, but, he interpreted their actions a bit differently. “The role of the corporation as a citizen was just coming into its own,” he explained. “How do you express it? Oostydk had a channel. The corporations were delighted to have a channel In which to act as a responsible citizen. And they honestly thought their in vestment would work.” Pan American cited the re cession as its major reason for withdrawal. “Unfortunately,” said its representative, William Birely, “we got into major money problems—a big loss in 1969, and in 1970 it was even bigger. We laid off thousands of people, and unfortunately when the red ink shows, any thing that is not of a direct business nature is the first to go. In an industrial sense, when the money gets limited, you tend to get more and more conservative.” Chase Manhattan, with a to tal urban affairs budget of $2.5 million, is no longer supporting a street academy, but is using the money for minority train ing, minority loans and “other projects in the minority area.” Most of the others also indi cated they were continuing with some efforts to aid minor ities. American Express switched its support to another Urban League program, and increased the amount. First‐year disappointments, spokesmen for the corporations said, included several cases in which money, was spent — on construction, renovation, pay ments to faculty — but there were “no students in the school,” or the “student body was very fluid.” Nor were the corporations satisfied with the number of graduates in the second year. “We kind of dreamed that for the dollars spent, the num bers would have been higher,” said Mr. Birely of Pan American. “The estimates given us were 30 to 40 per term and ours never came to anything like that.” Costs exceeded expectations. This was due in part, the spokesmen said, to several problems, including the follow ing: ¶Delays in getting store fronts renovated and furnishea: “We tried to use minority con tractors who didn't have the money to succeed,” said one executive. “They'd often start a job and never come back.” ¶Materials — both building and educational—would be or dered and never arrive; or would arrive and disappear. ¶Unrealistic architectural plans did not conform to build ing‐code regulations. ¶Written reports were, for the most part, unavailable. “It Was difficult to justify to stockholders that expendi ture,” said Mr. Miller of Ce lanese. “We were also of the opinion that the major thrust was in stitutional change,” he added. “Instead we found the thrust in remedial education. By the time we left, we felt we could no longer be really effective expending the money in the name of institutional change.” Most of the six corporations shared the belief that the thrust of the program was to be institutional change, al though there were some, like Chase Manhattan, whose repre sentative, John Davis, said they were “not exactly sure how the program was to relate to the school system.” “We saw it as a vehicle to bring about institutional change in the city, and in time, as it became more successful it would put itself out of busi ness,” said Robert Langley of Morgan Guaranty. Some companies, like Manu facturers Hanover, saw them selves “strictly as funding sources.” Mr. Miller said that Celanese made that mistake initially, but that “we came to realize that we had a partnership here— we had to be there, not to di rect, but to respond. “Unfortunately there were some of us—one guy in par ticular, right off Fifth Avenue and showed it—who were sym bols of all the students' frus trations.” Another corporate sponsor who said his company had be come actively involved in its academy cited other problems. “Before Oostydk left, he had his own team of people. When he left, there were replacements at all levels, like a palace re volt. Life became very uncer tain—especially for the white people,” because of the “switch to control by the community rather than outside sources. “A couple of white guys seemed to find themselves with out a real goal or purpose. Sud denly people were telling them that they were irrelevant. And they were.” The most severe‐ criticism, and perhaps the one shared by everyone involved, was over the problem of administration. “When Hary [the name by which Mr. Oostydk was widely known] left Central Harlem, he created a tremendous vacuum,” said Dr. Callen der, who had departed a year before to go to the, Urban Coali tion. “He ran the whole opera tion close to the chest.” Everyone agrees. But Mr., Wingate, who inherited from Dr. Callender an Urban League that was operating in the red, said the vacuum existed be cause Mr. Oostydk never wrote, anything down, and refused to encourage any black admini strative development. Mr. Oostydk, a huge, hulking man in his 30's with deeply, inset eyes and a deliberately measured speaking manner, dis agrees. “How can you run a success ful program,” he asked — his face lit with a hint of a smile —“with someone always peek ing in your oven—turning the patty‐cakes over or wanting to sprinkle a little salt or pepper here and there?” But Mr. Wingate insisted there was more to it than that. He also charged Mr. Oostydk with having left him “with over $750,000 worth of debt, thou sands of dollars of bounced checks and an administrative fiscal monstrosity.” “He had also promised that every kid would go to college free, Mr. Wingate asserted. “He did pay for some, but there were some who didn't go and wanted to kill him.” Mr. Wingate said that Mr. Oostydk paid $220,000 for 100 students to go to Newark Prep for a year out of funds from Young Life, which is said to have substantial financial sup port from businessmen but has no connection with the Urban League. Mr. Wingate said hia board members had assumed that Mr. Oostydk was operating witthin the league's budget and were unprepared for a $220,000 debt the following year. Others from within the pro gram feel that Mr. Oostydk's private ventures now are drain ing corporate support from the Urban League street academies. After a brief stint with the coalition, he founded the Hol low Corporation, a nonprofit organization located at 215 West 92nd Street. Mr. Oostydk played a role in getting the Post Office Depart ment involved in its street academy program. And he has continued from Hollow to de velop an organization called Streetwbrkers, Inc. One bank vice president recalled getting a letter from him recently that ended with the postscript: “And remember, this is the year of the streetworker!” Mr. Oostydk denies any im propriety in his actions. While admitting that he “made mis takes,”.he says he does not see the need nor does he care to defend himself against charges. “If there's any legal impropri ety, they're open to pursue it,” he said. “We always struggle to send every kid to college and there is validity to the statement that I used whatever money I could get. I got corporate money be cause I work hard. But how can one man be the key? It's a myth.” Mr. Oostydk blamed the ad ministrative problems on “a lack of decisiveness,” within the Urban League. The whole mess could be cleaned up in a year if certain power structures move,” he said. “They need leadership.” In May, 1970, Mr. Wingate appointed Kwami Taha, a for mer tutor in the academy, to the post of central administra tor. Since that time, Mr. Taha said, he has been trying to “pull the academies together,” and develop new funding sources in order to save the program. But, he contends, “anyone coming in without a personal tie to the funding sources is at a diadvantage.” At present, 1,278 students are enrolled in the program at a cost of about $548.90 a stri dent. Total expenditures this year, so far, are in the neigh borhood of $698,939.80. The closing of six academies meant that, with a total staff of 37, 800 to 900 students had to be assimilated into the other eight academies. “It was tough,” Mr. Taha recalled. “We just couldn't absorb them all,” Mr. Taha is also faced with the problem of having students ready to enter prep schools, but no prep schools available to take them in tuition‐free. Harlem Prep, meanwhile, has similar problems. According to Edward J. Carpenter, its head master, the school has never enjoyed long‐term financial commitment, but rather has narrowly survived from year to year, with its major source of support being the Shiela Mosier Foundation. Through the in volvement of Mrs. Mosier, whose husband John, owns the Mosier Safe Company, Harlem Prep has received more than $2‐million in the last two years from her foundation. Mrs. Mosier could not be reached for comment, but Mr. Carpenter said that she could no longer continue meeting the bills for the school. Other large contributors have included the Ford and Carnegie Foundations, Standard Oil of New Jersey and the Metropoli tan Life Insurance Company. But the school has never en joyed endowments, nor the services of professional fund raisers, nor, with the exception of Standard Oil, the support of any company willing to make long‐term commitment. “I cannot say that the black community has not been help ing at their limits, either,” Mr. Carpenter said. But those con tributions accounted for about 5 per cent of the total budget. The school's major crisis came within the last several months when, led by Dr. Cal lender, most of the original board resigned after demand ing Mr. Carpenter's resignation. He was accused of unneces sarily exceeding approved bud get allocations by thousands of dollars. During this time, also, most of the original faculty mem bers resigned, including the nuns. And all grants to the school, including a $56,000 por tion of a three stage, $250,000 Ford grant, were suspended pending an investigation. “Our investigating commit tee took sworn testimony and with the accountants' check found no evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of Ed Carpenter,” said Commissioner Mangum, who became chair man of the board when the group of board members led by Dr. Callender resigned. “I wanted a grand‐jury in vestigation,” Mr. Carpentei re called recently, “but I backed off when I realized that was ego rather than we‐go. The students know and the parents know. And we have to move together.” The remaining board mem bers, like Commissioner Man gum, expressed confidence in Mr. Carpenter, but they said he “has too many responsibili ties.” “For three years, Ed has been doing everything—administrat ing, raising funds, teaching— and with no help,” Commis sioner Mangum said. “You can't expect one man to do all of those things.” Meanwhile, the investigation satisfied the money sources and the balance of the Ford grants are due on March 1 and June 1. But Commissioner Man gum said, “except for that, there's no other money in sight.” The school needs $100,000 above the Ford money just to graduate its senior class of 170. Without $200,000 the school will not open in the fall. The Urban Coalition is cur rently sponsoring two acad emies that are connected with city high schools. The cost for one last year came to $100,000, with the Board of Education furnishing teachers and some supplies. The plan is that the Board of Education will even tually assume the entire cost. Harlem Prep's budget last year came to more than $600, 1000—some of which was at tributable to new construction, according to Commissioner Mangum. Mr. Carpenter said he has reduced the budget to be tween $350,000 and $400,000. Robert Kingsley, representing Standard Oil of New Jersey, which has contributed more than $210,000 to the school over the last three years, said that contrary to the “usual one‐ to two‐year extent of corpor ate giving,” Standard Was “in for the long pull.” “What they are doing here,” Mr. Kingsley said, “is unique— definitely motivating young Isters toward achievement and serving the community. It's an elite education in the sense that only a few kids are being helped. But its value is that it's proven successful and is being replicated elsewhere. “We don't see anything around more hopeful than Harlem Prep. And while this may be naive, I don't think we can afford to let this school fail.”

1252-> POLICE IN JERSEY STUDY FIRE BOMBS
HOBOKEN, N. J.; Nov. 1 — The police were searching to night for clues and motives in a rash of incendiary actions against the five chain‐operated supermarkets here. The first evidence of what appeared to be a concerted effort to damage or destroy the large retail outlets here of the A.&P., Shoprite, Pantry Pride, Finast and Foodtown came to light at 3:51 A.M. yesterday when a fire broke out in the cereals section in one of the A.&P.'s three outlets in the city. Firemen who responded were fighting the blaze, which caused heavy damage to part of the market, when a second fire broke out in the same store. The second outbreak was quickly doused by the firemen. They found several cartons that originally had contained a gela tin pudding preparation. The boxes, the size of a small cereal box with a capacity of about 24 dry ounces, were found to contain three table tennis balls into which gasoline had been injected with hypodermic need les. A fourth ball was found to contain corrosive acid. It had been split in half and taped together again. Neither fire caused any in juries. Capt. Walter X. Drew, com mander of the detective force of the Hoboken Police Depart ment, said that the acid even tually ate its way through the tape, caused the nearby paper to smolder and ignited the gasoline‐filled table‐tennis balls. He said he was not prepared to ascribe a motive for the activity nor to suspect any known dissident individual or group of activists. Eleven cartons containing the devices have been found in all three A.&P. stores here and in each of the city's branches of the other four chain stores. None have been reported in small grocery stores or by any other merchandising stores in town. In each case the table‐tennis balls were found inserted and slightly dented in cardboard containers marked “Tembleque” packed by Goya Products. ‘Tembleque” is a kind of coco nut‐pudding dessert.

1253-> Penn Central Loss In September Cut From a Year Ago
The Penn Central Trans portation Company's trus tees reported yesterday that the railroad's net loss for September was $16,376,446 and amounted to $195,537, 607 in the first nine months this year. The railroad filed for re organization on June 21, 1970, and in September of last year the net loss was $24,760,598. For the first nine months of 1970, the net loss was $233,691,065. The accounts for both periods were made on a fully accrued basis, assuming full obliga tion for fixed interest, taxes and other fixed charges, most of which have not been paid since the bankruptcy filing. These charges all must be satisfied in the final reor ganization plan. The Penn Central's trus tees still have not written off the railroad's investment in certain railroad passenger facilities turned over on May 1 to Amtrak, the Govern ment‐owned passenger‐serv ice corporation. The amount of the writedown of the in vestment in these facilities, as well as other related costs and losses, is being determined, the railroad said yesterday. The final figure will be reported as an extraordinary charge against results at the close of the year. As partial reimbursement to the trustees, Amtrak paid the railroad $1.5‐million in Septem ber for its operation of pas senger service under contract. Payments for the year to date amounted to $16.2‐million. Penn Central's freight rev enues in September were $129‐ million, up from $116‐million in September of last year, re flecting higher freight rates. For the first nine months of the year freight revenues were $1.2‐billion, compared with $1.1‐billion in the similar 1970 period.

1256-> Alleged Link to City Housing Loan Denied by Beame
Two officers of a bank for which Abraham D. Beame, was finance chairman owned 60 per cent of a corporation that ob tained a $2‐million loan from the Municipal Loan Program for the rehabilitation of nine buildings in Williamsburg, it was disclosed yesterday at a hearing of a City Council com mittee. Mr. Beame is now City Controller, but did not hold that office at the time of the loan. A spokesman ?? Mr. Beame said last night that at the time referred to, Mr. Beame “had nothing to do with the day‐to day workings of the bank,” and pointed out that recently Mr. Beame had issued three reports on the Municipal Loan Pro gram, “which have included revelations” concerning activi ties of the man who organized the corporation. The loan was applied for in October, 1969, shortly before Mr. Beame was elected Con troller, an office he had previ ously held. The information came to light as Councilman Robert I. Postel, Manhattan Democrat, was ques tioning Robert G. Hazen, former Commissioner of Development of the Housing and Develop ment Administration. The com mittee had summoned Mr. Hazen in their investigation of charges of, inflated mortgages, kickbacks and other abuses of the Municipal Loan Program for rehabilitation of slum housing. Mr. Postel asked Mr. Hazen, who formerly supervised the loan program, whether he was aware of the identity of the owners of the corporation. He also asked him whether polit ical pressure had been brought to obtain approval of the loan. Mr. Hazen asserted that “no pressure of a political nature” had ever been brought to bear on him to grant city loans. The nine buildings rehabili tated in the Williamsburg sec tion of Brooklyn by the corpo ration in question, formed by Herman Kraus, were defended by Mr. Hazen as “some of the best jobs in the program.” Mr. Hazen said he had not known who the partners in the corporation were, but had heard the name of Philip Klutz nick, whom he identified as “a former representative to the United Nations Human Rights Commission and active in hous ing finance for many years,” mentioned in connection with the project at the time. In reply to other questions by Mr. Postel, Mr. Hazen said he was not aware that Mr. Klutznick was chairman of the American Bank and Trust Com pany, nor aware that Mr. Klutz nick and the bank's vice chairmen, Abraham Feinberg owned 60 per cent of the cor poration. “Were you aware that Abraham D. Beame was then finance chairman of the bank,” asked Mr. Postel. “I have no knowledge of that one way or another,” Mr. Hazen replied. He added that in his judgment there was not the slightest possibility that Mr. Beame had used influence to get the loan. He said there was “nothing untoward what soever” about the loan, which had been “a sound step forward in the Municipal Loan Program. Mr. Postel asked Mr. Hazen whether he was aware that Mr. Klutznick and Mr. Feinberg had obtained an unsecured loan of $200,000 from the American Bank and Trust Company, which was used to buy seven of the nine buildings to be rehabilitated by the Kraus cor poration. Mr. Hazen said he did not know this and had not heard, as alleged by Mr. Postel, that Mr. Kraus had only a 5 per cent interest in the corporation. The questions concerning the Kraus corporation came after Mr. Postel introduced in evi dence a copy of a memorandum dated Oct. 28, 1969, from Wil liam D. Clarke to Mr. Hazen. Mr. Clarke, then in charge of the loan program under Mr. Hazen, raised several objec tions in the memo to Mr. Kraus's proposal that various new procedures be used in con nection with the loan he was applying for. Mr. Hazen said Mr. Kraus had come to H.D.A. with an innovative, interesting proposal designed to take advantage of the recent passage of an amend ment to the Federal tax law. Mr. Postel introduced a copy of another memo, from Mr. Kraus to Mr. Clarke, dated Nov. 10, 1971, replying to the objections raised. On the same date, according to another memorandum intro duced, Mr. Clarke wrote to Steven Ziegler, an associate of Mr. Kraus's, to go ahead with construction. “This indicates a dramatic change in position” by Mr. Clarke, Mr. Postel said. “Did you direct Mr. Clarke to write to Ziegler telling him of per mission to tell his client to begin construction?” Mr. Hazen replied that “I don't agree that represents a dramatic change; he was carry ing out our policy. The build ings were capable of rehabili tation and work could start, but under regular procedures, with continued discussion of the special situation “ Mr. Hazen was succeeded on the witness stand by Mr. Clarke, who said he had not given the copies of the memo randums to Mr. Postel, but ver ified that they were authentic, and identified his signature. Mr. Clarke, former H.D.A. deputy commissioner in charge of the loan program, will re turn as a witness when the next hearing is held Nov. 5 by the Council Committee on Char ter and Governmental Opera tions. The Municipal Loan Program was established nine years ago to provide long‐term, low interest loans for the rehabili talion of slum housing. It was authorized to lend $138‐million, most of which had been committed when the program was halted by order of the Mayor last July after City Investigation Commis sioner Robert K. Ruskin re ported evidence of possible fraud. Earlier in yesterday's hearing It was disclosed that the wife of Assemblyman George W. Miller, Democrat of Harlem, had received a loan of $280,000 to rehabilitate a five‐story, 29‐ unit building at 522 West 158th Street. When the loan was granted on Oct. 7, 1970, one month before the Assembly man's election, he was Dem ocratic leader of Harlem's 72d Assembly district.

1257-> GERDA ZIMMERMANN IN DANCE VIGNETTES
The tide of impressionist dancers that was once so full has been reduced to a small stream of practitioners who offer their vignettes sporadically. Among the more adept is Gerda Zimmermann, who presented her “Kammertanz Theater IV” at the Cubiculo Tuesday evening. Her two new works, “Silhouette in Orange” and “Variation on a Theme,” were examples of the categories of dance she creates: the realistic character portrayal and the abstract movement study. “Theme,” which is the more abstract work, was the more successful by virtue of its variety and playful invention. “Silhouette” sketched a lady In Spanish dress breaking out of her restrictive upbringing and kicking up her heels, but was more cartoon than characterization. In general, Miss Zimmermann seems more at ease with abstract designs such as “Contrasts” and “Episode II,” in which she can create and manipulate angular configurations of the body. In this vein she has been able to seek out the striking and unusual, whereas naturalistic themes seem to inhibit her creativity.

1258-> The Stage
Say this for the Four Winds Theater, an off Off Broadway acting unit that roams the city and hits the road to vivify history: Their shows keept fact before fiction. The small unit also can spin an enterprise professionally in dime‐sized space. Last summer, linked with the South Street Seaport Museum, Four Winds used a pier tent to recreate the days of American Merchant sailing. Yesterday, again partly funded by the State Council on the Arts, the unit depicted the Spanish conquest of Montezuma's Mexico. It was, the right show in the right hall — the Hall of Mexico in the sponsoring American Museum of Natural History. The 70‐minute “Day of the Serpent” will continue through Sunday at 2 P.M., with an extra Saturday runoff at 11 A.M. Admission is free. The small ensemble, clad in exotic costumes, performed before and around a hall reproduction of a huge Mayan monument, strategically lighted. Again, Jenny Egan, the Four Winds director, has wisely culled her facts and most of the dialogue straight from past records. George Loros was a properly wily Cortes, Frank Groseclose was an effective narrator and Alan Sklar made a good, dignified Montezuma, even with a long, redundant closing speech. Ron Cunningham effectively danced to the choreography of Daniel Hagen that told the whole story and John Selleck's electronic musical score was excellent. The museum's Hall of Mexico, however apropos, was also as hot as Mexico in July.

1259-> Et Al.
A short account of the author's experience with open heart surgery in a New York hospital last year — originally published in The New Yorker. Absolutely a minimum of hard information—a pure New Yorker approach — shot through with little emotional gasps and details. The operation itself is frightening because much goes wrong—nobody seems to know why. Miss MacKenzie's stay in Intensive Care is a nightmare — she develops mysterious complications. Gradually she gets better — enough to go home but not to be completely free of symptoms. For all its mannerisms, the memoir is affecting.

1260-> Lodge, Nixon's Voice at Vatican, Gets Enviable Papal Audiences
ROME, March 24 — Whenever President Nixon's special envoy to the Vatican, Henry Cabot Lodge, is about to see Pope Paul VI he dons a dark blue suit and blue necktie and does some last‐minute reading on Indochina in the confidential files from Saigon, Washington and Paris. Vietnam is a recurring topic in the audiences that Ambassador Lodge has with the Pontiff about once every three months. Such an audience is expected this week. The head of the Roman Catholic Church and the Presidéntial envoy review other world issues in their meetings in the Pope's private library in the Apostolic Palace—aid to underdeveloped countries, refugees, the international drug traffic, East‐West contacts, Communist China. When he is here between audiences, Mr. Lodge does in Rome what any ambassador usually does—speaks with other briefed peruses dispatches and is entertained, briefs and is briefed, peruses dispatches—although he is not actually a member of the diplomatic corps. As a personal representative of President Nixon, he has no ambassadorial rank or diplomatic status. He did ask for diplomatic license plates after his car got stuck in traffic on the way to the Vatican, so that he barely showed up in time. The Pontiff and the envoy confer privately in French, in which both are fluent. It is the Pope who signals when the meeting is over. An experienced diplomat here said enviously: “To have the Pope's attention without witnesses for half an hour is a little summit.” The Vatican, adhering, to its age‐old practice of secret diplomacy, brushes off questions. Mr. Lodge, who has been Ambassador to South Vietnam and West Germany and chief United States delegate at the Unit ed Nations and at the Vietnam peace conference in Paris, allows himself only polite generalities. Informed churchmen say that Pope Paul, in every meeting with Mr. Lodge and with other. United States officials, pressed, Washington to explore all avenues for an early negotiated peace in Vietnam. Mr. Lodge is known to have assured the Pope that President Nixon means what he says about military disengagement. pris‐, oners of war in North Vietnam is another subject that is usually mentioned by Mr. Lodge. The Vatican maintains a tenuous link with Hanoi, and Washington thinks that church mediation may one day help to bring them home. In a recent interview here. Mr. Lodge, discounting the view that his mission here was, mainly aimed at soaking up intelligence from the church's many channels, said: “I don't think of the Vatican primarily as a source of information but as a force in the world that can help the United States.” He cited the recent Vatican endorsement of the 1968 treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons as an example. An Episcopalian, Mr. Lodge sees many Cardinals, superiors of religious orders and other high churchmen. Mrs. Lodge has a brace of princes of the church as guests at times. The Lodges stay at the Grand Hotel, where Suite 330 serves as the two‐room office of the American envoy, who gets no salary (the United States refunds his expenses). A United States Foreign Service officer, Robert F. IIIing, and a secretary, Katherine Astala, make up Mr. Lodge's staff. Mr. Illing, who served in Belgrade before the Vatican assignment, maintains liaison during the periods when Mr. Lodge is absent. Both Mr. Illing and Miss Astala, who worked for two years at the United States Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, speak Italian. Trim and erect at 68, Mr. Lodge appears to like his parttime post, which allows him to spend much time at home in Beverly, Mass. He also likes the job description, “special envoy.” Many people think it is more than being an ambassador.

1261-> Gallic Aura Sought By French Hospital For New Quarters
The French and Polyclinic Medical School and Health Center is going to try to put the French back in French Hospital. When the institution moves to its new quarters—it hopes to do so by 1974—it will create on two floors an ambiance for French‐speaking patients—including French decor, French nurses and French doctors. This was announced yesterday at a meeting called at the hospital, at 324 West 30th Street, to gain support from the various French and FrenchAmerican societies in New York City. There are about 40 such societies, and 100 members of them attended the meeting. The institution previously announced that it was purchasing the 40‐story, 2,000‐room New Yorker Hotel for conversion into a medical center, with a 749‐bed hospital. The present hospital building will then be used for ambulatory patients. The French Hospital was established in 1881, and over the years was supported by the French Benevolent Society, which went out of existence when the hospital was merged with Polyclinic in 1969. At yesterday's meeting, Eugene Blanc, a trustee, said he hoped the various French, societies in the city would give their spiritual, moral and financial support to the expanding institution. He said the two “French” floors would, hopefully, “continue the softness and elegance found so important by so many of our patients.” Henri Claudel, French Consul General in New York, said that naturally over the years the French Hospital had become “very much an American hospital. “Being a Frenchman,” he said, “it is warming to my heart that some French people in New York will find a homd where they can get good care.”

1262-> 4 YOUTHS INDICTED FOR SLAYING IN BRONX
Four teen‐agers, described by the Bronx District Attorney as members of a youth gang known as the Invaders; were indicted yesterday for murder, attempted murder, assault, attempted assault and possession of a dangerous weapon. The four are accused of the slaying last Oct. 29 of Richard Irrizary, 36 years old, of 540 East Jackson Avenue, the Bronx, who was allegedly kicked, punched, stomped and stabbed while attempting to escape from the gang. Bronx District Attorney Burton B. Roberts said that Mr. Irrizzary and his 14‐year‐old son, who had been threatened by the gang's members after an earlier dispute, encountered some Invaders near East 145th Street and Brook Avenue, the Bronx. Those indicted were identified as Ruben Santiago, 16, of 461 Brook Avenue; Jose Monacho Cruz, 17, of 448 East 145th Street; Robert Rosario, 16, of 383 East 145th Street, and William Hernandez, 16, of 963 Prospect Avenue, all of the Bronx.

1264-> Reader's Report
This novel by Jose Cabanis is vintage realism that holds up exceedingly well. The years 1937 through 1950 seem joyless only in retrospect to Gilbert Samalagnou, who has spent them in hot pursuit of sex. Age 18 finds Gilbert, a student in Toulouse (Cabanis's native city), being initiated by Juliette, an older man's mistress. As the years roll by, he becomes involved with Gaby (his best friend's wife), with Ingrid (a phlegmatic governess), with Noelle (whose father cultivates incest). Happiness eludes him—and when he is asked, toward the end of the novel, whom he loves and who loves him, he says “no one.” The Joyless Years By José Cabanis. Translated by June Guicharnaud. 209 pp. Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice‐Hall. $7.95. Every member of Gilbert's circle in this gray milieu is frustrated in one way or another. Juliette's patron is a man “without hope.” Gilbert's father is a disappointed bureaucrat. Noelle's father goes to prison. Gaby becomes a prostitute. Cabanis sees with his hero's jaundiced eye the wretchedness of brovincial middle‐class society. Why is Gilbert incapable of happiness? For one thing, the atmosphere of the German occupation is un ‐euphoric. For another, Gilbert is enough of a modern man to have rejected religion, and enough of an atavist to read the Bible to his mistress. Such paradoxes are the basis of the book's human chemistry.

The $6.8‐billion budget that Mr. Reagan approved in July is about $310‐million out of balance, largely because of lower than anticipated tax collections.

MODENA, Ialy, Jan. 11 (AP) —The Italian Ferrari racing factory announced today it was withdrawing from the Grand Prix of Argentina Formula One auto race scheduled Jan. 24. A spokesman said the reasons for this withdrawal were ex plained to the Italian Sports Commission, which will then inform the international com mission. Sources in Modena said Fer rari's decision was clearly a protest over the death of its driver, Ignazio Giunti, during the 1,000‐kilometer race at Bue nos Aires yesterday. Giunti was killed when his Ferrari crashed against the Matra car of a French driver, Jean‐Pierre Beltoise, which was stopped in the middle of the track.

1268-> U.S. Acts to Block Mississippi Curbs On Poverty Project
JACKSON, Miss. March (UPI)—The Justice Department filed suit in Federal District Court today to block Gov. John Bell Williams and two other state officials from “unreason able interference” with a fed erally aided program of health services to the poor. Besides Mr. Williams, the suit named the state's Attorney General, A. F. Summer, and Mississippi's Secretary of State, Heber Ladner. The suit, filed on behalf of Attorney General. John N. Mitchell, sought a court order to enjoin Mr. Williams and his aides from interfering with program operated by Tr‐County Community Center, Inc. The suit said that the Office of Economic Opportunity had granted $1,017,508 June 2, 1970, to Tr‐County, a nonprofit cor poration, to develop and oper ate a health service for low‐in come persons in Jackson and surrounding Hinds County. The suit said that Governor Williams and his aides filed a legal action Sept. 18, 1970, in the Hinds County Circuit Court, seeking a forfeiture of Tri County's state charter. They. contended that it exceeded the privileges and franchises grant ed by its charter under Missis sippi law. They alleged that the corporation had exceeded its charter, in part, by obtaining and administering the О.Е.О. grant. According to the Federal suit, Tr‐County filed an amendment to its state charter to conform with Mississippi law following the Governor's legal action. But, the Government charged, the state officials failed to ap prove, certify and return the articles of amendment to the organization. At the same time the state officials pursued their legal action. Thus, the complaint charged, they “unreasonably threatened to interfere with or terminate the program of health services being provided by Tri‐County and the United States.”

1270-> AT HOME ABROAD
LONDON, Aug. 6—Philip Toynbee, the English critic, was writing in The Observer of London some years ago about “The Naked Lunch” and an other book by William Burroughs. He was troubled at finding himself on the side of the Philistines. “When I was young,” he said, “pur ple‐faced literary men were breaking furniture in the Savile and Savage Clubs because they were so outraged by the incomprehensible nonsense which Mr. [T. S.] Eliot was flinging In the face of the public. I must have vowed to myself that I would never be like them. “As I type this article my face is pale, compassionate, shrewd and subtle—not at all like theirs. In calm voice, not a tremor to be heard, I pronounce that the two books by Mr. Burroughs are boring rubbish....” The instinctive libertarian finds himself in a position something like Mr. Toynbee's in the great free‐speech case now arousing Britain. That is the case of Oz, an underground paper three of whose editors have just been sen tenced to jail terms on obscenity, charges. Liberal passions are flowing on behalf of Oz. In the magazine New Society, Colin Maclnnes says the ob scenity conviction “runs contrary to centuries of folk wisdom.” He men tions the tradition of obscene folk songs and nursery rhymes. He speaks of Shakespeare, Swift, Burns. To paraphrase Mr. Toynbee, that is unredeemable rubbish. Anyone who can confuse the robust sexuality of, say, Robert Burns' “Merry Muses of Caledonia” with the sickly witless ness of Oz should be in some other line of work than literary criticism. The issue of Oz that was the sub ject of the prosecution emphasized sexual sadism and perversion in crude cartoons and fuzzy photographs. The text advocated youthful drug experi mentation and gave tendentiously in accurate accounts of “revolution” at school. It was labeled a “school kids issue.” My own view is that nastiness should not be censorable, as such, any more than candid sexuality. But the one place where virtually every one who has considered the problem is willing to draw the line is at material for children. That view reflects a societal Judgment, supported by such psychological findings as we have, that children can easily be frightened and their attitudes toward adult life injured in a lasting and serious way by distorted, premature experience. Another argument on behalf of Oz is an essentially political one. The real obscenity of our civilization, it goes, lies not in sex but in rampant materialism and racial discrimination and exploitation of the poor and weak. No mere physical description or feel ings can be as harmful to people as the reality of war and hunger. There is a lot in that: it is a hypo critical society. But it is not going to help the exploited poor and black of the world to exploit the unformed emotions of children. There is nothing wrong with the establishment that necrophiliac cartoons for children can cure. No, the editors or Oz are not John Milton or Thomas Payne or, especial ly, Sigmund Freud. They are over grown children, without any coherent view of society, who are trying to express their anger and make a pound at the same time. There is nothing terribly noble about that, and certain ly nothing to immunize them from society's rightful concern for its chil dren. But alas, there are never easy solu tions in these cases—except for those who think authority is always right or always wrong. And so, in the Oz case, the troubled liberal finds the side of repression even more repellent than the editors' side, disingenuous though it may be. As one looks at the judge and the people who exulted in his sentences, they really are Mr. Toynbee's purple faced men. They would have bowd lerized Shakespeare and Burns. And their blind zeal—their pleasure in crushing these silly young men—is more frightening than the nastiness of Oz. As always, the zealots went too far for their own good. Many people of civil‐libertarian views shed no special tears over the conviction—until the judge sent the three editors to jail for a presentence “examination” and the prison authorities cut their long hair. That seemed, as a respected legal journal put it, a deliberate assault. At that point hardly anyone con ceived that the sentence could be more than a fine. The jury had ac quitted the editors of the really seri ous charge, conspiring to corrupt the morals of children, and returned guilty verdict on the run‐of‐the‐mill count of publishing an obscene work. Then the judge, as if determined to prove Oz's case against society, im posed prison terms of up to fifteen months. Why do men in power so often lack the sense to know the proper limits in such cases? It is like the episode of Ralph Ginzburg, the Amer ican magazine pornographer with whom few sympathized until the Su preme Court reinterpreted the law ret rospectively to put him in jail. When dealing with social excesses, author ity should take special care to show restraint and common sense.

1271-> Harald Lander, Choreographer And Danish Ballet Master, Dies
COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Sept. 15—Harald Lander, Dan ish ballet master and choreog rapher, died here yesterday of leukemia. He was 66 years old. Mr. Lander was ballet master of the Royal Danish Ballet for 19 years, and under his guid ance the company and its prin cipal dancers established an in ternational reputation. His re vival of the repertory of Au gust Bournonville, the Danish choreographer and ballet mas ter, was largely responsible for the company's success. In 1951 Mr. Lander left Den mark to become ballet master at the Paris Opera. He created about three dozen ballets, but will be remembered best for his “Etudes,” which has been danced by many different com panies on three continents. Mr. Lander returned to Den mark a few months ago after an absence of 20 years. Mr. Lander's “Etudes,” a work that has been in the repertory of many major ballet companies, was performed most recently by the American Ballet Theater at the new John F. Kennedy Center for the Per forming Arts in Washington. Mr. Lander also choreo graphed “La Sylphide” for Ballet Theater. He was born in Copenhagen and received his early educa tion and dance training in the Royal Danish Ballet School. In 1923 he became a full fledged member of the Royal Danish Ballet Company and six years later its leading dancer. He was ballet master from 1932 to 1951. Mr. Lander was appointed ballet master of the Paris Opera in 1953 and director of the Paris Opera Ballet School in 1959. His works for the Paris Opera included “The Whims of Cupid” and “The Ballet Mas ter,” based on his own version of the ancient Vincenzo Gale otti ballet, which he had orig inally presented in Copenhagen In 1933. Earlier in his career, Mr. Lander studied in the United States with Michel Fokine, Ivan Tarasoff and Juan de Baucaire. As a dancer, Mr. Lander's leading roles (up to 1945 when he retired as a performer) in cluded Gennaro in “Napoli,” Don Alvarez in “Far From Den mark,” Man in “Bolero” and Toreador in “The Toreadors.” Between 1931 and 1951 he choreographed many ballets, some of the best known being “Bolero,” “Seven Deadly Sins,” “Thorvaldsen,” “La Valse,” “Spring” and “La Vida Es pagnola.” Mr. Lander returned to Copenhagen in 1962 as guest choreographer to re‐stage “Etudes,” which had not been performed there since his de parture in 1951. Mr. Lander's first wife, the former Margot Florentz‐Ger hardt, died in 1961. His second marriage, to the former Toni Pihl Petersen, ended in a di vorce in 1965, Both were lead ing ballerinas in the Royal Danish Ballet. He leaves his third wife, Lise.

1273-> 4 Lost Photographers Presumed Dead
SAIGON, South Vietnam March 2—An American official here said today that the four photographers on a Vietnamese. helicopter that crashed in Laos Feb. 10 “mus now be pre sumed dead.” An aerial search of the crash site in the Laotian mountains about 10 mires, across the bor der has produced no evidence that anyone survived when the helicopter was hit by antiair craft fire, and went down in flames, he said, although ef forts will continue until the site is actually reached. The passengers included Larry Burrows, staff photog rapher for. Life magazine; Kent Potter, of United Press Interna tional Henry Huet of the As sociated Press, and Keisaburo Shimamoto, who was on assign ment for Newsweek magazine. They and two key staff offi cers of Lieut Gen. Hoang Xuan Lam, who commands the South Vietnamese operations in Laos, were on an observation flight that strayed over an area of heavy antiaircraft fire,” accord ing to Lieut. Gen. James W. Sutherland Jr. In the nine years he spent in, Vietnam Mr. Burrows, became an international legend as much; for his to age, as for his pho tographic eoverage of the war He couldhave had safet assign rents but he wanted to cover the Vietnam Warao its end. His deepest wish, he had said, was to live long enough to be around to photograph both South and. North Vietnam in peaceful times.” In a recent tribute, Ralph Graves, managing editor of Life, said: “I do not think it is demean ing to any other photographer in the world for to say that Larry Burrows was the single bravest and most dedicated war photographer I know of.” Mr. Burrows; who was 44 years old, covered military activity in many parts of the world Ira Leba non, Iran, Cyprus and the Congo as well asyietxxam—but he did not want to be considered only a war photographer He also covered bullfighting With Ern est Hemingway, a European bar tenders convention, Billy Gra ham's tour of Ennland the Bris sels Fair and features on albino. kangaroos'; birds of paradise, the Taj Mahal and Angkor Wat in Cambodia: In the Jan issue of Life, Mr. Barrows had story about a young Vietnamese boy crip pled in to war who had been brenght to the United States for treatraent. Mr. Burrows cov ered the boy's return to South Vietnam and reunion with his family. That article also was the subject of a sequence The a tele vision documentary, “The Pho tographers” that was produced by Time‐Life Films for the Al coa Hour. Mr. Burrows was born in London on May 29 1926. He first joined Life in October, 1942, to work in the photo dark room of the magazine's London office. Soon he was taking pho tographs for Life's bureau there. In 1962, the year he went to Vietnam, his name appeared on Life's masthead. In 1967, Mr. Burrows was named magazine photographer of the year by the University of Missouri's School of Journal ism for his war coverage as well as for feature photographs. He was twice awarded the Over seas Press Club's Robert Cape Award for “superlative pho tography.” When he, came back to the United States to accept the award as magazine photogra pher of the year,Mr. Burrows was asked how he could stand the constant brutality of war. He replied: “I was in blitztorn London before I had the equipment or the ability to express my feel ings. That had a great deal to do with my keenness now to show the interested people and shock the uninterested into re alizing and facing the horrors of the Vietnam war.” Mr. Burrows lived in Hong Kong, where he would fly to be with his ‐wife the former Vickie Dickens, whenever he could break away from assign rents in Vietnam. In addition to his wife, Mr. Burrows leaves a son, Russell James, a senior at the Univer sity of California at Los An geles, and a daughter, Deborah Anne, who is in school in Hong Kong. Mr. Huet, 43, who was born in Vietnam, had much experi ence photographing the long warfare in his country. His work included three years as a combat photog rapher with the French Army, from 1949 to 1952, as France sought to retain a foothold in Indochina. Photographs that he took at great personal risk in January, 1966, of the battle at Anthi between Vietcong and United States troops were among those that won for him the Overseas Press Club's 1967 Cape Award for “superlative still photography requiring ex ceptional courage and enter prise.” He was born in Dalat in 1927, the son of q French offi cial and a. Vietnamese mother. As a child he was taken to France and lived in Brittany; where he received his educa tion. He was a French citizen. He enlisted in the French Army and in 1953 joined the United. States Economic Mis sion in Vietnam, serving also as a photographer for the United States Information Service.

1274-> George Widener, Racing Figure, Dies at 82
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 8—George D. Widener, one of the most honored figures in thoroughbred racing, died today at Erdenheim Farm, his Chestnut Hill estate. He was 82 years old. Mr. Widener was honorary chairman of the Jockey Club and the New York Racing Association, having stepped down as chairman after long years in both offices. He was also chairman of the National Museum of Racing in Saratoga Springs, where his erect patrician bearing and courtly manner in victory and defeat had made him him a favorite of the racing world for many decades. Last August ill health kept him from receiving in person the first “Exemplar of Racing” award at the Saratoga meeting. Mr. Widener was born in Philadelphia, a son of the elder George D. Widener and the former Eleanore Elkins. He was educated privately and at the deLancey School here. His grandfather, Peter A. B. Widener, was a Philadelphia businessman whose investments in the street‐car industry in major American cities made him one of the country's leading financiers. He was also a noted art collector and philanthropist. His father and older brother, Harry Elkins Widener, a. Harvard graduate and bibliophile, died in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. Their mother presented the Widener Library to Harvard in his memory. Mr. Widener carried on a family tradition as chairman of the Philadelphia Museum or Art, and by building in 1954 an 80‐room structure for the Widener Memorial School for training of handicapped children. It is now part of the Philadelphia school system. But the tradition closest to his heart was horse racing, in which his uncle Joseph E. Widener was a leader. In 1913 the George D. Widener silks—light blue and dark blue hoops and dark blue cap—first appeared on the tracks. In 1916 Mr. Widener began raising thoroughbreds at Erdenheim Farm, and at Old Kenney Farm in Lexington, Ky., which he sold in 1962. That was the year in which his colt, Jaipur, won the Travers Stakes, a victory that had eluded Mr. Widener for many years starting in 1918. Jaipur, a sentimental favorite because of his owner and a betting favorite because of his promise, defeated Ridan by a nose. The time equalled the track record. Jaipur also won the Belmont Stakes that year, but had not been a candidate for the Kentucky Derby, the first of the contests in the Triple Crown for 3‐year‐olds. The Preakness is the second. Mr. Widener's colors were never entered at the Derby. His other well‐known horses included Eight Thirty, Jamestown, What a Treat and Bold Hour. Mr, Widener's wife, the former Jessie Sloane, who raced horses under her own colors, died in 1968. He leaves no immediate survivors. The funeral service will be at 3 P.M. on Friday in St. Thomas Episcopal Church, Whitemarsh.

1275-> A Brazilian Youth's Joys and Shocks:' Plantation Boy' Opens at 5th Ave. Cinema Benjamin Proves Deft Comic in 'The Steagle'
Cinema Novo, the Brazilian moviemaking movement dedicated to a re-examination of, if not an outright break with, their film Establishment, is generally complimented by "The Plantation Boy," which began a two-day stand yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema.As a remembrance of pleasant things past and auguries of a sadder future, it is a bittersweet blend of a somewhat disjointed memoir of a boy's joys and shocks and an oblique reflection on a benign, autocratic, landed society being pushed toward mechanization.Walter Lima Jr., who wrote the script and made his feature directorial debut with "Plantation Boy" in 1965, shot his film in Paraimba, in rural north Brazil, which, to all appearances, must look like the 1920 sugar plantation setting of the original.While he has not extracted towering performances from his principals, most of his cast, especially the titular hero, his grandfather and owner of the plantation, and the boy's aunt and uncle, are natural in their reactions to the serious and rare lighter episodes in the drama.Carlinho, the boy sent to the plantation after his mother has died, is exposed to a world he never knew including a variety of relatives, the mechanics of the plantation, a rural school, a young aunt he loves dearly whom he loses when she marries; a pet lamb he loses to the butcher; the death of a young cousin; a Negro farmhand literally put in stocks for refusing to marry a girl who says he violated her; his doting grandfather proud of his acres but aware that prompters for a refinery are closing in and the frolics at a sylvan pool with a visiting young girl.Savio Rollm, a dark-haired, introspective youngster who plays Carlinho with subdued sincerity, gives credibility to these varied vignettes, including a tearful farewell as he leaves the scenes of his childhood for school. Rodolfo Arena portrays his grandfather, an austere gentleman with cane and a straw sombrero, to the manner born. Anecy Rocha is properly affectionate as his aunt and Geraldo Del Rey, as his uncle, does well by a changing character as he is smitten by an unrequited love and the desire for industrialization.If "Plantation Boy" merely hints at outlaws who sometimes preyed on these tracts a half-century ago, "Memories of the Cangaco," the documentary on the bill, also made in 1965, focuses on these bands, their leaders and pursuers. Authentic old and new footage underlines that they were either brigands or peasant Robin Hoods in rebellion against the army and the police in a strange record that is hardly the touching matter that "Plantation Boy" is. With literal English subtitles for the Portuguese dialogue, the tandem does, however, give us a sharp view of hitherto largely vague people and places. THE PLANTATION BOY ("Menino De Engenho"); directed by Waller Lima Jr., adapted by Mr. Lima from the novel by Jose Lins de Rego; produced by MAPA Filmes/Glauber Rocha; photographed by Reinhaldo Barros; music by Pedro Santos; Released by New Yorker Films.

1276-> DR. JOSEF CERNY, CZECH PATRIOT, 86
Dr. Josef Cerny, the last surviving member of the preWorld War II government of Czechoslovakia living in the free world, died on Tuesday at Goldwater Memorial Hospital. He was 86 years old. Dr. Cerny was a member of Parliament, Minister of the Interior and later political leader in‐exile in this country. In the United States, he renewed the activities of the Czechoslovak Agrarian party and became a vice president of the International Peasant Union and a member of the Committee for a Free Czechoslovakia. He was also a member of the Czechoslovak delegation to the Assembly of Captive European Nations. Dr. Cerny was born on Feb. 28, 1885, in Nepolisy, Bohemia. He attended Vienna University and received his doctorate from Charles University in Prague in 1911. In 1918, when the Czechs and the Slovaks founded an independent state, the Agrarian party, whose chief program was the social advancement of the peasant masses, named Dr. Cerny to the Prague Revolutionary Parliament. He served as a, of Parliament during the 20‐year existence of prewar democratic Czechoslovakia, which is also called the Masaryk Republic. After the partition of Czechoslovakia at Munich in 1938, Dr. Cerny tried to preserve national unity and stability in his dismembered country. When the Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia, he took a strong stand against the invasion, retired from public life and became part of the anti‐Nazi underground. He was jailed by the Germans, but the court that tried him refused to con demn him, stating, “Dr. Cerny was an apostle of uncompromising patriotism and of social and political peace; he demonstrated his love for the Czechoslovak Republic in our nation's most difficult days.” After the Communist putsch of 1948, Dr. Cerny left the country and eventually game to the United States. He leaves his wife, Helena, the daughter of Antonin Svehla, who was Prime Minister of the republic and a close friend of Thomas G. Masaryk. A funeral service will be held at 11 A.M. on Saturday at the Cooke Funeral Home, Third Avenue at 85th Street.

1278-> 5,741 SEE NETS WIN IN OVERTIME
WEST HEMPSTEAD, L. I., Jan. 24— The largest crowd of the season in Island Garden— 5,741—saw Rick Barry score 9 points during a five‐minute overtime period today to lead the New York Nets to a 108‐107 victory over the Utah Stars. Barry shared the spotlight with another émigré from the National Basketball Association, Zelmo Beaty, who defected to the American Basketball Asso ciation after seven seasons with the St. Louis and Atlanta Hawks. It was Beaty's first ap pearance in New York since he switched leagues at $650,000 for four years, and he con tributed 26 points to Utah's muscular offense. But Barry, held to 2 points in the third quarter and 4 in the fourth, broke loose, after the teams ended the regulation game at 97‐97. He scored two layups, one jump shot and three free throws in the Nets' 11 points and finished with 29. It was the largest Sunday crowd for the Nets and fell only 87 customers short of their record gate last March 6 against Pittsburgh. “The A.B.A. has come along way,” commented Beaty, a 6‐ foot‐9‐inch center with a 24‐ point average. “You can't come in and walk, over them. In the N.B.A., some of the big centers won't go out side and challenge you the way they do here. “Rick Barry? He's the same old Barry. You perfect things the way he does and they work in any league.” Barry had things working in this league all weekend. Yesterday, in the A.B.A. All Star game, he scored 10 points in the last nine minutes as the East defeated the West, 126‐ 122. Today, he scored 14 points in the first half, which ended with Utah 1 point in front.

1279-> Dance
OBODY, it is said, loves an albatross. The other day a City Councilman, Carter Burden, was reported as saying: “We're now reaping the benefit of the insanity of building Lincoln Center in the first place. It's become financial albatross.” The strange and florid imagery apart — Mr. Burden is politician and must be permitted his linguistic excesses — the thought, or lack of it, is so appalling coming from someone actually elected to have the interest of the city at heart, that it seems worth discussing. Mr. Burden was giving his opinion on the wisdom of City Center's assuming responsibility for the Vivian Beaumont Theater. This strikes me as a question less interesting than it seems — except for one thing. City Center will win the battle, such as it is, because City Center is putting up a most attractive financial packet to the Mayor and City Council. City Center is offering to pluck the albatross. It doesn't matter that City Center tried for years to run its own dramatic repertory theater with such a notable lack of success that it finally abandoned the project. It doesn't matter at all that the two most powerful men in the City Center organization, Norman Singer, the Executive Director, and Richard M. Clurman, the Chairman of the Board, have, so far as know, and I am proud to count them both as friends, no experience whatsoever in running a drama theater. It doesn't matter that the proposal involves the destruction and possible reconstruction of the Forum Theater. It doesn't matter that the plans considerably reduce the storage area available to the Lincoln Center Repertory Company and thus restrict the company's possibilities of moving into “revolving nightly repertory,” without which it will never satisfactorily function as a theater company of international standing. It doesn't Matter that the Henri Langlois Cinémathique (an admirable film collection, I understand) is going to be moved into the Vivian Beaumont Theater, with the multidollar construction of three or four new and tiny cinemas. New York is always in sore need of cinemas, and it certainly doesn't matter that the Langlois collection could go elsewhere, or that the Lincoln Center project originally was to be devoted to the performing arts, while the cinema, in its possibilities, needs and economics, is not a performing art, for as product a film is more like book than a play or a con It doesn't matter that in the reconstruction of the Beaumont Theater the Saarinen façade may be disturbed, if only to insure that Mr. Langlois has his name up in suitable lights. It doesn't matter that this probably will happen to the most distinguished‐looking building in Lincoln Center. It doesn't matter that, when the existing City Center building is pulled down and an office block put in its place with a theater underneath, this process will take about three years, during which time there will he no City Center. It doesn't matter that the City Center Joffrey Ballet will be definitely harmed during this period (it will probably he offered alternative accommodation at the ANTA Theater, but this will prove inadequate), nor that American Ballet Theater will be bereft of winter quarters. None of this matters the slightest bit. You can form as many committees as you like. You can write letters to the Mayor, to the City Council, to anyone you can think of. You can persuade such theatrical dignitaries as Dore Schary and Joe Papp to go to City Hall wielding baseball bats and it will not make one iota of difference. The new scheme for City Center's further take‐over of Lincoln Center is, mes enfants, in the bag. It is question of money. When Councilman Burden talks of Lincoln Center in terms of “insanity” and “an albatross.” he is not just talking for himself. His view is typical of rich, uninformed Americans (uninformed on this point, that is) from sea to shining sea. Lincoln Center is an albatross because it doesn't pay for itself — right? Of course right, Councilman Burden —you tell it the way it is. Schools are albatrosses too — and do all those hospitals show a profit? Couldn't a few be closed, or at least be adapted to show movies on Saturday mornings to help lessen the deficits? I wonder whether it ever occurs to men like Councilman Burden that Lincoln Center is intended to be a financial albatross. It is meant to lose money. In fact, it is meant to lose a lot of money. I never hear people in Paris talking of the Opéra as a financial albatross. An artistic disaster, yes, but never a financial albatross. In London people don't complain about, supporting Covent Garden, or the Royal Festival Hall, or the National Theater. Many German cities pay far more for their opera, bal let and theater than New York City does. To move nearer home, I must say that they organize patronage of the arts in Canada far better than we do. But in the United States in general, and in New York City in particular, despite the great work of the New York State Arts Council, the National Endowment for the Arts and various foundations, money comes before art. On Jan. 1 the New York Public Library's Theater Collection at Lincoln Center is going out of business for lack of funds. The Dance Collection — which is part of this — is the greatest collection in the world, of incalculable value to scholars and to the public alike. Perhaps City Center should take over the library — I am sure a few cinemas could be fitted in somewhere. The loss of the Theater Collection as a public service will be a tragedy — a small tragedy it is true. City Councilmen such as Mr. Burden will not have to lie awake nights worrying about it —these problems are not like poverty or adequate housing. This year the Eliot Feld ballet company was lost. There was a lack of public support for it — I feel it might have done better in Manhattan but it somehow did not take root in Brooklyn, where it made its home — and, eventually, lack of public funds. I am reminded of the Netherlands Dance Theater. More than 10 years ago this company was in the gravest of difficulties, with little money and scanty audiences. Yet the Dutch Government and the City of The Hague, backed it consistently. Now it can come to the United States as a goodwill ambassador, and it is mentioned in airline advertisements as a tourist attraction. The Eliot Feld company will now he neither. In the arts, economics must not always be allowed to prevail. Lincoln Center is not “insanity” and never was “insanity.” Admittedly, from a town planning point of view, it would have made more sense to have put the constituent buildings and the institutions they house in different parts of town. But had this been done, Lincoln Center would never have been built. It was the grandiose concept that caught New York's fancy, even, suspect, the fancy of men such Councilman Burden. What has been achieved at Lincoln Center is magnificent. We have seen in less than a decade the classification and formulation of an academic establishment for the American performing arts. The performing arts — if we are to have them at all —demand such an establishment, if only, to be unnecessarily cynical, as a point of departure for revolt. Every civilized nation in the world has its equivalent of Lincoln Center, but, they don't all have the equivalent of Councilman Burden. I don't mean to attack poor Mr. Burden personally — he is probably a decent enough fellow — but merely what his perhaps hastily expressed view means in New York City. You cannot cut corners and create certain kinds of art. You cannot judge a scheme — such as the City Center take‐over of the Vivian Beaumont — entirely on its financial implications. And yet this is certainly how it will be judged. City Center has put together a very, very appealing financial deal and the City Council will buy it like a shot. Prices rise, money gets short, and the money for the arts gets shorter. Yet the prices for the arts also rise. All our performing arts institutions are going to be in grave trouble in the next few years. Already too much creative energy is spent in empty fund‐raising. And behind it all is the same attitude that can call Lincoln Center a financial albatross. Forget the albatross. Think of Lincoln Center as one of the few things that make New York City habitable. If you are financially inclined, as I presume Councilman Burden is, think of the increase in real estate values around Lincoln Center, or merely think of the value of Lincoln Center as a tourist attraction. After all, how many tourist attractions does dear old Fun City have left? So perhaps nobody loves an albatross; but perhaps more people love Lincoln Center than the money men have dreamt of. One thing, however, is certain. No one, positively, no one, loves dead albatross.

1280-> HARRIS CAPTURES SKI JUMP TROPHY
BEAR MOUNTAIN, N. Y., Jan. 24—Dave Harris, a 24‐ year‐old draftsman from Brat tleboro, Vt., who has been jumping off ski hills for 16 win ters, scored the most important triumph of his career today. The lanky 170 ‐ pounder soared 160 feet in a six‐man jumpoff to win the B. B. Hans sen Trophy by fractions of a point from two rivals. Beaten were Thorbjorn Ryen, the Nor wegian‐schooled skyrider, and Selden Hannah, the former Dartmouth College star. Harris, averaging 15.5 points for style of a possible 20 points for his flight—it was the long est standing one of the day— emerged with 108.8 jump‐and style points. Ryen, after a jour ney of 159 feet, received a total of 108.7 while Hannah, with an effort of 156 feet, tal lied 108.1. The close finish provided a fitting follow‐up to the annual two‐jump Telemark Trophy tournament, which attracted 31 performers and was witnessed by a colorfully clad crowd of 23,000. Unexpected long flights by jumpers, surpassing even their own expectations, were liberally sprinkled through the program. Spectacular spills also spiced the session, held in tempera tures 10 degrees above freez ing. The worst fall was experi enced by Fred Way of Mount Beacon, who has been traveling long distances all season, though only a Class B jumper. Way, setting the pace for the entire tourney after the first round with a 153‐foot journey, went all out in a second plunge down the 50‐meter slope. He timed his takeoff superbly and seemed in complete control as he leaned over his ski tips after becoming airborne. However, the Mount Beacon star leaned forward too far and too long. He still had his arms stretched far in front of him as he neared the landing area. Be fore he could make an adjust ment, he went crashing on the slope, his head coming within inches of striking his ski tips and the ground. He was helped from the hill but remarkably suffered no injury. “I don't know why I did what did,” he said later. “I guess I just froze in the air.” Had Way been able to remain on his feet, he would have posted the day's longest flight —a 162‐footer. As it was, he eliminated himself from con tention and set the stage for Harris's unexpected victory in the jumpoff.

1281-> Leaders of the Chinese Taste Revolution: Those Elusive Chefs
In the days when a Chinese meal was nothing more than chop suey, chow mein, one from column A and one from column B, probably nobody in America ever stopped to think about who the chief was. But now that more or less authentic Chinese food from several region notably Peking and Szechuan has gained a serious, following, the Chinese chefs have emerged as figures of the same importance as French chefs — but the Chinese are much more elusive. These mysterious chefs are the subject of constant speculation by Chinese restaurant buffs. Few of them speak English, the best did their training on the Chinese mainland, and they hop from restaurant to restaurant, leading their fans a merry chase. “The chefs float,” explained Robert Tsang, Secretary of the Chinese Restaurant Association, which represents over 600 of the more than 1,000 Chinese restaurants in the metropolitan area. In order to hold on to his own chef at the Mon Sing Rice Shoppe (65 Mott Street), Mr. Tsang made him a partner. And most Chinese restaurateurs would probably agree that Mr. Tsang took a wise step. Their operations are by and large very unstable, since their nonunionized staffs also float. At the lowest level, busboys and kitchen helpers who chop away interminably at bok choy and chicken, will leave for another job one rung up the ladder as soon as they have a few months' experience. Some of them are illegal aliens, seamen who have jumped ship and do not have the official immigrant's “green card” (which is actually blue.) This situation is common enough so that at least one prominent Chinatown restaurateur apparently felt no qualms about telling a reporter recently that he had discovered only that morning that be had two shipjumpers on his payroll. But the upward and lateral mobility of choppers is not nearly so important as the perpetual motion of chefs. Take Wang Yun Ching, 64, of the Peking Restaurant (2512 Broadway), who was working until recently at the Empress Restaurant in Washington, D. C., and used to give cooking demonstrations on local television. Suddenly, the ambitious new Szechuan Restaurant at Broadway and 95th Street plucked him away from the capital and set him up on the Upper West Side. Word got around. But just when the lines began forming at the Szechuan as if it were showing first‐run movies, Mr. Wang moved a block downtown to its new sister restaurant, the Peking. After a certain lag, the lines moved too and made his lamb with scallions a word‐of‐mouth best seller. With bushy eyebrows and a face that somewhat resembles Chou En‐lai's, Mr. Wang has been a man in motion for most of his career. Born in a small town in Hunan Province, he began his nine‐year apprenticeship in nearby Cheng‐Chow and moved through several other jobs until he reached the summit of his mainland career in the late forties at the Shao Yu Tien in Hankow. The restaurant specialized in wedding banquets and birthday or longevity parties. A staff of 180 in the kitchen served literally thousands of people at a time, while opera performances were presented on a stage at the rear of the enormous dining room. Mr. Wang's training was traditional and laborious. During his first year he was not allowed to touch food at all. He washed floors, learned how to slaughter poultry, and he watched what the chef did. The second year he was taught how to build the brick event then in use in China and how to preserve food—there were no refrigerators —by cooking it until it was half done. The third year, the curriculum consisted of slicing and chopping so that all the solid ingredients of a dish would be the same shape and ready for the chef to cook. The fourth year, he worked on preparing cold dishes, making them beautiful and exotic, turning cold cuts into a dragon, or a phoenix, or a picture, and learning to dye foods for artistic effect. Then came the time, at last, when Mr. Wang was allowed to cook, but he was only trusted to make food for the employes. And even when he had been at work for nine years and ostensibly had proved himself, he was given his own work and allowed to cook for customers but watched closely by the chef for another two years. Lou Hoy Yuen, 52, the chef at the recently opened Szechuan East, (1540 Second Avenue at 80th Street) started work even earlier in life than Mr. Wang. He began his apprenticeship at the age of 8. An orphan, he never finished primary school, but practiced his trade at a succession of restaurants in Chengtu, Chungking, Shanghai, Taiwan and Hong Kong. On a trip to Japan after the war, he met the Chinese painter, Ta Chien, a gourmet who hired him as his personal chef and took him to Brazil. In Brazil, he met the shipping magnate, C. Y. Tung, who invited him to work at the Four Seas on Maiden Lane in New York. The Four Seas, now defunct, was one of the earliest, if not the first, New York Chinese restaurant to serve the spicy dishes of Mr. Lou's native Szechuan Province. It was a haven for celebrities during the sixties—I. M. Pei, the architect, brought Jacqueline Kennedy; Danny Kaye ate there—and Uncle Lou, as he is known, was in the kitchen from 1963 to 1968. Then, just as Szechuan food began really coming into its own here, Uncle Lou left for Tokyo to escape friction with the staff at the Four Seas. “I was still young and wanted to learn something,” he said in an interview through an interpreter, gesticulating and laughing frequently as he told his story. Meanwhile, David Keh, a waiter at the Four Seas, opened the Szechuan Taste in Chatham Square, against the advice of many people who thought New York was not ready for an exclusively. Szechuanese restaurant. Mr. Keh not only proved them wrong but has subsequently had a hand (and a piece of the action) most of the other Szechuen restaurants that have sprung up around Manhattan in the past four years, including the Szechuan on upper Broadway where Mr. Wang once worked. Mr. Keh floated uptown and finally crosstown to Second Avenue for his biggest gamble of all, a Szechuanese restaurant on the East Side. He opened the Szechuan East this fall on the site of a French restaurant from which he inherited several hundied bottles of wine he can't use. And from Japan he brought beck his old friend, Lincle Lou, to be his chef. Mr. Lou has a room over the restaurant where he naps between 3 and 5 in the afternoon, but the rest of the day he is in the kitchen where he makes hot spicy shrimp or Szechuan beef in a few seconds of final cooking at his large wok when a customer orders it. He purposely tempers the amount of oil and hot seasoning in his dishes “for Americans.” But Uncle Lou's food will still strike most people as hot. He does not, however, think it is possible to make some great Chinese dishes at all in America. He has in mind one of the canonical eight great dishes of Chinese cuisine — camel's hump. Here is a recipe for a dish he does make regularly at the Szechuan East: salt  1. Take the shrimp, salt, 1 teaspoon of the wine, black pepper, and egg and mix well together. Add undissolved cornstarch. Mix again. 2. Put 2 cups of oil in a wok or a skillet over high heat. Add shrimp when oil but not smoking and stir fry for about 5 seconds. Drain shrimp. 3. Clean wok, discard oil and mix in it the chill paste with garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sugar, remaining wine and MSG. 4. Put wok over high heat until mixture bubbles. Then add tomato sauce, shrimp, cornstarch dissolved in chicken broth, scallions, ½ teaspoon oil and vinegar. 5. Stir fry for a few seconds, remove from wok and serve. Yield: two to three servings. Note: All special ingredients in this recipe can be purchased in Chinatown markets.

1282-> Dollar Firm Abroad
LONDON, Dec. 22 (UPI)—Currency operators sat on their profits from the dollar's devaluation today and the United States currency rode high for the second day on some of Europe's main exchange markets. The expected outflow of the billions of speculative dollars that flooded into Europe in the months of the money crisis gambling on a lower priced dollar still failed to materialize. In the second trading session since the Washington agreement realigned major currency values Europe's exchanges stayed quiet and orderly.

1284-> Garden and Home
EVERY conscientious automobile owner knows that there are certain things he should do at this time of year to get his car ready for the coming winter months — but the homeowner sometimes forgets that there are also a number of important steps that should be taken to get his house ready at the same time. A few weekends spent in inspecting critical areas and making needed repairs now can go a long way toward making the house more comfortable during the cold weather that lies ahead, and toward lowering future operating and maintenance costs. To help the homeowner give his house this kind of pre‐winter “tune‐up”, here is a list of some of the more important items that should be checked each year around this time — while there is still time to make arrangements for any repairs that may be needed. On a mild, dry day when there is relatively little wind the homeowner should climb up to the roof and look over the shingles to see if any are missing, badly cracked, or curled up by the wind. Patches to replace cracked or missing shingles can be most easily made by cutting a sheet of aluminum to a suitable size, then slipping this under the defective shingle and cementing it down with roof cement. Shingles that have been lifted or curled up by the wind can be cemented down with the same material. If possible, avoid using nails, but if necessary, galvanized roof nails with large heads should be used and these should be located so that the heads will be covered by the shingle above if at all possible (hold the shingle up out of the way while nailing). Then cover the head with cement. Flat roofs don't have shingles, but they often do have a coating that has to be renewed periodically. If the surface looks very dry with lots of fine cracks, a non‐fibered aluminum‐asphalt roof coating works well. It is applied with a large roofing brush, or with a wide paint brush. If there are wide cracks or open seams, then a fibered coating should be used (this is a heavier bodied material). While checking the roof, the gutters should also be inspected at the same time. If the hangers or supporting straps are loose so that the gutter sags, these should be tightened or replaced to keep melted snow or water from accumulating and overflowing the rim instead of running off rapidly. (Accumulated water can build up ice dams in freezing weather and cause damage to roofs and inside walls.) Leaves and other trash should be removed from the gutters at this time and, if not already in place, screens placed over gutters that are under or near trees to keep leaves from being caught on the inside. These screens snap on over the rim so that leaves or other debris can't get inside. Wire cages can also be placed over downspout openings to keep the leaves from being washed down into the downspout where they can cause clogging. Leaks and rusted‐out sections of the gutter can be patched with special kits that are sold in most hardware stores, or with alternate layers of roof cement and aluminum foil. Spread the cement on, then cover with aluminum foil and cover with another layer of cement. Then repeat with one more layer of each. This material is required around all door and window frames to seal any cracks that occur where the frame meets shingles, siding, stucco or brickwork. If the calking compound is dried out, cracked or missing entirely, it will not only allow water to enter the walls and framework of the house, it will also allow cold drafts to enter, thus permitting a great deal of heat to be wasted. As a rule, new calking should not be applied over old material. It is best to scrape most of the old compound out first, then apply fresh material with a calking gun. The newer butyl rubber or acrylic latex compounds will last longer than the older type oil‐base calkings, and they should be applied to all seams where two different surfaces meet or where two different kinds of material join (brick and wood, shingles and brick, etc.). In addition, calking should be applied around all vent pipes or other openings in walls or roofs, as well as where posts rest on wood or concrete floors. Although concrete, brick and stucco are inherently weatherproof it is important that cracks be repaired or filled before freezing weather sets in to minimize the chance of moisture penetrating. If water enters a crack and then freezes it expands and opens the crack still more, until it eventually splits the surface badly or causes whole sections to loosen and break away. This is particularly true in stucco or brickwork. To fill cracks, especially small ones, the easiest and strongest material to use is one of the new vinyl or epoxyfortified patching cements. These are powders that mix with water and they will hold in thin sayers and in small cracks without need for prewetting or cutting out to enlarge the crack. They can also be used to cement back loose bricks or patch broken corners. Although most homeowners decide to paint only when appearance makes it seem necessary, it must be remembered that outside paint is also an important protective coating. Therefore, even if a full paint job is not required, any bare, cracked or peeling areas should be touched up promptly to keep water from entering and keep the condition from getting worse. The water supply to any faucets on the outside of the house, or in unheated garages or porches, should be shut off before freezing weather arrives to prevent pipes and fittings from bursting. Turn off the water from the inside (if there is no inside valve, have one installed now), then open the outside faucet and leave it open for the winter. If by any chance there is a low spot in the exposed piping between the inside shut‐off and the outside faucet, then the pipe will have to be drained — even if this means disconnecting it (a plumber can also install a special drain valve, or rearrange the nine it is self‐draining). Some houses also have pipes that run through unheated areas (garages, crawl spaces, etc.), making them susceptible to freeze damage in very cold weather. The easiest and surest way to protect these pipes against freezing is to wrap them with an electrical heating tape, sold in most electrical supply houses and many hardware stores. These are available with thermostatic controls that will turn them on automatically when the temperature drops to the critical point, and they can be plugged into any outlet. They are spiral‐wound around the pipe to hold them in place. PING: No heating system could keep a house warm if all windows and doors were left open all the time — and a house without insulation or weatherstripping is almost as bad. Heat is allowed to escape so rapidly that there are not only exceptionally high fuel bills, but in extreme cases the house never does get really comfortable and warm without cold drafts. So if the house does not have insulation; at least in the attic, and weatherstripping on all windows and doors, now is the time to correct this. There are many kinds of weatherstripping that the do‐it‐yourselfer can install, and insulation can be simply spread over the attic floor between the beams if the floor is unfinished. In addition to weatherstripping, all windows should also have storm sash installed to cut down on heat loss through the glass, and to make the house more comfortable (cold surfaces nearby make one feel as though he is in a draft). Storm doors are also advisable for the same reason. If it was not checked during the early spring or summer, then the heating system should be serviced now. A professional serviceman should he called in to vacuum out the firebox, to check the chimney, to adjust the various controls, and to see if any other repairs are required. If the house is heated by a forced air system, then the filters should be changed and the fan belt on the blower checked. On all modern heating plants there are motors and burners that need lubrication—usually at least two or three times a year. If in doubt about where to apply oil or grease, and what kind, then consult the man who services the unit.

1287-> Japanese Go to the Hustings Here
The other day in Chicago, John D. Gray, the chairman of Hart‐Schaffner & Marx, told a blue‐ribbon panel of Japanese executives to “stop acting as a defeated nation.” Shortly afterwards in Portland, Ore., Japan's Ambassador to the United States, Nobuhike Ushiba, predicted that his country would match or surpass the United States in handing out foreign aid to the tune of $4‐billion by 1975. Last Monday, here in New York, a day‐long meeting of the Far East‐America Council of Commerce and Industry heard Sumio Nara, the president of the Bank of Tokyo, promise that Japan, which is now shifting from a debtor to a creditor, would cooperate “wholeheartedly” with the United States in helping others. A day later Yoshizane Iwasa, the chairman of the Fuji Bank, told a forum arranged by the First National City Bank and the Japan Productivity Center that his country was hit hardest by President Nixon's program to stop the gold drain. Mr. Iwasa, who has kept a busy traveling and speaking schedule in the United States since Sept. 19, was joined by Shintaro Hayashi, a top official of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and Koji Kobayashi, president of the Nippon Electric Company, as well as other industry and government officials. To the casual observer, the frequent exposures of these visitors to American audiences may appear as part of an operation “hardsell” in the wake of President Nixon's new economic program. The Japanese deny this strongly. They argue that their efforts are primarily directed at opening a new dialogue with their American hosts. “We have discovered a disturbing communications gap,” one executive acknowledged. American business leaders who have met with the visitors agree with the latter point and have welcomed the face‐to‐face confrontations. They are less than convinced that the alarm over President Nixon's tough economic program (the 10 per cent import surcharge, the untying of the dollar from gold and the investment tax credit for domestic business) has not produced the increased influx of the visitors from Japan. Carl A. Gerstacker, the very globally minded chairman of the Dow Chemical Company who is also a vice chairman of the Advisory Council on Japan‐United States Economic Relations, said jokingly the other day that he met more frequently with Japanese visitors than with his own company president. More seriously, Mr. Gerstacker said: “I know better now what they are. They have a very good point on their side by arguing that they must trade in order to pay for raw materials. “However, the problem is that their exports have grown so rapidly that the total balance of U.S.‐Japanese trade has turned untenably in their favor. They can have it with another country, but not with a highly developed market as that of the United States.” It was at the Chicago conference of the Midwest‐Japan Association (Mr. Gerstacker was there) that a group of Japanese executives headed by Kazutaka Kikawada, the chairman of the Tokyo Electric Power Company, heard an American executive charge their country with economic nationalism. Although visibly stung by the charge, which they quickly denied, the Japanese business leaders nevertheless acknowledged that the discussions with their American counterparts had made them realize that the United States had “exceedingly serious” problems that must be solved on the basis of multinational cooperation. Norishige Hasegawa, the president of the Sumitomo Chemical Company, who had warned the conference that Mr. Nixon's program made an improvement of United States‐Japanese economic relations more difficult, admitted that the Japanese people had not been aware of the “gravity” of the United States crisis. The Chicago meeting, as well as others held by different sponsors in New York, Philadelphia, Portland, San Francisco, Houston, Dallas, New Orleans and other cities may not have shared the joviality displayed early in the summer at Farmer City, Ill., where Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc., entertained 2,000 farmers at a picnic for producing millions of dollars worth of soybeans and corn sold to Japan. However, all the efforts, as the Japanese see it, had the identical purpose of creating closer links between the two sides. The Chicago meeting elicited a promise from the Japanese to study more purchases from farmers, manufacturers and raw‐material producers in the Middle West. Fuji Bank's Mr. Iwasa who followed the line that it was not enough to send Kabuki players around the United States, but that the American‐Japanese relationship must be “personalized,” also came forth with several practical proposals. Speaking in Los Angeles, the banker proposed that the two sides study the possibility of establishing jointly owned export companies in the United States along the lines of Japanese trading companies. He said that Japanese export companies would provide their most experienced export managers to work with American businessmen to sell American goods to every nation in the world, including his own country. At the same time, he said that Japan was planning to send a purchasing mission to the United States to look for more export commodities suitable to the Japanese market. Meanwhile, Mr. Ushiba, Japan's Ambassador to the United States, is roaming the country on his own, delivering two or three speeches a week. Sources close to the diplomat said last week that Mr. Ushiba's biggest concern centered on his fear that Americans did not have accurate information on his country's progress in trade liberalization ana economic cooperation with underdeveloped nation. Another of Mr. Ushiba's concerns, the sources said is that Japan is becoming a scapegoat for Americans concerned “over essentially domestic economic weaknesses and distortions.” Interviewed at his Washington office by telephone, Mr. Ushiba said that many of his speeches had been scheduled before Mr. Nixon's program was announced. The diplomat said that the lack of communications between the two countries was much more serious than he had thought previously. To bridge the gap would require a fundamental approach that would include mutual education in the cultures of both nations, Mr. Ushiba said, adding that more stress must be put on letting young people visit the others' country. Although he would not comment on reports that both the Japanese Government and industry were planning to increase expenditures to improve Japan's image here, the Ambassador said that he had recommended to his superiors in Tokyo that the next budget include provisions for accelerated student and teacher exchanges.

1288-> FIVE THEATERS JOIN IN CHILDREN'S FAIR
Five theater companies are participating in the current State Theater Fair for Children. The weekend programs, geared for youngsters from 5 upward, and sponsored by the New York State Council on the Arts, began last Saturday with performances by the Paper Bag Players. On March 20, the series will conclude, shifting from Lincoln Center's Forum Theater to the downtown Bil Baird Puppet Theater on Barrow Street. As a sample, last Sunday's matinee presentation of “Song of the Black Journey” by Voices, Inc., a black musicaltheater unit, proved to be excellent entertainment, specifying spectators from 5 to 15 years old. The 12 on‐stage players at the Forum used songs, chants, dance and pantomime to depict a trek through the past, from the origin of slavery in America, through the emergence of Freedom. The players were remarkably vivid and supple, led by a dignified, deep‐voiced narrator and performing only to drum accompaniment until the finale. The sharp lighting and the exotic African costumes gave the one‐hour production striking, professional color. Best of all, the strong, candid tone of the text was transmitted in simple but effective terms of character‐building to the youngsters, who also responded warmly to some humorous byplay and poetic jingles.

1289-> Vatican's Choice of Bishop Widens Conflict With Dutch
THE HAGUE, Jan. 4—The appointment of a conservative priest as Bishop of Rotterdam has set off a new round in the conflict between the Vati can and the Roman Catholic Church in the Netherlands. The Pastoral Council, a dem ocratic advisory body of priests and laymen in the diocese, de clared officially that it would make every effort to bring about the withdrawal of the nominee, the Rev. Dr. Adrien Simonis. The 14 deans in the dio cese also tried to persuade the new bishop to refuse the ap pointment. The deans, feel that Dr. Simonis would not be able to cooperate in good progres sive spirit with the six other Dutch bishops. But Dr. Simonis said he was not prepared to step back. Conflict Over Celibacy On Saturday, the new bishop held a three‐hour private talk with Bernard Cardinal Alfrink, Primate of the Netherlands. Both refused to comment on their conversation, but they asked all Dutch priests to re frain from mentioning the con flict at Sunday mass. The Cardinal and the Dutch church differ with the Vatican on the question of celibacy, Which the Dutch feel should be optional for priests. Dr. Simonis supports the Vatican's stand on compulsory celibacy and is one of the few members of the Dutch hierar chy who oppose birth control. Cardinal Alfrink is scheduled to visit Pope Paul on Jan. 18. This visit was arranged be fore the nomination of Dr. Simonis. The Cardinal's, talk with the Pope was scheduled to deal with the celibacy issue. Informed sources believe the new dispute over the appoint ment of Dr. Simonis will also be discussed. Dr. Simonis is was appointed following a poll among Rotter dam church members on the qualities they expected in their new bishop. The Rotterdam Pastoral Council used this poll as the basis for their recom mendation of eight names to the Vatican. At a protest meeting of the Pastoral Council in Rotterdam, the board described the proce dure of the bishop's nomination by the Vatican as “unaccept able.” The criticism was first lev eled at the nuncio in The Hague, Msgr. Antonio Felici. A spokesman for the nuncio ac cused the Pastoral Council of having manipulated the list of candidates. Second on the List At several stages diocesan institutions and councils of priests and laymen were able to present names for this list. Dr. Simonis was second on the list. He gathered 15 per cent of all the votes. A special coun cil of priests finally made the definite proposal. On the list, Dr. Simonis became number eight. The chairman of the Pastoral Council said at the protest meeting that the authorities in the diocese did not consider Dr. Simonis a candidate with any overriding qualification. He added: “The nuncio and the Vatican gave the impression of using secrecy in their procedure for the nomination of the best can didate, in their view. The rec ommendation of the diocese was overruled by means of power. We fear that the diocese will be unmanageable and as a church, fall apart.” The council's declaration called the nomination of Dr. Simonis an attempt to frustrate the Dutch episcopacy and to break the progressive trend, which has been accelerated by the bishops, in the Dutch church. A committee of diocese au thorities now will try to find a basis for cooperation with the new bishop. Dr. Simonis is the first ordinary chaplain to have been made a bishop in Holland. He said in an intervievi, “I do not know the Pope's line of thought, but I do know that the situation has to be in balance and that unity on the level of the episcopacy must show to full advantage, too.” The new bishop added that “right thinking people are aware of the dangers of the reforms in the Dutch church. They want protection. They miss unity of creed.”

1290-> WASHINGTON REPORT
WASHINGTON — Businessmen traditionally have held a dual attitude toward making their voices heard in matters involving the Federal Government. Where there has been a specific impact on a specific company—what seemed to be a heavy tax, a burdensome regulation, an unreasonable restriction —business executives have not hesitated to march on Washington personally and also to hire top legal, lobbying and other talent to get their views across. Where the impact has been ‐less specific, however—where the policy perceived to be a bad one is expected to have generalized consequences for their company — then business executives have generally stayed at home rather than tangle with the politicians and the bureaucracy, or both. Thus it is, for example, that business executives have hardly ever testified before Congress on such matters as education, welfare or space budgets. They left the expression of business opinion on such iss—Jes to such organizations as the chamber of commerce, which, despite its large membership, often has less impact than one identifiable, plain‐spoken corjorate executive. The concept that it is best for a businessman not to get into any fights with the Government unless there is a direct and substantial corporate interest at stake seems to have led many businessmen into not even inquiring whether they have such an interest, unless that interest is immediately apparent. The latest such case in point involves the decision of the Nixon Administration to shake up the personnel of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is responsible for the preparation and analysis of many of the most basic economic statistics, including the employment and unemployment figures. The shake‐up has been explained as a move that is aimed at better coordination, uniformity, and so on, but the plain fact is that some statisticians of unimpeachable competence and integrity are being shunted into less important work because they have refused to interpret the statistics as their bosses wanted them to. The dissatisfied bosses include Secretary of Labor James D. Hodgson as well as the President. One of the main individual victims of the shuffle, though not the only one, is Harold Goldstein, who has long been the Assistant Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics responsible for the employment and other manpower figures. Mr. Nixon and Mr. Hodgson have been increasingly furious with Mr. Goldstein and some of his assistants —and at some others within the bureau who supported them, such as Peter Henle, the chief economist, who has also been reorganized out of a meaningful job. The reason for the fury is that these career bureaucrats would not make public statements interpreting the figures as their political bosses wanted them to. If a one–tenth of 1 percentage point drop in the unemployment rate was not statistically significant—as it is not—Mr. Goldstein would refuse to say that it was, no matter what Mr. Hodgson or Mr. After a year of such tussles, the recent “reorganization” of the Bureau of Labor Statistcs was ordered. Not a single businessman or business economist has raised his voice in protest. The silence has continued despite an industrious effort made by the staff of Senator William Proxmire, Democrat of Wisconsin, to find an executive or economist from the business community who would testify at the Joint Economic Committee hearings on the matter. Many business executives obviously felt it was completely unnecessary to get into the fight because they saw no vital corporate interest at stake. All who are familiar with the process of collecting and processing the unemployment figures say that there is no way that even the most evilly intentioned person could actually alter the statistics without being caught. Since a whole data‐collection and processing system is involved, too many people would have to know. Changing just one figure—the politically sensitive over‐all unemployment rate, for example—would involve changing hundreds or even thousands of others. Since accurate numbers are, therefore, expected to continue to be available and since large corporations have experts on the payroll to make their own interpretations of the numbers, executives of large companies may feel that it does not matter what officialdom or the official press release says about the numbers—true, false or misleading. But only the largest companies have their own analytical resources. In addition, what the business executives who have failed to speak up may have forgotten is that the public interpretation of the figures, and not just the figures alone, establishes the climate in which economic policy decisions are made. If they see no danger to themselves and their companies in the not‐entirely‐accurate interpretations of the figures that are being made today by officials of the Nixon Administration, they might try to contemplate the results, some future day, when a Democratic administration is interpreting the numbers.

1291-> PITTSBURGH STRIKE CLOSES TWO PAPERS
PITTSBURGH, Jan. 3—News paper pressmen went on strike today, closing down the city's two newspapers, The Pittsburgh Press and The Post‐Gazette. Negotiators for The Press, which prints The Post‐Gazette under contract, had reached a tentative agreement Friday, which union officers said they would recommend to their members. The rank and file turned down the offer. Management had offered Local 9 of the Pittsburgh Newspaper Printing Pressmen's Union a $50‐a‐week raise over two years. The basic pay scale is now $173.85 a week. Spokes men for the union said the strike was the first called by the union since it was char tered in 1899.

1292-> Architect of the Capitol George Malcolm White
The Architect of the Capi tol is an architect. That seem ingly self‐evident statement is perhaps the most signifi cant one that can be made about the new holder of the $38,000‐a‐year position who is the superintendent of the nation's most important build ing. For more than a century, the post had been held by men who, what ever their other qualifications, were not practicing architects. Most recently, the Architect of the Capitol was J. George Stewart, an en gineer, who died last May at the age of 79 after serv ing 16 years. Man In the News Five weeks ago, President Nixon appointed George Mal colm White, a 50‐year‐old native of Cleveland, who is a vice president of the Ameri can Institute of Architects, to succeed Mr. Stewart. The choice gratified most mem bers of the highly organized profession, who had exten sively lobbied to have one of their number picked. Although less than two weeks on the job, Mr. White is closely familiar with the controversial aspects that have long embroiled the Capitol Architect. Yesterday, his first appear ance before a Congressional committee was a hasty one, occasioned by Monday morn ing's bombing of the Capitol. But he is fully aware that, like his predecessor, he will have to spend a good deal of time justifying to Congress. any action he takes with re spect to its home. At present, apart from widespread alarm over the bombing, there is sharp con troversy over a plan to ex tend the West Front of the Capitol several feet to add 168,000 square feet of space for restaurants, auditoriums, committee rooms and other facilities. Battle lines In and out of Congress have formed. The question is whether to spend $45‐million on the extension or restore the present West Front for something less than $15‐million. Some years ago, the expansionist forces, led by Mr. Stewart, won a simi lar extension of the Capitol's East Front. “I'm not committed to any fixed approach on what to do about the Capitol,” Mr. White said in his office yes terday after his Congression al testimony. Mr. White conceives his job as being largely advisory, providing Congress with expert guidance on the techni cal points of caring for the country's most treasured of ficial buildings. He is in charge of a staff of 2,000 that runs, in addition to the Capitol, the Senate and House Office Buildings, the Supreme Court, the Library of Congress, the Botanical Gardens and the power plant for the official buildings. A considerable part of the Capitol Architect's job is managerial, and Mr. White IS considered by persons in the building industry in Cleveland, where he has had an architectural practice for many years, to be a highly competent manager. His background is wide; he is not only an architect and an en gineer but also a lawyer and he has made a specialty of the legal aspects of the build ing business and the archi tectural profession. Since being appointed Cap itol Architect, Mr. White has rented a townhouse in the Georgetown section of Wash ington, where lie plans to move shortly from his Cleve land home. He was born in Cleveland on Nov. 1, 1920. His four children (he is pres ently divorced), ranging in age from 13 to 18, will re main in school in Cleveland. Appointment as Architect of the Capitol has traditional ly been considered a political plum to be dispensed to a faithful party worker. Mr. White is a registered Repub lican but scarcely a laborer in the party's vineyards. “I turned my station wagon into a sound truck and went around Cleveland campaign ing for Nixon in 1960 when he ran against Kennedy,” he said. “Politically, that's about as active as. I've ever been.”

1293-> AT HOME ABROAD
LONDON, Feb. 21—Boeing and Brit ish Aircraft Corporation officials held a joint press conference here the other day to promote their proposed super sonic transports, the American SST and the British‐French Concorde. They aimed to show that SST's would not harm the environment, but they did not stop there. Jet planes in general, they said, are “the cleanest means of transportation we know.... Busy airports are clean erthan the cities they serve. ... The more that people use jets instead of surface transport, the cleaner the world's atmosphere.” And the Con corde itself would be “a spectacular way of defending the environment.” Listening to that, one felt like Yos sarian—trap Ped in a lunatic world where the inhabitants talk sage non sense to one another. Just imagine what the world would be like if we followed aerospace logic and all the people who now travel by train or car or bus used jet planes instead. In that “cleaner” world the sky would be darkened by jets, the air filled with maddening noise; the planet would have to be paved over for runways. How can intelligent men live by such mad logic? It is not just money or corporate loyalty that moves them. It is a burning belief in the cause of airplanes and, more broadly, tech nology. With all respect for sincerity, their cause is our enemy. It is the cause of the machine, oblivious to the human values that we must restore and nour ish if our civilization is to endure. There is no clearer test of the op posing values, human and technolog ical, than the supersonic transport. As a machine, it has a powerful appeal. Even the skeptical environmentalist might find himself drawn to the brute beauty of the Concorde prototype as it roars overhead on its test flights. But by this time we surely know that there are other considerations. In terms of both economics and human tranquillity, these weigh overwhelming ly against the SST. Concorde has already cost the Brit ish and French Governments $1.2 bil lion for development, and that figure will probably double before the end— little of it likely to be recovered even, if production models are sold. The plane will carry 108 to 126 passengers across the Atlantic, one–third the ca pacity of a 747. The seat‐per‐mile cost to the airline using Concorde will be double that of a 747, and the pas sengers would therefore have to pay much higher fares. Crossing the At lantic would take seven hours instead of ten, door to door, if there are no landing or ground delays. At supersonic speeds, Concorde causes a boom whose devastating im pact even the SST promoters do not deny. They say that the plane will not be allowed to fly over populated places. But given the economic yearning for more routes, Charles Lindbergh was inevitably correct when he said re cently that he did not believe such promises could be “practical or lasting.” In any case, the noise made by Con corde as it lands and takes off will be substantially more painful than the maximum now permitted by London airport authorities or the Federal Aviation Agency for new subsonic planes. The position of Concorde's pro moters is that it should be allowed to make more noise. Why? Because other wise their machine cannot work: ma chines before men. A Briton who symbolizes the ideol ogy of the machine is visiting the. United States this week to argue against noise limits that would affect Concorde. He is Anthony Wedgwood Benn, who as Minister of Technology in the late Labor Government became a cartoonists' figure of fun with his earnest manner of saving souls by technology. It was Benn who applaud ed and supported, as a superb example of British technology, the RB‐211 en gine contract that has just sunk Rolls Royce. While Benn is In America, the voices opposed to Concorde are growing stronger in Britain. A leading opponent, Richard Wiggs, has just published a compelling book, “Concorde: The Case Against Supersonic Transport” One important point he makes is the way backers of SST's have used the fear of trans‐Atlantic competition: Concorde is sold here as necessary to fight the Americans, the Boeing plane over there as essential to compete with Concorde. Congress ought to be able to pene trate that sham when it votes again soon on the American SST. For the truth is that the British Treasury would dearly love to be relieved of Concorde, and more and more inde pendent analysts are coming to agree with the view of Concorde taken by the Spectator, a conservative weekly:. “The non‐flying majority is not only subsidizing the rich flying minority with its cash. It is also putting up with the very great nuisance created by that rich flying minority. Seldom can,. a majority have been more strenuously taxed to benefit a minority and, at the same time to deafen and to poison itself.”

1294-> Siffert Gains the Pole For Austrian Grand Prix
ZELTWEG, Austria, Aug. 14 (UPI)—Jo Siffert of Switzerland won the pole position for to morrow's Austrian Grand Prix by clocking the best time turned in at the closing quali fying session today. Siffert, driving a British Rac ing Motors (BRM) car, clocked the best lap time of 1:37.44 minutes on the 3.6‐mile Oester reich‐Ring circuit. Jackie Stewart of Scotland, the favorite to take the 1971 world championship, had the second best time of 1:37.65 and will be in the front row, to gether with Siffert. The final qualifying runs were marred by an accident, Jackie Oliver of Britain had brake trouble with his Bruce McLaren‐Ford and had to drive into the crash barrier. Oliver escaped unhurt but his car was badly damaged. The left rear wheel was torn off in the smash‐up that occurred at a speed of 170 miles an hour. “The brake caliber came off,” said Oliver, “and I suddenly realized that I had no other chnace than to drive into the barrier because the brake pedal did not react. “The car swung around and the rear wheel was torn off. I was really lucky.” Oliver said he will try to enter the race with the repaired car. “Jo Siffert showed in train ing today that he has improved considerably,” Stewart said. “I expect the toughest opposition to come from him.” Stewart named Emerson Fittipaldi of Brazil and the en tire Ferari crew as other tough challengers in the race. “They will all be very hard to beat,” Stewart said. “I haven't won the world title yet. After all, I dropped out of, the same circuit here one year ago in the first lap. Anything can happen but I'm aiming at a victory here to be free of all further worries.” Stewart, leading in the world championship standing with 51 points compared to 19 for Jack Ickx of Belgium, needs only a place in the top three to se cure the world title. A record crowd of 100,000 is expected, among them 20,000 Italians, who will be cheering for the Ferrari team.

1295-> The Judas Medicine
There is no more versatile or essential aid of modern medicine than the blood transfusions which annually save thousands of lives. But blood becomes a Judas medicine when it contains the hepatitis virus that can sicken or even kill the patient it is supposed to help. The menace has become greater recently with the spread of drug addiction since the use of unsterile needles by groups of drug addicts makes them particularly liable to hepatitis, and their blood is therefore particularly dangerous when it enters the supplies available for transfusion. The commercial blood bank which buys blood from impoverished donors—among whom narcotics addicts are likely to be numerous—is the channel through which most of this Judas medicine becomes available for use in unsuspecting patients. Some authorities in this country estimate that the chance of catching serum hepatitis from a blood transfusion is twelve times greater with blood obtained from commercial sources than it is with blood provided by voluntary donors. The annual toll in sickness and death from serum hepatitis in this country could be drastically reduced all blood transfusions were performed with volunteered blood. But there is large‐scale indifference to the need for more donated blood on the part of most healthy Americans. This failure of social conscience and enlight ened self‐interest creates the blood shortage that com mercial blood banks fill with frequently dire results. An effective national campaign is needed to help convince the American people that being a blood donor is an essential part of being a good citizen. In this era of, rising social consciousness and with Britain's excellent experience as an encouraging example, it should be possible to stimulate greater participation in the blood program once the facts are adequately explained.

1296-> Growing Coconuts, Way of Life
SANTA CRUZ, the Philip pines—When Alejandro Tope started growing coconuts here with his father a half century ago, their share of the earn ings amounted to 35 pesos a year. Now, on the same hold ing with the same number of trees, they are up to 280 pesos a year, or about $45. It provided for the family then, with little to spare. It does so now. With all the fluctuations in the world market for copra, with the change from United States rule to independence, with all that has happened in agricul tural technology, not much has changed for the coconut growers of Lagunas province south of Manila. old, stands straight. His head of white hair shows no gaps under the blue kerchief in which he binds it. His teeth are complete. He farms the 6‐acre holding, which he leases from Abelino Estrada, the city auditor, as did his father in 1920. His son, an invalid and a former policeman, lives with him, and three of his grand children help with the coco nuts and other crops. The earnings of this work support not only those five, but also his wife, his son's wife, three younger grandchildren and a great‐grandchild. The principal difference be tween Mr. Tope's life and that of the other generations has been education. All his grandchildren have been to high school or expect to go. Other changes—to the ten ant farmer's favor —have taken place in recent years. Mr. Tope's share of the harvest, one fifth, is up from the one‐seventh that used to be standard. And laws now make it difficult for a land owner to evict his tenants. Then, last November, came the worst typhoon this cen tury. Most of the cash crops were badly damaged, and Mr. Tope lost about 100 coconuts, as well as many flowers and buds. The trees will take three years to recover fully, he said. However, A. H. Reyes, director of the provin cial food and agricultural council, said he thought it would take only a year. “We'll see,” Mr. Tope re plied.

1298-> Books of The Times
REVOLUTION AS THEATRE. Notes on the New Radical Style. By Robert Brustein. 170 pages. Liveright. $5.95. It is superfically plain from a reading of the five essays and appendices in “Revo lution as Theatre” why Robert Brustein, dean of the Yale Drama School, does not rank high among the Yale student body's culture hercies—why he is regarded, ac cording to a recent article by Thomas Meehan in The Times Magazine, as “an autocratic. Tartar” and “a political hypo crite,” and why it has been, said by Yale students that “Everybody doesn't like somebody, but nobody doesn't dislike Robert Brustein.” Whereas once upon a brief time ago Brustein ventured forth as a champion of esthetic radicalism (even to the point of defending Barbara Garson's inflammatory “Machird”), he has ap peared during the last five years to be moving steadily to the right. Now in these essays he makes no hones of his belief in such battered virtues as discipline, author ity, and tradition, or his stern opposition to disruption of the classroom in the name of political justice, or, more specifically, his disagreement with Yale President Kingman Brewster's decision to shut down the university during last May's Panther trial demonstrations. Mr. Brustein is heavy, as they say these days; or as they used to say, he's a heavy father. Nevertheless, a careful reading of these essays Makes it difficult to argue, with him. For instance, it is hard not to ap plaud the statement in his title piece that “what this violent talk [of the counter culturel] signifies is that American revolu tionaries are impotent to act, and that they lack an ideology entirely, though they are hardly lacking in passions—thus, the weak ness for rhetoric and gestures, rather than programs and organizations.” And one is almost bound to applaud his tart account in “A Night at the Sympo sium” of how members of The Living Thea ter “spontaneously” employed storm trooper tactics in the name of liberty to disrupt an organized discussion of their aims (though one is tempted to argue that for all the outrage of the $10 cus tomers, the evening made its point more saliently than any “rational” discussion could have done). One must respect Brustein's firmly out spoken minority view of Yale's reaction to the Panther trial (“When the Panther Came to Yale”). And it is difficult to dispute the beliefs he sets forth in “The Crisis in the University” that professions involve skills, that skills can only be transmitted through careful teaching, that to teach skills requires authority (as op posed to unstructured freedom or authori tarianism), and that it is the ideal func tion of the university to provide a setting where authorities are free to impart skills that will create Professionals—regardless of the day's political issues. Why then, one wonders, did these es says arouse such tempers when they first appeared during the last two years in The New Republic, The New York Review. of Books, The New York Times Magazine, and Modern. Occasions? And why, even now, does one read them disputatiously, with a weather‐eye cocked for cracks in their logic, while, wrestling all the while with a suspicion that the radical Robert Brustein that used to be was simply hid ing his real conservatism from himself— even when this is clearly not the case (he remains, as he says just infrequently enough to make him convincing, pro foundly opposed to the war in Vietnam, and deeply concerned about the fissures in our dentocracy)? Why is he really un popular at Yale? It is partly a matter of timing. There can be little doubt left that students at Yale—like American students everywhere —had legitimate grievances when they be gan to challenge traditional education au thority and its “relevance” to their lives; there is, as Mr. Brustein would be among the first to admit, a profound distinction between unresponsive and responsive au thority—between a university that coldly and indifferently processes its students while pursuing corporate ends and one that acknowledges its students' needs with out indulging their every whim and temper. The assault on indiscriminate authority was at high tide when Mr. Brustein's es says first appeared; and it has still barely begun to ebb. A defense of legitimate au thority is hardly likely to be weldomed under such circumstances, if only because the tenor of any statement tends to be distorted the tenor of the times in which it appears. Gray appears whiter against a black background, and vice versa. The other problem raised by Brustein's essays is even trickier to pinpoint. It becomes more evident by the hour that most of us have both authoritarian and libertine aspects to our souls, and that most of us tend to oscillate violently be tween the two—to embrace one to the ex clusion of the other, especially when everyone around us is shouting. (Is it the nature of the human beast, or a peculiarity of our times?) Is it unfair to say that the contemporary student, sensing with his healthy quotient of libertinism (the phrase is chosen carefully) that the is being vic timized by authoritarianism, rebels and in the process often engages his authoritarian self? And that as a reaction, parents, fac ulty members, and other people with power, fancying themselves liberals, guilt ily detect their authoritarian impulses and react by swinging violently to their liber tine poles? To paraphrase the scriptures, there appears to be a time for discipline and a time for indulgence. Nothing in between. Besides, to judge from the lack of violente at Yale that dangerous week end at Yale, it works. Robert Brustein confuses things with these essays. At a time when the au thoritarian is out and the libertine is in, he is saying that there are finer distinc tions to be drawn. It takes courage to do that and he is bound to be damned for it. He ought not to be judged too quickly.

1299-> British Coal Chief Resigns in Dispute On Denationalizing
LONDON, Jan. 4—A sudden resignation tonight by the chairman of Britain's National Coal Board indicated that the Conservative Government had decided to sell off parts of the country's nationalized in dustries. Lord Robens, chairman of the coal board for 10 years, quit rather than preside over the dissolution of his empire. At a meeting of the board, he made it clear that the issue was the Government's refusal to let his nationalized enterprise decide for itself what fields it should enter. His resignation is bound to raise an outcry from the Labor party Opposition in Parliament, reviving some of the faded con troversy about nationalization. It could also arouse un rest among miners. The coal mines were nation alized by Prime Minister Clem ent Attlee in 1947. The miners used to be this country's most militant union members, with a record of fre quent strikes. In recent years, that picture has been trans formed, at least in part be cause of Lord Robens's deep personal identification with the industry and the miners’ con fidence in him. It was another Conservative Prime Minister, Harold Macmil lan, who gave the Coal Board job to Alf Robens, a Labor Member of Parliament, then made him a life peer. But Edward Heath is a different kind of Conservative from Harold Macmillan—more doctrinaire, more determined to get back on the path of free enterprise. Prime Minister Heath's Gov ernment had offered Lord Rob ens another five‐year term as chairman. But he refused be cause the Government would not give him veto power over sales of the Coal Board's side ventures. The board has invested, for example, in the search for natural gas in the North Sea, which could prove very prof itable. The board has some money‐producing chem ical plants. It makes bricks, and it leases some unneeded time on its computers to pri vate industry. He Stated Opposition These are among the activi ties that Lord Robens wanted to protect. A few weeks ago he said publicly that the Coal Board's ancillary businesses would be sold off “over my dead body.” His resignation, which has not yet been announced, quick ly become widely known in government circles. Lord Robens carried consid erable political weight. He was a minister in Mr. Attlee's Gov ernment 20 years ago, and he is a popular figure inside and outside the coal business. Just yesterday a minister in the Department of Trade and Industry, Sir John Eden, said firmly that nationalized indus try could not be sacrosanct in its present form. He indicated it would have to concentrate on its own prime activities and give up those that could be done effectively by the pri vate sector. “Nationalization as a politi cal act is a quarter of a cen tury old,” he said. “It is ob viously right to look afresh at these massive accretions of economic and industrial power —not only at their structure, but at their place in the in dustrial scene as a whole.” Pragmatic Approach Actually, Mr. Heath and his ministers may see their posi tion on some nationalized busi ness as pragmatic. That is, they may in some cases seek to avoid further wearisome ideo logical battles over the prin ciple of public ownership. Steel is the potentially signif icant example. There are indications—though no firm de cision yet—that the Heath Gov ernment will avoid any frontal attack on the recently national ized industry, but may instead try some method of giving pri vate shareholders a part of the equity. The Labor party will take a strong position against any piecemeal dissolution of the main nationalized industries, such as coal, steel, electricity, gas and the railroads. Labor will argue that it is unfair to the public to take any profitable sectors developed with public funds and sell them to private business. The Government, on the other hand, will say that its purpose is to develop units of manage able size. It will sell off some activities whether profitable or not.

1301-> Prague Group in Debut
Of the great church and court composers of the early Renaissance, Josquin des Prez ranked as the greatest, a Flemish musician whose im portance compares to Bach's or Beethoven's. He was the ideal artist, in fact: both innovator and consolidator, capable of refining the con trapuntal techniques of his day and yet willing to inject something new, a secular grace and a melodic expres siveness that keep his music from turning to dust in the way the works of some of his contemporaries can for us. So, after 450 years, it is no wonder that, to use what might be called button‐tense, Josquin Lives. The second concert in the astoundingly successful International Jos quin Festival, given on Tues day night for another over flow audience at Alice Tully Hall, put the composer's age less genius in perspectiye. The Prague Madrigal Singers, a chamber ensemble from the Prague National Museum, made its New York debut in a program consisting of mo tets, chansons and the “Missa Fortuna desperate.” There was considerable range of style, therefore, mov ing from the devout motets such as “Virgo salutiferi” and the powerful “Misericordiss Domini” through chansons of lament (“Regretz sans fin” and “Nimphes, nappes”) and erotic titillation (“Allegez moy”), finally melding sacred and secular in the mass, whose cantus firznus or base melody is an ancient Italian song, “Fortuna desperata.” The Prague group of 19, led by Miroslav Venhoda from his seat at a portative organ whose twin bellows had to be operated manually by a young aide, sang with the vibrato ‐ less elegance and slight nasality that is not out of place in such music. Old instruments such as krtunm horn and vielle were played ably, though not by any means to perfection. The performances accu rately reflected Josquin's strengths, too, though one could note intonation vaga ries, some shrilled top tones, and a prevailingly moderate approach to tempos that cost th program something in variety. Specialists of the pe riod might also have argued about such matters of per formance practice as a viol played with constant, modern vibrato and a bow held palm inward, cello‐style.

1303-> G.M. Seeks a rice Rise Of 3% on Its ‘72 Models
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23—The General Motors Corpora tion, which accounts for more than half the nation's automobile production, asked the Government today to allow a 3 per cent price increase on its 1972 models. The company filed a request with the Price Commission for an average advance of 2.5 per cent to reflect general cost increases and for one‐half of 1 per cent to cover the cost of new pollution control devices and improved bumpers. General Motors was the last of the four major auto makers to seek a price increase. Under the regulations of the second phase of the Nixon Administration's economic stabilization program, price increases in the industry cannot go into effect until they have been approved by the Price Commission. The American Motors Corporation, smallest of the four manufacturers, won a 2.5 per cent rise last week. The Ford Motor Company has sought a 2 per cent increase and was asked by the commission for more information to justify its request. The Chrysler Corporation, which has filed a request for a 5.9 per cent price raise, is understood to have amended its proposal and to have asked for somewhat less. A commission decision on Chrysler prices is expected tomorrow. In making its bid today, General Motors asserted in statement that its cost increases through the end or this year would be 4.9 per cent, even allowing for long‐range productivity in American industry as a whole. The company chairman, James M. Roche, said that these costs “indicated” a 4.9 per cent price rise. But General Motors is asking for less, Mr. Roche said, “to support the President's economic program.” “General Motors maintains its belief that only by support of the program can we achieve our national goals of reducing inflation, expanding employment and strengthening the dollar abroad,” he said. “Our application for less than a, cost‐justified price increase demonstrates our support of the program.” Mr. Roche said that “an essential part” of the effort to keep General Motors prices down called for the company's. thousands of suppliers to follow “a similar course of price. restraint.” “With widespread support,” the company chairman said, “the short‐term disadvantages will he far outweighed by the potential long‐term benefits of a strengthened American economy.” Under the Price Commission's rules, a gain in productivity, or output per worker, reduces the extent to which cost increases can he passed on to consumers. Long‐term gains for industry generally have been about 3 per cent. Mr. Roche said that more recent productivity gains, in the economy generally and in the auto industry in particular, had been “far short” of the long‐range level. The recent figures for General Motors could not be Immediately learned. A spokesman for the Price Commission said that, so far as he knew, the General Motors application was in order. This means the agency will rule on the 3 per cent request by next Monday. A special provision of the regulations promises 72‐hour service on answering requests for price increases from big companies that must pay wage increases before the end of the year. The auto companies paid one raise yesterday and will pay a second next month. It appeared that General Motors would be allowed to spread any granted price increase through its model lines as it saw fit. This would mean that the prices of some cars could go up more than 3 per cent and some less. Rise for Western Electric Presumably, a price increase would affect only new cars ordered after the advance was granted and would mean that dealers with cars in showrooms bearing the present prices would sell them at those figures. The Price Commission approved several price rises today. It allowed a request by the Western Electric Company, the manufacturing unit of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, for a 3.9 per cent increase on 55 per cent of its volume. The agency said that the impact oh total’ volume would be 2.1 per. cent. Also granted were price increases of more than 7 per cent for the tin mill products of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation and the National Steel Corporation. The commission said that the advances covered “substantial increased material and labor costs.” The increases were precisely what the companies requested. Bethlehem won a 7.6 per cent rise on tin mill products, which includes the steel used in cans and other packages. The product accounts for 10 per cent of the company's sales. The commission said that the price rise would increase gross revcosts.” The increases are precisely what the companies requested. National Steel was allowed 7.2 per cent advance. Tin mill products make up 25 per cent of its sales, the commmission reported, and the price increase will raise its total income 1,8 per cent. Before the 90‐day wage‐price freeze that began Aug, 15, the major steel producers announced price increases on their more important hot and cold rolled strip and sheet products, to take effect early next year. They are also expected to seek these rises from the commission. The agency has said it will allow companies to increase prices to reflect costs, less productivity improvements, so long as profit margins do not go up, and it said that the steel price advances granted today would not increase the margins. It hopes to hold price rises for the economy as a whole to 2.5 per cent. Policy Under Study The commission continued to work today on what could he major refinement of this policy. It wants to limit business in passing on to consumers the most inflationary wage rises scheduled under contracts negotiated before the freeze. This impulse is primarily result of the controversial pay increase granted the coal miners by the Pay Board last week. An agreement reached before the freeze ended would give those workers an immediate raise of at least 15 per cent. The commission is thinking of making its tougher stance known in a decision on the first request for a price increase filed with it by a coal producer, a source close to the agency said. The Old Ben Coal Corpora tion, a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, is the only operation yet to have asked the Government for price increase. It filed for a 6.7 per cent rise last night. More Information Sought A spokesman for the cornmission said that, in trying to reach a decision that could be applied broadly, the agency wanted more information on, both the Old Ben request and The industry as a whole. A. ruling will be delayed while the data are compiled, the spokesman said. Meanwhile, the commission announced that any smaller retailer with sales of $100,000 year or less would be allowed to consider itself a “single department” in complying with regulations on the posting of ceiling prices on nonfood items. Merchants are required to post maximum prices either on items that account for half the sales in each department or on the 40 items with the highest sales volume in each department, whichever is less. The new ruling was important for thousands of retailers, such as small hardware stores, that were said to face difficulties in establishing different “departments” in connection with the regulation.

1308-> Newton Is Cleared of Charges in Slaying
OAKLAND, Calif., Dec. 15—After spending nearly two years in prison and standing trial three times, Huey P. Newton, the Black Panther leader, today won a dismissal of charges that he killed an Oakland policeman. The indictment, charging Mr. Newton with voluntary manslaughter, was dismissed by Judge William 3. Hayes on the motion of District Attorney Lowell Jensen. “I feel this is a frustration of justice and would prefer to retry the case,” the District Attorney said, “but I am compelled to ask at this time for a dismissal.” Mr. Newton was convicted in 1968, but the decision was overturned on appeal. He was tried twice more, but both trials ended with the juries deadlocked. Mr. Newton made no comment on the dismissal, but Charles R. Garry, his attorney, said the action was “long overdue.” Mr. Garry noted that his client had not only gone through three trials but that he had also spent nearly 23 months in prison and, prior to that, 10 months in pretrial detention. “And now,” he said, “instead of the court saying we're sorry, Mr. Newton, that we put you through this inconvenience — because the presumption is supposed to be that he is innocent — they act like they're doing him a favor.” Mr. Jensen, in his motion asking for dismissal of the charges, said that he had decided against a fourth trial because he believed that this jury, too, would be unable to reach a verdict. The dropping of the charges against Mr. Newton came just seven months after the dismissal of murder charges against Bobby Seale, the chairman of the militant Black Panther organization. Mr. Seale had stood trial in New Haven. Conn., charged with ordering the torture slaying of a suspected police informer who had allegedly infiltrated the party. When that jury deadlocked, the trial judge ordered the charge dismissed, saying that it would be impossible to find an unbiased jury for a second trial. Mr. Newton, now 29 years old, formed the Black Panther party here along with Mr. Seale, 34, in 1966. A year later, in October, 1967, Mr. Newton was charged with killing a policeman. In his first trial Mr. Newton was found guilty in September, 1968, of voluntary manslaughter. The state had sought a first‐degree murder conviction. Two years later that conviction was overturned by the California Court of Appeals. Mr. Newton has been free on $50,000 bail since August, 1970, two months after his conviction was overturned. He had been serving a 2‐to‐15‐year prison sentence at the California Men's Colony at San Luis Obispo. The shooting in which the katrolman, John Frey, was killed took place after Mr. Newton had been stopped tot a traffic check in a black neighborhood in Oakland. Mr. Newton and another patrolman, Herbert Heanes, were wounded. Mr. Newton was charged with assault in the shooting of Patrolman Heanes but was acquitted. In his testimony at the first trial, Mr. Newton denied having shot Patrolman Frey and said he was unconscious when the shooting took place. It was this point that led to the overturning of the verdict. The appeals court cited “omitted instructions” to the jurors as the primary reason for its decision. The court said that it was “reasonably probable” that, had proper instructions been given, the result would have been more favorable to Mr. Newton. The omitted instructions concerned the court's failure to inform the jury that Mr. Newton's contention that he was unconscious at the time or the shooting constituted a complete defense. The two subsequent trials proved the court correct. In the second, the jury voted 11 to 1 in favor of conviction. That trial was held last June. The third trial, which ended last week, also produced a deadlock. This time the vote was 6 to 6.

1309-> Enclave of Low Prices
SINGAPORE — Inflation, unemployment and high tax es, triple plagues of the United States economy, are problems with which this ministate's government seems to be dealing effectively. Unemployment caused by the closing of British bases is being offset by a rapid in dustrialization program. And Singapore's achievement in becoming what is generally recognized as the second richest country in Asia, after Japan, has been accomplished with only minimal tax increases. Although some private economists and businessmen suspect the Government of being too selective in its con sumer price index, even such critics concede that the cost of living for workers has been kept to acceptable levels. The Government permits substantial imports from Communist China, which en able Singaporeans to enjoy foodstuffs and other Items at rock‐bottom prices. For example, an ordinary white shirt that might cost $10 in the United States and $3 in Japan, if made in Communist China could be sold here for $1. The glut of rice in Asia has led to imports of that staple commodity at low prices and lessened the re public's dependency on Com munist Chinese imports. How ever, imports from China totaled $140‐million in 1969, and leading traders concede that these have had a major role in keeping down the cost of living for Singapore's low er and middle classes. Since the Government, un der labor legislation passed in 1968, has effectively frozen wage‐increase demands while it seeks to attract foreign in vestment for its industriali zation program, stable prices appear necessary for political stability. The International Monetary Fund recently put the unem ployment figure at 7 per cent. However, as a largely tradi tional society, Singapore has the extended family system, which provides food and shelter for unemployed relatives. Although unskilled work ers are having difficulties finding Jobs, there is a grow ing shortage of semiskilled and skilled technical and pro fessional personnel. The Government recently relaxed its stringent immigra tion restrictions to permit skilled professionals to enter. Many are coming from neigh boring Malaysia and farther away, Acting on advice from the International Monetary Fund, the Government has tight ened tax write‐offs for for eign investors. Except in spe cial cases, write‐offs for pioneer industries have been cut from 15 to five years. However, Singapore is looking for industries with higher technology to take ad vantage of its educated and disciplined labor force. It is no longer interested in just any foreign investor.

1310-> McCarthy Exhorts Youths to Remain Active in Politics
Former Senator Eugene J. McCarthy said yesterday that if the nation's 18‐to‐20‐year‐old youths merely waited passively to exercise their newly won right to vote on Election Day and did not remain active in politics, “we might have well been better off without it.” In his first speech before a college audience in New York since he stepped down from the Senate seat from Minnesota nine months ago, Mr. McCarthy said that in 1968 the nation's youths, while they did not have the right to vote at that time, were able to influence thousands of voters and eventually changed the thinking of the country. He said the youth movement had shown the inequities of the draft and had influenced Sendor Robert Taft Jr., Republican of Ohio, to introduce legislation calling for amnesty for draft resisters. “If you're only three years ahead of Robert Taft Jr., you probably weren't as revolutionary as people said you were,” Mr. McCarthy told about 650 students and faculty members at University Center, Adelphi University in Garden City. Afterward, in response to questions about his possible candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the Presidency, Mr. McCarthy said that he was trying to line up support among delegates to the Democratic National Convention from 10 states and that he was “closest to a decision” on entering the Wisconsin primary. “We haven't really excluded any [primaries], excepting New Hampshire, at this time,”, Mr. McCarthy said. When asked if he was announcing his candidacy at this time, the former Senator noted: “I have said that I'm quite willing to be the nominee.” He added that he would consider making a third‐party bid for the Presidency if the Demo crats did not “develop a position on the very important issues” and if they had “a very unrepresentative convention, as they did in 1968.”

1311-> Burns Named National Coordinator for the Lindsay '72 Committee
John J. Burns, Democratic state chairman, was named national coordinator for the Lindsay '72 Committee yesterday and given the task of drumming up support for the Mayor for the Democratic nomination for President. He will also make an assessment of that support and advise the Mayor whether to join the fight for the nomination and, if so, what primaries he should enter. Mr. Burns, who will leave his party post on Dec. 28, said at a news conference in the Summit Hotel, 51st Street and Lexington Avenue, that he was not “absolutely sure” the Mayor would run, but was “betting” he would. In a statement distributed at the hotel, Mr. Lindsay praised Mr. Burns as “a truly great state chairman during the past six years.” He said he considered the chairman's willingness to join the committee “personally gratifying and politically important.” Richard R. Aurelio, who resigned last week as Deputy Mayor to head the committee for which Mr. Burns will be working, told a questioner that Mr. Burns would be doing “a great deal of traveling throughout the country talking to potential supporters of the Lindsay candidacy as well as supporters.” “He will also help us set up a political structure, which he is greatly equipped to do, if Mr. Lindsay decides to run,” Mr. Aurelio said. “He is well known, respected and admired in many parts of the country by state chairmen and other professionals he has dealt with many times. We think he is a tremendous asset and that he will be very valuable.” Democratic leaders queried yesterday agreed with this assessment. Patrick J. Cunningham, the Bronx leader, said Mr. Burns would give the Mayor a Democratic “credibility” he did not have before. He noted that Mr. Aurelio and other leaders of the Lindsay committee, like the Mayor, were recent converts to the party. Mr. Burns, who has had close ties with Mr. Lindsay since he became a Democrat, said he had decided to leave his party post to give all his time and attention to his new “responsibilities.” “In this time of domestic and international crises, our people need a leader who can lead them in the way of settling our problems through mutual respect and brotherly love, instead of appealing to our baser instincts of fear, greed and hatred as we have seen spewing from the mouths of Nixon and Agnew,” Mr. Burns declared. He said that he thought the contest for the nomination was “still a very open situation” and that none of the present candidates had the kind of sup port “that could not be unglued,” Joseph F. Crangle, the Erie County leader, who is considered the most likely successor to Mr. Burns as state chairman, said yesterday that he would consult leaders across the state before deciding whether to seek the post. Most county leaders queried yesterday said it was too early for them to take a stand on a successor. Meade H. Esposito, the Brooklyn leader, said the state chairman traditionally came from upstate. While he described Mr. Crangle as “an old friend and an able young man,” he ;aid he would wait to see if le could get “the right kind of support upstate.”

1312-> 300 ATTEND RITES FOR JUSTICE LEVY
State Supreme Court Justice Matthew M. Levy was de scribed yesterday at his funeral as “a man of steel tempered with grace, humanity and dig nity.” He was eulogized at the Park Avenue Synagbgde, 50 East 87th Street, by an old friend, Dr. Robert McKay, dean of the New York University Law School. The hour‐long service was attended by more than 300 people. Dr. McKay spoke of Justice Levy, who died at the age of 72 at the Bronx‐Lebanon Hos pital Center Saturday, as a man who “never ran mindless in a pack” and who stuck by his affiliations with the Socialist, American Labor and Liberal parties when it would have been politically more advantageous to disavow his loyalties. Dr. McKay called Justice Matthew a rebel with a “life long record of protest and dis sent” and a “passion for justice and a sense of injustice.” On the bench Justice Levy was presented with a “dis proportionate share of difficult cases” because of his reputation for objectivity and skill in re solving them, Dr. McKay said. His home at 11 Fifth Avenue, Dr. McKay recalled, was a salon, a gathering place for lawyers, judges, writers and the like, who came to take part in the stimulating conversation of Justice Levy as well as the hospitality of his home with his wife of 49 years, Pearl Levy.

1313-> Clinton Prison Bans Inspection by Dunne
DANNEMORA, N. Y., Sept. 23—State Senator John R. Dunne, chairman of the Senate Committee on Crime and Cor rection, who is on a fact‐finding tour of prisons, was barred today from the Clinton Correc tional Facility here. The prison superintendent, describing the institution as “very tense,” expressed con cern for security and said he feared the taking of hostages by inmates. Among other developments yesterday in the aftermath of the rebellion at the Attica State Correctional Facility were these: ¶Another inmate of Attica, wounded by gunfire during the police assault on the prison 10 days ago, died in a Buffalo hos pital of his wounds, bringing the total number of dead to 41. ¶In Albany, more than 1,000 people, mostly white, rallied to protest the deaths at Attica and to call for the resignation of Governor Rockefeller. ¶In New York, two parallel efforts to draw up a prisoners' “bill of rights” were announced. ¶Several purported leaders of the Attica uprising issued a statement declaring their inten tion to “clog the Wheels” of “the vicious political machine that exists in all New York State prisons.” At the Clinton Correction Facility here, Senator Dunne, a Republican of Garden City, L. I., was denied permission by State Correction Commissioner Russell G. Oswald to interview the 146 prisoners sent to Clin ton from Attica following the rebellion. The prison superintendent, J. Edwin LaVallee, denied Sen ator Dunne access to any pris oners at all and would not per mit him past the prison's Administration Building. Clinton was the next‐to‐last stop on Senator Dunne's four day fact‐finding tour of the state's eight major penal insti tutions, and it marked the first time that he had received any thing but complete cooperation from superintendents, guardS and inmates. As he left the prison this afternoon, the Senator appeared angry. He said he was “sur prised and disappointed that I've been prevented from con tinuing my inspection of our state prisons, which was in tended to enable me to present a firsthand report to the full Senate committee when we meet in New York tomorrow.” “I shall have to discuss this incident, as well as other mat ters, with the committee and shall have to withhold any fur ther comment until that time,” he said. His disappointments contin ued at his last stop late today when he was informed by the, superintendent of the Great Meadow Correction Facility in Comstock, N. Y.—Joseph Con boy—that he could not meet with 462 former Attica inmates there unless he received prior permission from Deputy Attor ney General Robert E. Fischer. Mr. Fischer has been appointed by Governor Rockefeller to in vestigate the Attica prison re bellion. Mr. Conboy said, however, that Senator Dunne was free to tour other areas of the prison. Senator Dunne refused to call Mr. Fischer. He said he would enter the prison and abide by Commissioner Oswald's order not to speak to prison ers transferred from Attica. A Schenectady County As semblyman, Clark Wemple, Re publican ‐ Conservative, was permitted to interview Attica inmates at Great Meadow to day because, Mr. Conboy said, “he got permission from Bob Fischer.” Tonight Senator Dunne said that he had spoken by tele phone with Senator Earl W. Brydges, Republican of Niagara Falls and the majority leader of the Senate, who told him “he was getting a lot of heat” from other legislators over Senator Dunne's prison tour. Sources in Albany said late tonight that Mr. Brydges had relayed to Mr. Dunne the “of ficial feeling” of Governor Rockefeller that Senator Dunne should delay his committee's inquiry into Attica until the findings of the Fuld Commit mitte were in. Last week the Governor asked Chief Judge Stanley H. Fuld and the four presiding justices of the Appellate Divi sion to select a committee to investigate the events at Attica. The justices are still deliber ating on their selections.

1314-> Elementary Schools Show Another Drop In Pupil Enrollment
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7 (AP) —The number of children in elementary school this fall will decline for the second consecu tive year, in another note of bad news for aspiring teachers. The Office of Education, in its annual back‐to‐school statis tical roundup, said today that the sharp decline in births dur ing the last decade would cut attendance from kindergarten through the eighth grade this year to 36.7 million, a decline from 37 million last fall. The Government also pro jected 8,000 fewer jobs for elementary teachers‐1,308,000, down from 1,316,000—and said the slump would last for at least another five years. The Office of Education sta tistics followed a report from the Washington Center for Metropolitan Studies saying children under age 5 decreased from more than 20 million in 1960 to about 17 million in 1970. Underlining the immensity of education as an American busi ness, the education office said. 63 million persons—30 per cent of the population—would be in volved this year as students, teachers or administrators. The cost of public and private education will increase by $9,7 billion to $85.1‐billion. The education office said the slump for elementary teachers would be offset by a 27,000. increase in secondary school teachers and a 30,000 increase in the number of college and university instructors. In a related report released today the National Academy of Sciences‐National Research Council noted a marked worsen ing of job prospects for science Ph. D.'s who received their doc torates in 1970.

To the Editor: New York City's cultural priorities are distorted when the city spends $25 million to buy the Yankee Stadium and at the same time the public library system is in the midst of a job freeze with no end in sight. Many libraries have had to reduce hours, while others are running criti cally low on staff. The city should serious consider re organizing its priorities to try to raise the level of culture above peanuts and popcorn. New York, March 25, 1971

1319-> Beame Says Lindsay Errs By $330‐Million in Budget
Controller Abraham D. Beanie contended yesterday that Mayor Lindsay had overstated expenses and underestimated revenues by a total of $330‐million in his proposed $8.8‐billion city expense budget for the fiscal year starting July 1. For one thing, said Mr. Beame, the Mayor underestimated the revenues from the increased income tax and from three business taxes by one‐third. There was an immediate, tart denial of Mr. Beame's contentions by Mayor Lindsay and Edward K. Hamilton, the Mayor's Budget Director. Mr. Lindsay said the Controller's “recklessness was doing untold damage to the city.” If the $330‐million in extra money were available as Mr. Beanie said, it would be more than enough to run the city's Fire Department for a full year or nearly enough to operate all colleges of the City University. Calls ‘Track Record’ Bad But Mr. Hamilton assailed the Controller's calculations as inaccurate. “His track record on estimating budgets is so bad you'd think it ought to sober him a bit,” the Budget Director snapped during an informal City Hall news conference after learning of Mr. Beame's charges. Two City Council leaders—Majority Leader Thomas J. Cuite and Finance Chairman Mario Merola—announced that if Mr. Beame's findings were correct they would “slash the Mayor's tax package to ribbons.” The budget is now before the Council and the Board of Estimate for action by next Tuesday, and the Council will also be voting on the tax package needed to balance it. Yesterday a parade of speakers testified before the Council in opposition to the new taxes. 18 Months of Revenue At a news conference in the Municipal Building, Mr. Beame said that the administration had erred by estimating the collections from four prime items in the tax package—the increased income tax levy and three increased business taxes —on a 12‐month instead of an I8‐month basis. When the State Legislature voted last week to authorize the city to increase the four taxes it made the increase retroactive to Jan. 1, 1971. Since the budget now being adopted by the city runs until June 30, 1972, there will be 18 months of revenue from the increased taxes, Mr. Beame noted. He argued that the administration estimate of a $270.5million yield from increases in the income tax, the unincorporated business tax, the general corporation tax and the financial corporation ‘tax should have been $135‐million higher. Mr. Beame said that his analysis of the budget also showed that the Mayor had underestimated general, fund revenues by $108.5‐million and overstated expenditures by $76.6million. When the $330‐million total was put before Mr. Hamilton for comment, he said: “This is a shopworn technique which continues Mr. Beame's campaign to get us to build the budget on sand. Increasing revenue estimates is the gamiest financial device I can conceive of."’ Mr. Hamilton insisted that the $270.5‐million estimate for the yield from the four increased taxes was in reality an 18‐month estimate. He said further that’ the estimated yields from the taxes had been either calculated or approved by the State Division of the Budget. The Budget Director then explained why his estimate was so much lower than Mr. Beame's: the big item in the package, he said, was the personal income and commuter tax increase, expected to yield $190‐million. Generally the bulk of that tax is collected by withholding, but it is impractical to make withholding retroactive. Therefore the city plans to apply the increased withholding rate as of July 1, and taxpayers, including commuters, will be asked to file city tax forms next April 15 to report the extra taxes due between Jan. 1 and June 30 this year but not withheld. Mr. Hamilton said that it would be obviously much harder to collect the taxes tinder the voluntary reporting system than by withholding, but he indicated that was a one‐time occurrence. Accusing Mr. Beame of playing “fast and loose” with revenue estimates, the Mayor said that he had directed Mr. Hamilton to be prepared to answer to the City Council today “any and all questions on this matter so that the irresponsible statements will stop.” He went on to declare that the Controller's statements were “insulting” to every state legislator who supported the tax package. Mr. Hamilton, who has been budget director less than a year, said that the city was running more than $300‐million in the red in the present fiscal year largely because Mr. Beame last year had succeeded in getting revenue estimates pushed too high.

1320-> Lindsay Terms Spending Cuts by the G.O.P. Majority in the Legislature a ‘Tragic Political Spectacle’
Mayor Lindsay Issued brief, sharply worded state ment yesterday attacking the spending cuts fashioned by the Republican leadership in the Legislature. “Today the state started its new fiscal year without a budg et,” Mr. Lindsay said. “No budget is better than the budg et that had been proposed. “We have witnessed a tragic political spectacle in Albany this past week. The leadership stood apart from the minority. Partisan lines were drawn and the needs of our cities were ig nored.” The City Hall version of the budget battle contended that the Mayor had spent hours on the telephone in the last few days trying to persuade his friends in the Legislature to upset the compromise plan worked out by Governor Rock efeller. The reasoning was that de feat of the compromise budget would force the Governor to seek support from Democratic Legislators friendlier toward the cities. Mr. Rockefeller's aides had encouraged Mr. Lindsay to speak out, according to City Hall sources, predicting that attacks from the Mayor would stimu late Republicans in Albany to line up behind the Governor's plan in an effort to avoid a collapse that could give Demo crats the balance of power. The Mayor's statement was issued in mid‐afternoon yester day, just before it became ap parent that Republican leaders had lined up enough votes to pass the budget. “This is not a one‐party city or state, and the issues being decided in Albany are not Re publican or Democratic issues,” Mr. Lindsay said. “They will determine the number of police, firemen, sanitationmen and teachers in our cities for the next year. “It is not too late. The state must keep its commitment to the cities and every local gov ernment to provide revenue sharing at a level of 21 per cent. This was a solemn con tract and must not be broken.” “There is still time,” the Mayor declared, “for respon sible men of good faith from both parties to join together in Albany to reject this budget and to create a new budget that meets the critical needs of our people. “There are men in both par ties who care about human needs and bagic services who should join together in a coali tion to give our state a respon sible progressive budget.” City Hall also gave clearance for a long line of high‐level city officials to paint a bleak pic ture of declining city services before eight Democratic Assem blymen who hastily arranged a hearing in Manhattan yesterday morning. The officials warned that the new budget might result in more malnutrition among slum children, the end of rent con trol, larger classes in the public schools, the end of free tuition in the City University system, a reduction in the number of sanitationmen, increased wel fare rolls, more housing decay and a deterioration of medical care for the working poor. Edward K. Hamilton, the city's Budget Director, said the cuts in state funds would place “an intolerable and disastrous burden” on the city, which had projected a $300‐million deficit in its own spending this year and a $1‐billion deficit next year, even with the higher state aid it had expected. Mr. Hamilton was especially bitter about the cut in state revenue sharing. He said the Ggyernor had given city offi cals a firm commitment to share 21 per cent of state revenues with localities. “They have pulled the rug out from under us,” Mr. Hamil ton said. “For a Governor push ing revenue sharing on the Fed eral level, this is a lousy exam ple on the state level. It is negligent and irresponsible rev enue sharing.” In addition, he said, cuts in state funds could stimulate other monetary losses, since state money in some programs —such as Medicaid—is matched by Federal grants, which would drop as the state financing dropped. Benjamin Altman, Commis sioner of Rent and Housing Maintenance, deplored the cuts lin state payments for adminis tering rent control, making emergency repairs to ‐ apart ments and enforcing the Hous ing Maintenance Code. “It's the end of code enforce ment and the end of rent con trol,” Mr. Altman said. “It's highly conceivable that our emergency repair program will be scuttled as well.” Jerome Kretchmer, Environ mental Protection Administra tor, said that “it's clear that we will have to give up some of the sanitationmen” to shift funds to other city agencies that are paid for by the state. Dr. Seymour C. Hyman, vice chancellor of the City Univer sity, said the cuts might force “the implementation of some kind of tuition scheme,” as opposed to the free tuition that now exists. Jule M. Sugarman, Human Resources Administrator, said the reduction in the income levels at which families are eligible for Medicaid would probably force many onto the welfare rolls, where their medi cal expenses would be paid. Many also would shift from voluntary to municipal hospi tals, Mr. Sugarman said, bur dening the already crowded city hospital system. We said the welfare cuts would have the effect of reduc ing the daily food allotment from about $1 to 88 cents. “I think there is no question that children will be damaged by malnutrition,” Mr. Sugarman said. “School performance will be retarded. We'll be paying years from now for this. It is one of the most foolish short range decisions.” Gordon Chase, Health Serv ices Administrator, and Murry Bergtraum, president of the Board of Education, also de cribed reduced services, includ ing longer lines at clinics and larger classes in the schools. The hearing, held at 270 Broadway, was led by Assem blyman Stephen J. Solarz, a Democrat of Brooklyn, who— with his colleagues—was col lecting arguments to use in the Albany debate against the budg et cuts.

1321-> Alitalia $199 Youth Fare To Rome to Defy C.A.B.
Alitalia, the Italian airline, introduced a $199 youth fare between New York and Rome last night despite a ruling by the United States Civil Aeronautics Board prohibiting it, “Alitalia has no alternative but to comply with the Italian Government order establishing the $199 individual round‐trip youth fare for [travelers] 12 through 25,” Guido Vittori, the airline's United States general manager, said. He said some tickets at that price has been sold for two flights last night. He asserted that he had received no official notice of the C.A.B. ruling and no instructions from Rome to suspend’ sale of the low‐cost tickets. Mr. Vittori and spokesmen at the C.A.B. said they hoped the dispute could be resolved today The C.A.B. decision complicated an already confused trans‐Atlantic airline price war over youth and student fares. Passengers Not Counted No one has counted yet how many young Americans have taken advantage of the special fare, but a survey of major airlines yesterday indicated that the number was probably in excess of 3,000 and the peak of the rush is two or three weeks away. Carrying guitars, back‐packs, sleeping bags and even tents, dressed in blue jeans, long drer,sas and neater attire, the young people are flocking into airline offices and airports, often speanding hours shopping around for the best price. British Overseas Airways Corporation said yesterday that of 316 passengers on a Boeing 747 flight that left Kennedy International Airport Sunday night, 246 were youth‐fare pas‐, sengers. The British airline esti mated that 100 youth fare passengers are booked each day this week. Air France said it had carried or booked at least :3,000 youth fare passengers this week. Alitalia said it had reservations for 1,500 passengers on its $199 youth fare. But it remains unclear whether the line will be able to accommodate the passengers at the $199 price. The United States regulatory agency has essentially no jurisdiction to fix international air fares. But it says it can require foreign airlines to submit new fares to the board 30 days before they are to become effective. What it did in the case of the Alitalia fare was to refuse waiver requested by the Italian airline to introduce the fare in less than 30 days. It was the first time in the recent spate of fare reductions for students and young people that the C.A.B. had taken such a step. Sabena Starts ‘War’ Sabena, the Belgian airline, started the wave of fare reductions'for students up to 30 and other travelers up to age 26 two weeks ago. It introduced a student fare of $200 roundtrip ($220 peak season) between New York and Brussels, about $150 less than the lowest scheduled airline fare. More than a dozen transAtlantic airlines subsequently announced similar youth fares to cities in Europe. In each case, the Aeronautics Board allowed the airlines to introduce their bargains within a matter of two or three days—on what is technically known as “short notice.” Officially, the C.A.B. had no comment yesterday on why it rejected the Alitalia fare on short notice. But privately, officials of the agency said they felt Alitalia had gone too far in expanding the rate war. They said the $199 fare to Rome, on a per‐mile basis, provided a significantly greater discount to young travelers than other youth fares. Also, they noted that, unlike the other youth fares, Alitalia had imposed virtually no restrictions during the year when the fare could be used. The other lines charge extra for peak‐seats on flights and will not confirm reservations for youth fare passengers until periods ranging from 36 hours to seven days before departure. Alitalia said it had introduced the special rate at the direction of its Government, as had other airlines. Such Government orders allowed the airlines, under regulations of the 108‐airline International Air Transport Association, to break the association's fare schedule. Mr. Vittori said because of instructions from the Italian ‘Government “we must continue to apply this tariff pending the resolution of the dilemma through proper channels or courts.” Next Step Unclear The next step in the dispute was unclear last night. Late yesterday, Alitalia submitted a new request to the board asking for permission to introduce the fare on July 14 —giving 30 days notice—and again urging an expedited decision to allow the rate. As they prepared to board Pan American flight to London yesterday, two youths at Kennedy Airport in blue denims and khaki Army field jackets told a story typical of the young people shopping to get the best rate. “We hitch‐hiked from Wisconsin,” said one of the youths, Stephen Drew, a 21 year old student at Milton College. “We were going to take freighter or maybe a charter flight,” added his buddy, Ronald Turk, 20, of the University of Wisconsin. “'We read about the youth fares in the paper,” he continued, “and last night I walked all around [the ter minal city loop at Kennedy] to get the best deal. I talked to 20 airlines. We found deals as good as the $200 round‐trip to London here, but nothing better.” “We've got about $400 apiece and a tent; the air fare left us about $200,” Stephen added. “We think it can last us ten weeks. It's a great education.”

1322-> Shuvee Wins at Spa and Raises Earnings to $801,818, a Record for Mares
SARATOGA SPRINGS, N. Y., Aug. 23—Shuvee elevated her self to the topmost rung of the filly and mare division in earn ings when she won the $44,100 Diana Handicap today. Mrs. Whitney Stone's 5‐year‐old mare engaged in a bristling duel with James Drymon's Double Delta in the 1¼‐mile test, and managed to prevail by a neck. The victory was worth $26,460, which in creased Shuvee's earnings to $801,818, enabling her to pass the previous richest mare, Cicada, whose earnings amount to $783,675. Five were in the Diana, but the race was strictly a two horse affair after the field hit the far turn. Shuvee, who got off awkwardly, in last place, moved up to third under the guidance of Ron Turcotte at that point. Slow Pace to Stretch The pace, somewhat slow, was set by Double Delta, whose rider was Kenny Knapp. As she and Shuvee drew away from the others in the stretch, it ap peared that Double Delta would be able to hold off the strong favorite. But Shuvee, even with her top impost of 128 pounds, provided an excellent finishing kick to take the Diana for the second year in a row. Double Delta, the second high weight at 126, had 5½ lengths over the third finisher, Cathy Honey, with Watch Fob and Sailly Le Sec trailing in that order. Shuvee, timed in 1:50 ⅗, paid $4.20 for $2. The fractions were 0:25 ⅘, 0:50, 1:14 ⅕ and 1:38 ⅖. Shuvee is a 5‐year‐old Vir ginia‐bred daughter of Nashua and Levee and is trained by W. C. (Mike) Freeman. Lightly raced this year, Shuvee was starting for only the fifth time, and the success was her sec ond of the season, the previous one having been the Top Flight Handicap at Aqueduct.

1323-> Urban League Appoints a New Director
Vernon E. Jordan Jr., who at the age of 35 has spent his adult life seeking equality for his fellow blacks, was named yesterday to succeed the late Whitney M. Young Jr. as executive director of the National Urban League. In assuming the leadership of the powerful civil‐rights organization, Mr. Jordan — who is executive director of the United Negro College Fund —said he would seek to maintain “consistent dialogue” between black and white people, and did not believe in endorsing any political candidate. In answer to questions at a news conference, Mr. Jordan said that while “there appears to be an indifference” on the part of the Nixon Administration to blacks, he hoped as lawyer to carry his case to Washington “and not only be heard, but get results.” In a conference room of the Time‐Life Building, where his selection by the board of the National Urban League was announced, he explained that he did not come “with plans in my pockets” and that he would let others judge by his actions whether he was “radical, moderate or conservative.” Mr. Jordan, a tall, broadshouldered man, stressed the seriousness of the country's racial problems in a statement shortly after his selection was announced by James A. Linen, president of the league and chairman of the executive committee of Time Inc. He said: “At a time when there is an ominous and potentially explosive rise in unemployment in our Northern and Southern ghettos, the blacks, other minorities and the poor see increasing signs of indifference to their plight, the men and women of the Urban League are once again challenged to respond with the kind of pragmatic and creative programs for change which the nation has come to expect from this organization.” Praise for Young Asked how his program might differ from that of Mr. Young, who died while swimming in Lagos, Nigeria, last March 11, he replied with strong praise for his predecessor and the statement that “my approach will be my approach; whether that will be interpreted as radical, moderate or conservative will not be for me to judge.” When it was suggested that tension between blacks and whites had increased, Mr. Jordan said: “Dialogue and conversation must continue if we are to have understanding on both sides.” In announcing his acceptance of the post—he was named by the Urban League's board yesterday—he said: “I accept not because of the honor of succeeding a great man, but out of a deep sense of duty and responsibility to use whatever talents and abilities I have to help black people in America achieve their rightful and just place in this society and to help white America to understand that democracy, justice and equality are not reserved for ‘white folk only,’ but must be shared by all people without regard to race, religion, sex or national origin.” Mr. Jordan said he would not assume his new job until about the end of the year because he wanted to fulfill his commitment to lead a campaign for $10‐million for the United Negro College Fund, which helps support 36 black colleges that have 40,000 students. Until then, he said, Harold R. Sims, deputy director of the Urban League, will continue as acting director. The care with which Mr. Jordan threaded his way amid pointed questions, recalled to some observers the comments made about him by those who know him in his native Atlanta: “He's a young man with an old head.” DePauw Graduate Mr. Jordan, who was born Aug. 15, 1935, went through high school in Atlanta, then was graduated from DePauw University, in Greencastle, Ind., and the Howard University School of Law. He attained nationwide attention in 1961 when he led Charlayne Hunter into the University of Georgia through a mob of white protesters. It was a landmark in the drive for integration of Southern Schools. In his rise as civil rights leader, he has been field director in Georgia for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and director of the Voter Education Project for the Southern Regional Council. He has held fellowships at Harvard's Institute of Politics. the John F. Kennedy School of Government and the Metropolitan Applied Research Center. Mr. Jordan is married to the former Shirley M. Yarbrough. They have one daughter.

1324-> Albert Bids Democrats Lead a Drive to End Slump
WASHINGTON, April 8—House Speaker Carl Albert said today that there was no evidence that the recession was ending, and that the House Democratic leadership, there fore, must initiate legislation to deal with it. At a news conference that he called to discuss the state of the economy, he challenged President Nixon to veto the bills the Democrats will try to pass—and then to explain those vetoes to the voters in 1972. If Mr. Nixon vetoes the bills —which would, among other things, provide for a higher minimum wage and for Federal financing of jobs for the unemployed—“he will be giving himself a political liability that will be hard to deal with,” the Oklahoma Democrat said. Although the first antirecession measures that the Democrats will push will Involve proposals for additional Government spending, Mr. Albert said that tax reduction was also being considered. The tax cut the Democrats are considering would take the form of putting into effect this year the scheduled increase in the personal exemption from the present $650 to $750. Under existing law, the exemption would rise to $700 in 1972 and $750 in 1973. Mr. Albert said that the Democrats in the House must “accept the responsibility of providing the national leadership so urgently needed to end our prolonged economic slump” because, he said, the Nixon Administration is following “donothing” policies. “All of the economic indicators now available suggest that we are still in the throes of the 1970 recession,” he said. “While the art of the optimistic forecast has been developed to new levels of ingenuity, a look behind the rhetwin discloses that our economy is continuing to set new records all of theta bad find nowhere in the statistics any prospect for recovery, much less the boom predicted by the Administration. “An economy operating at an annual rate of $70‐billion below capacity, as ours was in the fourth quarter of 1970, needs priming badly, and Government is the logical source.” The antirecession programs that Mr. Albert cited included the following: ¶An emergency bill to put $2‐billion in accelerated public works projects in areas suffering from especially high rates of unemployment. This has been scheduled for a vote in the House right after the Easter recess. ¶A separate bill, which has already passed the Senate, providing $1.75‐billion in Federal funds to state and local governments to enable them to hire additional policemen firemen, and other public service employes. ¶Legislation to increase the minimum wage, now $1.60 an hour, to $2. ¶Legislation extending for two years the President's authority to establish wage and price controls. Authority for such a direct attack on inflation is needed, Mr. Albert said, because the Nixon Administration's policy of “slowing down the economy for the purpose of controlling inflation … hasn't worked. Inflation has gone on, and unemployment has increased.”

1325-> Giants’ Woe: Passive Resistance
The Giants aren't pushing the panic button, but they aren't pushing anything else either—opposing players, for example —and that's their trouble cuts in mind, Webster wants to get a better look at many of the newcomers. Alex Webster, who has re mained publicly calm through out his team's perfect exhibi tion record—three games, three defeats—viewed films of the Giants loss to the;lets yester day and noticed the same thing he did when the fiasco actually occurred Sunday. “We just weren't hitting peo ple,” Webster said. “We caught more blocks than we delivered. It's a question of getting more work. We haven't scrimmaged much this year. We haven't had that much contact. “We've spent an awful lot of time putting in our blocking rules and things like that. We're going to find out whether the players have been thinking too much about what they're sup posed to do instead of just go ing out and hitting.” Fred Dryer isn't sure what the players have or haven't been doing, but he knows what ne's not going to do. “I'm not going to push the panic button and say we're done for the season,” said Dryer, one of the defensive leaders. “We'll just have to come hack and practice hard and put it together for Phila delphia. The worst thing would be for the players and coaches to choke. That was the big thing last season. We didn't choke. We lost the first three games, but we stayed with it.” Because the Giants next play on Saturday, against Philadel phia at Princeton, N. J., Web ster will have one less day this week to work on eliminating some of the deficiencies. Besides increasing the fero Icity of the blocking and the tackling, the coach wanted to improve the team's timing. “We have to work on cadence more, on netting off the ball,” he said. “We've got to run through drills that will make us quicker.” During this week, Webster and his coaching staff must also study their personnel and de Icide which players will go by next Monday, the day National ‘Football League rosters have to he reduced to 49. With those “I'll shuffle people in and out,” he said, mentioning such players as Wayne Walton, tackle; Vernon Vanoy and Wil lie Townes, defensive linemen; Coleman Zeno, a wide receiver; Charlie Evans, a running back, and a quartet of linebackers, Jim Kates, Bob English, Jim Tyler and Ron Hornsby. Webster would also like to vee Joe Taffoni, an offensive lineman who walked out of camp, but has yet to walk back in. Webster said the Giants have been in touch with Taf ford, but he doesn't know what will happen. As for the four Giants who suffered injuries in the Jet game, none appeared to have any serious after‐effects. Ron Johnson aggravated pulled side muscle and didn't play as much as Webster would have liked, but he's expected to be ready to go against the Eagles. In fact, if last Sunday's game had been a regular‐season contest, the team's No. 1 run ner very likely would have played past the first quarter.

1326-> The Child Is at the Center of Informal British Schools
LONDON—Caren Cockrane, a shy 5‐year‐old, leaned over a scale and patiently weighed stones, corks, dog biscuits and pine cones as she struggled, with the help of her teacher, to understand why a single large stone can be heavier than four smaller ones. Other pupils at the Baus field Infants School in the middle‐class section of Ken sington—it is one of many “informal” schools that are radically changing the char acter of primary education in Britain—chatted and moved about while toying with mag nets and lights, poring over books and composing sen tences. At the Holmescarr Junior School in Rossington, every corner is brightened by daffo dils, and the airy, lively building contrasts vividly with the grayness of the Yorkshire coal‐mining village. The pupils charted the popu larity of dogs, made clay and wood models, sprawled on the floor of a carpeted room to read, tended doves and wrote stories about the lo custs they keep in a glass container. All the activities at the two schools reflect the accepted rhythm of the informal, “child‐centered” approach to education, which has steadily spread in this country in the last decade. More than a third of the 22,000 infant and junior schools, for children 5 to 12 years old, have been transformed by the approach, leaving behind the era of or derly, uniform classroonis. Another third are moving in the same direction. Among Americans seeking to improve elementary schools, great enthusiasm has been aroused by the diverse techniques of informal edu cation, which owes much to the views of Jean Paiget, John Dewey and Maria Mon tessori but is largely an un coordinated movement that has arisen in reaction to the rigidity and conformity of many schools in Britain. The approach, elements of which can be found on a scat tered basis even in traditional American schools, was re cently advocated by Ewald B. Nyquist, New York State Commissioner of Education, and Dr. Harvey B. Scribner, Chancellor of the New York City school system. Variations on the British efforts are being tried in American schools from North Dakota to Washington, D.C., to Harlem. Charles E. Silber man, author of “Crisis in the Classroom,” a new founda tion‐sponsored study of American schools, recom mend the approach as an antidote to “grim” and “joy classes. In Britain, debate over the effectiveness of informal edu cation is hampered by a lack of up‐to‐date, objective evi dence, such as standardized scores on reading tests, and is complicated by deep rifts over what the goals of schooling should be. Critics of informal school ing, educators and parents among them, have attacked both the theory and the prac tice of informal education. Asserting that informal edu cation has gone too far and has reduced literacy, they say it is failing to equip children with basic skills and “facts” and lessening their qualifica tions for jobs and their ability to pass academically oriented examinations that determine college admission. Adherents view the change as a great breakthrough that has proved its worth even if it still has far to go. “If you want children to leave schools as thrilled as when they came, this is the way to do it,” said Mollie Brearley, a leading authority on informal schooling, who re cently retired as principal of the Froebel Institute College of Education here. The basis for informal educa tion are several related ideas: First, children are their own chief agents of learning and individual pupils of the same age are at different learn ing stages. Second, each child, freed from any sense of failure, must be encouraged to dis cover his own powers and potential through challenging activities that interest him. Third, how the child learns —and that he learns—is more important than any “facts or body of knowledge” he ab sorbs. Educators have used these ideas to revamp schools with children of all backgrounds— from industrial Yorkshire and rural Oxfordshire to the slums of London's East End and comfortable Kensington. “It seems like another cen tury,” said Mrs. Sheila Kemp, recalling what Bausfield was like when she began teach ing there in 1959. “Each child has his place and spent most of the day sitting down and we teachers had our blackboards,” she added. “Now the whole phys ical thing has changed so much and there's much more opportunity for kids to blos som. But it didn't come over night and can't.” Informal education, while not allowing the free rein that typified American pro gressive schools 30 or 40 years ago, has given children much broader choices in what to do and when and whether to do it alone or with others. Classes and schools have been enriched with familiar and unusual materials, both home‐made and commercial, put within easy reach of the child and his imagination. Books of all kinds abound, nestled at times between old tires and bottletops, printing machines and sand mounds, stoves, tuned bells and guinea pigs, and devices for teach ing number relationships. The rows of desks are gone from many classes and the children are encouraged to explore their room and their school and to engage in conversation. Corridors are frequently the scene of as much painting and writing and play as the rooms, and the pupils' work is displayed everywhere. The teacher has been loosened up too. The syllabus has been shelved and the role shifted from instructor of whole classes to mobile catalyst, questioner, and con sultant to individuals and groups. “Children are in constant flux,” explained Geoffrey Pryce, a 31‐year‐old teacher at Holmescarr, in Rossington. “As teacher you keep taking the temperature, like a doc tor, and you feel a time for something, for deepening the child's experience.” The jobs of the poorly edu cated Yorkshire miners are destined to disappear in the next decade as more pits close down. The bulk of Holmescarr's 500 pupils, who are 7 to 11 years old, will be the first in their families to stay in school beyond the required age of 16, and few will go into the mines. “These are working‐class kids and we're not trying to make them middle class,” said Ted Tattersall, the head master. “They're certainly loved, but they've had a poor start in life, with little culture and not much talk. We want to enlarge them.” Whether in Rossington or Kensington, informal educa tion stresses concepts; un derstanding numbers is deemed more valuable than memorizing tables. Many methods of helping children learn to read are used in the informal schools, but virtual ly all attempt to reduce the distinction between the spoken word, the written word and the printed word. Pupils are armed with writ ing books when they enter the infant schools, for chil dren 5 to 7, and in informal schools the prodigious re sults are judged more on the basis of content than on punc tuation, spelling or grammar. Moreover, they are urged to illustrate what they write as a further means of ex pression. Edmund Pollinger, age 6, offered a combination at Bausfield the other day: look at “If a child does his best, that is acceptable,” said Mrs. Moira McKenzie, headmis trees at Bausfield. “You can't set the same goals for all of them. What's important is what you do today in rela tion Ito what you did yester day.” Another quality that is characteristic of informal education, but not limited to it, is openness and accessi bility. Without hesitating, Richard Tracy, a 5‐year‐old, walked into Mrs. McKenzie's office and announced that he was making a survey of hands. He asked her to place hers on a sheet of paper and he traced its outline. The headmistress asked whether her hand was bigger than his. He nodded affirma tively and she asked why. “Because you've got a bigger hand,” Richard replied. As he left he called back: “I may see you tomorrow.” In both Britain and the United States educational leaders stress the need for great care in adapting tradi tional schools to the informal approach. They do not regard it as a panacea, for educa tional ills but they say it is helping children learn how to think, value initiative, take responsibility for their actions and prize high stand ards. “Once you've got that,” said Lady Plowden, who led an extensive study of pri mary schools for the British Government, “you can add all the facts you want.”

1327-> Los Angeles, Now the ‘In’ Art Scene
LOS ANGELES—So far as the American art scene is concerned, Los Angeles is now more or less established as the country's most impor tant “second city.” San Fran cisco may be a pleasanter place to live, Chicago may have a better museum, and Cambridge, Mass., may boast more stringent critical minds, but Los Angeles is where the artists are—especially young artists. Though still a long way from seriously rivaling New York as the intellectual and financial nerve‐center of the American (and much of the international) art world, Los Angeles is nonetheless a place where new art is produced in great abundance—a city with an artistic culture of its own. The esthetics of the new art movements combined with the ethos of the youth movement have created an open, easy‐going, highly re ceptive atmosphere that is sympathetic to whatever is far‐out and untried, and young artists from the country over, as well as from abroad, have flocked here in increasing numbers. And in their wake have come—mostly as vis itors, however—more and more art dealers, collectors, museum curators, and art journalists whose special province is the latest thing. • These visitors often find, however, that it is more use ful to go to artists' studios than to count on seeing their work in public exhibitions. With the exception of a very few galleries and some of the small university museums in the area, there seems to be little effort to mount serious exhibitions of the new art. Thus, in a statement intro ducing the current show of “24 Young Los Angeles Art ists” at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, there is a passing reference to the “much discussed lack of fre quent exposure” of the new art, an oblique acknowledge ment, perhaps, that this par ticular museum, being the largest of its kind on the West Coast, has been a spe cial target of criticism in this respect. In organizing the current show, the museum's senior curator of modern art, Mau rice Tuchman, and his asso ciate curator, Jane Living ston, have selected the work of artists in their twenties and early thirties who, with very few exceptions, are still unknown outside local art circles. Though the exhibition actually includes a few paint ings, drawings and free‐stand ing sculptures, the main em phasis lies elsewhere—either on mixed‐media styles that require a kind of theatrical tableau for their realization or on abstract imagery of the most stringent starkness and purity. These have indeed been the esthetic polarities that have characterized the new art of the area during the last dec ade, and most of the artists in the current show seem more concerned to develop the ideas of their immediate predecessors than to break new ground for themselves. Still, the effect is not of anything second‐hand —not, anyway, in the majority of cases—but of a generation of artists entirely at home in the new styles, working with a certain ease and familiarity in exploring the implications of ideas they find especially congenial. On the one hand, these ideas point to a rampant in formality. Thus, in the larg est work in the show, called “Wall Piece,” John White has created on the walls of the museum a huge gallery‐size collage ‐ construction of pa per, straw, masking tape and other materials that is differ ent from a hundred other col lages of its type only insofar as it does not exist as a dis crete object. It is a temporary tableau that will be destroyed when the show is taken down. • On the other hand, these ideas are also concerned with a critical purity of image. Thus, Mary Corse's large white‐on‐white glass paint ings, with their subliminal rainbow effects, transfer to the painted surface some of the esthetic notions already familiar to us in the glass sculpture of Larry Bell and in the mixed‐media works of Robert Irwin, two of the most influential artists on the Los Angeles scene. Mr. Irwin's influence can also be seen in Barbara Munger's wall‐size thread construction, another essay on white ‐ on ‐ whiteeffects. Between these extremes, there are works employing electric light, paintings on felt, paintings on the wall of the gallery, and one construc tion of rope sacks containing grass sod and Crisco—yes, Crisco—that should (and is no doubt intended to) leave an indelible mark on the car pet of the gallery, if not on our sensibilities. Oddly enough, the most surprising discovery in the show is the most modest. Two small, very poetic and painstaking drawings of sea surfaces by Vija Celmins in a highly realistic style have an effect, in this context, out of all proportion to their size. Miss Celmins's work is certainly going to be of great interest to connoisseurs of drawing who are otherwise not going to find much to their taste here. Indeed, her presence in the “24 Young Los Angeles Artists” show leaves one wondering what other surprises of this kind the busy art scene may be harboring.

1328-> Market Place: Analysts Revise I.B.M. Forecast
International Business Ma chines absorbed a 13‐point thrashing Tuesday in heavy trading and then skidded more points yesterday as Wall Street emerged from its shock over the huge com puter company's cheerless second‐quarter financial re port. The nation's premier growth company, whose shares are the most popular of all among institutional in vestors, committed the virtu ally unpardonable by dis closing that it had experi enced very little growth at all in the period. Net income was pegged at $255.1‐million, up a mere $3‐million from $252.1‐mil lion in the 1970 quarter. What's more, T. Vincent Learson, chairman, held out little hole for improvement during tie rest of the year. “While our substantial un filled order backlog gives us confidence for the long term,” he asserted, “a con tinuation of current economic trends is likely to result in somewhat less favorable comparisons for future 1971 reporting periods.” The handwriting is on the wall, as far as many analysts are concerned. Some say the financial community had bet ter prepare itself for less than spectacular results from I.B.M. in the future. Earnings estimates were being revised downward yes terday at various investment firms. For some, it was the second downward revision this year on I.B.M. Whereas $10.50 a share was a fairly common estimate for 1971 only six months ago, $9.25 appears to be closer to the consensus today. Some firms are even ven turing to forecast a sub‐$9 year, which would mean 12 months of little or no growth for a company that has been the darling of Wall Street. Last year I.B.M. earned $8.92 a share. Analysts cite two major negative trends: declining sales of computers (as op posed to rentals) and declin ing prices. The increases recorded for rentals and serv ice, moreover, have been de clining quarter by quarter. Rentals tend to have cumulative impact on future earnings, while sales affect current earnings. This means that, even though sales ac count for only 27 per cent of revenues, their effect on cur rent operating results is greater. I.B.M. has been among the: most active issues on the fig Board for two days now. Yes terday it touched a 1971 low of 295 before rebounding to close at 300. The tivo‐day loss was 15 points. The consensus among ana lysts seems to be that the stock still has good long range potential but that it may be weaker in the short run. A few are talking about downside support in the 285 area. Here is a list of current 1971 earnings estimates for I.B.M. by major investment firms, compared with their earlier estimates: For a while yesterday big news seemed to be brewing in Atlas Corporation, a low‐ priced mining stock on the Big Board. At 12:14 the ex change halted trading in the issue, pending the release of information from the com pany. This is standard procedure to give investors time to evaluate important develop ments. Trading is always halted, for example, when stock splits or mergers are disclosed during market Hours. Shortly afterward, Edward R. Farley Jr., chairman of Atlas, indicated he would be glad to learn what the halt was all about—he didn't have anything to announce. While puzzled investors were wondering, the Big Board sheepishly acknowl edged a goof. Trading should have been halted in Atlas Chemical In dustries, which did have some news to disseminate. This company announced its earnings and said its planned acquisition by Im perial Chemical Industries would be completed by next Wednesday. Atlas Chemical's news in spired some investor enthu siasm. The stock finished the day with a gain of 1⅝ at 39½. Just plain Atlas ignored all the attention. It closed unchanged at 3⅛

1330-> State Mayors Shocked by Public Job Actions Here
Many of the Mayors of the state's 62 cities attending convention here said yesterday that they were “shocked” and “aghast” by the actions of rebellious New York City employes. Although not faced at the moment with pension disputes with employes in their cities, the Mayors voiced complete sympathy for Mayor Lindsay and the people here. The contention that upstaters have no feelings for New York City residents was disputed by Mayor Paul Lattimore of Auburn, who said: “The Mayors and the people throughout the state all have concern with the well‐being of the City of New York because it is an essential part of the state.” The Mayors and heads of 350 villages in the state are attend ing the State Conference of Mayors and Other Municipal Officials at the Americana. The conference, which started Mon day, will end tomorrow. Regarding municipal pension plans, Mayor Lattimore said it was time for union leaders to realize that “there is a point of no return in government the same as in private enterprise.” Mayor Lattimore, who has been nominated by both the Democrats and Republicans for another four‐year term, also heads an insurance brokerage concern. He said that despite his out side business, his job as Mayor was not part‐time. He pointed to the continuing “crisis” of the rebellion of prisoners in the state prison in Auburn. He spoke of Auburn policemen and firemen picketing City Hall there for nine months during contract negotiations that have finally been settled. “My philosophy of govern ment,” he said, “is the same as Al Smith's, who said, The best politics is good government.” Mayor Robert J. Cronin of Glens Falls said he was “aghast” at the enormousness of this city's problems and “dis tressed at the kind of action that strikes out at people, in nocent people.” Mayor Cronin, who is also professor of government and history at the College of St. Rose in Albany, said he did not understand the union's at tack on Mayor Lindsay and citizens here because of the Mayor's liberal approach to unions. He said that Mayor Lindsay had the hardest single political job in the country because, un like President Nixon, “he has the responsibilities but no power.” Mayor Cronin said he thought that the proposal to create a state out of the metro politan New York area made sense. Mrs. Virginia B. McDonald, the only woman Mayor of a city in this state, said she was “surprised and shocked” by Monday's events, and she ex pressed deep sympathy for the people affected and for both Mayor Lindsay and Governor Rockefeller. Mayor McDonald of Cohoes, a city of 18,600 people a short distance from Albany, talked of her own problems. She said their city had adopted a $3‐ million budget for 1971–72 on the basis of $725,000 in state aid. With state aid knocked out, she faces a deficit of $103, 000, which she is trying to over come by cutting back depart 1ment requests by 5 per cent. In the principal address yes terday before the Mayors, a Department of Housing and Ur ban Development official said that if President Nixon's reve nue‐sharing bill died in the House Ways and Means Com mittee, a similar bill would be introduced directly on the floor of the House this summer. Floyd H. Hyde, the depart ment's newly appointed assist ant secretary for community development, said the Nixon plan had broad‐based support among Congressmen, but noted that it was opposed by Wilbur Mills, chairman of the House committee. Under the Nixon proposal, municipalities in New York State would receive $534‐mil lion of the $5‐billion that would be made available to local gov ernments.

1331-> Thousands of Newark Students Are Playing Hooky
NEWARK, April 8—Tens of thousands of this city's public school students have been playing hooky with impunity since the teachers union strike began 10 weeks ago. The Board of Education estimated today that only 53 to 54 per cent of the 80,000 students have been attending classes during the strike and that 68 per cent of their teachers were with them. The teachers union contends, generally, that absenteeism by both students and teachers, is considerably higher than this. Whatever the attendance, however, the police say that from January to February, the first month of the strike, there was a 15 per cent increase in acts of juvenile delinquency. As the spring grows warmer, the police expect the rate of youthful mischief and crime to increase further. “I just sign in in the morning, that's all,” said 14‐year‐old Michael Dixon as he explained why he was brushing up his jumpshot abilities rather than his algebra at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. As he tossed the basketball through the hoop in the yard of the Quittman Street Elementary School, he explained that “no one” had to attend classes at his school, Central High, once they had signed an attendance register in the morning. Michael said that the first few weeks of the strike were a welcome vacation, but that now he was bored and eager to get back to school. On Summit Avenue, overlooking the downtown section, stands the granite Central High School. In normal times it is a busy place with close to 2,000 students. At 2 P.M. today, the place looked more like a public library in the county seat of some sparsely populated region. In one classroom, six sturents sat reading at their seats. In another, four girls listened to an Ike and Tina Turner record playing quietly on a phonograph. “These people are all seniors,” explained Bobby Roberts, a 17‐year‐old who himself expects to graduate this June. “Most everybody else signs in and then leaves in the morning.” The student said that he has been coming every day and that he has been lucky on two counts. One, he has already been accepted by Delaware State College, and, two, all the teachers of his major subjects have been coming in. “Stine of the other guys are in trouble, though,” he said “They haven't heard from their colleges, and they're not getting any preparation.” He said there were times last week when there were more youths hanging around Ralph and Lucy's luncheonette on Warren Street than were in the school. The luncheonette was closed today because of Holy Thursday. For scores of students, school hours today were a time for experiencing the dubious joys of downtown Newark. Some window‐shopped. Some, according to merchants and guards, contemplated shoplifting and some played “games of skill” at the amusement arcade at 189 Market Street. At about the time that two seventh‐graders named Ruth and Doris, who are students at the Seventh Avenue School, were scoring 1,308 points on the “Wild West” pinball machine, the owner of Children's World, Stanley Chera, was saying that he had hired a Herkimer Protection Agency guard for $30‐a‐day because of shoplifting by students at his Market Street shop since the strike began. “We don't catch too many,” Mr. Chera said. “They take pair of socks or anything that's loose, and run.” As he spoke, three teen‐aged girls approached the shop entrance, looked at the uniformed woman guard and her billy club, then left. “They come in here in hordes,” said Robert E. Wilson, a special policeman on duty at the three‐level F. W. Woolworth's store at Broad and Market Streets. “They're not bad kids, a lot of them,” Mr. Wilson went on, “but all this free time, they're just bound to get in trouble.” The combination of the strike and the holiday season has made it doubly difficult for security men in the city's ilarger retail stores. “In these crowds, it's easy for a kid to grab something and get away,” one uniformed guard said, “besides, they know that as juveniles, nothing much will happen to them.” Mr. Wilson said he thought that about half of the children who steal were narcotics users, “even the S‐year‐olds.” “They'd be a lot better off in school,” he said. The strike has even affected members of the same family differently. For instance, 10‐year‐old Shelay McBride has had a succession of substitutes teaching her fourth‐grade class at the Quittman Street School, while her 8‐year‐old sister, Betty, has had her regular teacher. “We haven't done or learned anything,” said Shelay. “Half the class is absent and the teacher we have now just gives us 40 pieces of paper with 10 problems on each piece and tells us to do them.” “Our class is just like it always was,” said her sister. “Everything's fine.”

1332-> Saints Upset Cowboys, 24 to 14
While indecision remains as to whether Craig Morton or Roger Staubach is to be the Cowboys’ starting quarterback, Archie Manning, the rookie sig nal‐caller for the Saints, en hanced the chances for his job by forging a 24‐14 upset vic tory over Dallas at New Or leans yesterday. Manning passed for one touchdown and ran for two to do his part in giving the Saints their first victory ever over the National Football League's de fending National Conference champions. It was a futile uphill struggle for the visitors all the way. The Saints took’ the lead in the opening period on Manning's 29‐yard aerial to Tony Baker. They led, 17.0 at the half, and spent the rest of the after noon looking over their shoul ders at the Cowboys. A swarming Saint defense harassed Morton in the first half. For a time it appeared that Staubach, who entered the scene after the intermission, might rally his team. The former Navy scrambler threw 41‐yard and 16‐yard touchdown passes to narrow the gap to 17‐14. But Dallas lost its momentum halfway through the final period when Charlie Waters fumbled and lost a punt. Manning eventually ran 3 yards to give the home team its final score. 49ERS 13, BEARS 0 A circus catch between two defenders by Gene Washington and a pair of short field goals by Bruce Gossett were the chief ingredients in San Fran cisco's first shutout in 10 years. Gossett got his licks in first, with 9 and 15 yard boots, that gave the 49ers a 6.0 lead. Then Washington grabbed a 12‐yard aerial from John Brodie while Bob Jeter and Ronnie Smith were trying to intervene. VIKINGS 24, PACKERS 13 Green Bay gave Minnesota plenty of help. Two Packer fum bles were followed by touch down passes by Gary Cuozzo as the Vikings moved into a first place tie with Detroit in the Central Division. For Cuozza, it was a field day. The Minnesota quarterback was on the throw ing end of all three of his team's touchdowns. RAMS 24, FALCONS 18 Less than five minutes stood between Los Angeles and de feat when the Rams offense suddenly began percolating. With 4:50 to play, Roman Gabriel sneaked across from an inch out to provide the winning margin. Then Willie Ellison added another touchdown with a slashing 5‐yard run as the gun sounded. The Rams led, 10.6, at the half, but the Fal cons, who have never beaten the Coast team in 12 games, went ahead on the final peri od's first play when Jack Mal lory scooped up a fumble by Ellison and sprinted 54 yards. The largest crowd‐60,284‐ to see a Cincinnati sports event turned out to cheer for the Bengals and the home team gave its rooters plenty of early cause to whoop it up. The high point was in the third quarter, when Essex Johnson, running as though chased by a posse, raced 49 yards from scrimmage for what appeared to be Cin cinnati's clinching touchdown. During his sprint, Bengals speedster spun away from five would‐be tacklers to make the score 24‐13. But later Cincin nati's rookie quarterback, Ken Anderson, fumbled on his 10. Jack Gregory recovered for the Browns and they needed only two plays to score. The payoff came on a 7‐yard pass from Bill Nelsen to Bo Scott. Scott rushed 4 yards for the winning touchdown with 30 seconds re maining in the game. Denver skies turned black and sporadic rain fell after San Diego narrowed the Broncos's half‐time lead of 20‐6 to 20‐16 in the final quarter. But while it remained dark overhead, the picture cleared for the Broncos when San Diego's Chris Fltcher lost a fumble to Jack Gehrke on the Charger 9. Denver was unable to score in four running plays, but the miscue cost the Chargers as the clock ran out before they could regain pos session. For Denver, the victory was a notable one. It marked its first success of the cam paign. Bob Griese threw four touch down passes in the first half, with Paul Warfield and How ard Twilley on the receiving end twice apiece. In contrast to Griese's sharpshooting, Jim Plunkett, the Patriots’ passer, found himself plowed under just before each of Miami's first four scoring marches. The 1970 Heisman Trophy winner was thrown for an 11‐yard loss to end New England's first of fensive series. Miami thereupon drove 66 yards to score on 22‐yard flip from Griese to Twilley. It was curtains for the Patriots after that, as they registered a total offense of only 117 yards. LIONS 31, OILERS 7 Houston is still seeking its first league victory after a fruitless clash with Detroit. Steve Owens, who was the league's No. 1 rusher as the day started, thrived for the Lions, although he played with a shoulder and hamstring in jury. Lem Barney notched his 33d career interception and put Detroit in the scoring col umn at the start of the second period. Then Owens scored with a 10‐yard dash and De troit was on its way to its one‐sided victory. Oakland had Daryle Lamoni ca sitting out the first half and it just didn't work out. Phila delphia led, 10.0, at the half and 10‐6 late in the third period when Lamonica began pulling switches. When the dust cleared, there were the Raiders with three quick touchdowns and a 27‐10 advantage. A rec ord Oakland Coliseum crowd of 54,614 watched Lamonica connect on seven of 15 passes for 133 yards. Fred Biletnikoff proved as sure‐fingered as us ual snaring eight aerials worth 148 yards.

1333-> Theater: Coast Transvestite Troupe
The Cockettes were in town, and for days the air had been filled with flackery, trumpeting the cause of this transvestite troupe “direct” from San Francisco, On Sunday night the old Anderson Theder looked like a drag ball. All closets were open for the opening of “Tinsel Tarts in a Hot Coma.” There were subterranean Celebrities (and some aboveground stars as well) with faces dipped in silver, swinging boas and sporting plumage, foliage and décolletage. There were pale‐faced Rudolph Valentinos, blackcreped Garbos Captain Americas; and a man done up as Queen Elizabeth T. After, hour of of “audience,” it was past time for the second part of the show. The entertainment shifted from the orchestra to the stage for “Sylvester and His Het Band.” Fleshing a grin, batting his mascara‐ed eyes, Mr. Sylvester, a tall black man in hot pants, wailed and shouted rock and soul like an Aretha touched with Sumac. He was backed by a gospel trio and an electrified combo. He was on too long, but he held his audience. Tension continued to mount as the time of the Cockettes approached. Following a dedication of the show to Truman Capote, One of the group's advance admirers, “Tinsel Tarts” began. With all the pre‐premiere hysteria it was difficult for the Cockettes to live up to their reputation. The surprise was that in minutes they completely lived down their reputation. This is a drag Show to end all drag shows, the kind of exhibition that murders camp and gives transvestism a bad name. A tacky melange of quasiparodies of Hollywood mayies, “Tinsel Tarts,” fixes for a time on a fugitive star, Madge the Magnificent (John Rothermel giving the single creditable performance). Unburdened by imagination, the musical pays dig‐homage to the Marx Brothers, Carmen Miranda, Busby Berkeley and others, all of whom don't deserve it. The few amusing seconds were accidental—two tinny angels colliding with a plink, performers catching microphone cords in their gowns.

1334-> One Park Has Business as Usual‐‐‐No Maintenance
The strike carne quietly yesterday to Owl's Head Park in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn—so quietly that nobody noticed it. The usual nothing was be ing done to maintain the place, according to regular users. The lawn was not be ing trimmed as usual, the refuse was not being picked up, the benches were not being repaired, the broken fences were not being mended. The difference yesterday was that, with park workers joining the strike action, there was suddenly a reason for the park's chronic con dition of neglect. The park, which rises steeply from Colonial Road and 67th Street to a summit that commands a fine view of the harbor and Manhat tan, was studded with beer and soda cans. Their tops blazed back the fire of the sun. Six women and 14 children were gathered in a circle un der the shade of a tree. “The men do very little here,” Mrs. Julie Dunleavy said in her Scottish burr. “Have a look at the benches.” She nodded toward a line of concrete bench posts—one was broken off at the top—in a long row. There were two seat slats running the length of the 10½ posts, but no back slats. “See that slide there,” Mrs. Dunleavy said. “It took a year to fix it. All there was was stairs, no slide.” All six women proved to be from Scotland. “We came here for the better life,” one of them said, with a touch of sarcasm. “We pick up our own mess when we go away,” Mrs. Eliz abeth Campbell said. “The workers? We didn't even miss them.” • Just across Shore Parkway, the Owl's Head Pollution Control Plant was being picketed, inanimately, by two signs tied to the top of a fire hydrant. A few feet away, in the shade, four striking sewage treatment workers were avoiding sunburn as well as picket duty and were also neglecting the combined sew age output of “Bay Ridge, part of South Brooklyn, part of Bensonhurst, Borough Park and probably Bath Beach— about 100 million gallons,” as one of them put it. They were standing across from the old Staten Island Ferry pier, about 30 feet from a point where the green water was lapping the sludge‐brown rocks. They had closed the “huge influent gates” in the plant, diverting the sewage to tide gates that spill it all out into the water. “Come around sometime when we're working,” one of them said. “When it rains, the sanitary system and the storm sewers are all inter connected and everything flows into our system from the sewers — rags, planks, rats —millions of rats — old tires, timbers. We'll show you how we go down into the tanks.” • Signs marked “Queens,” “Brooklyn,” “Manhattan” and “Bronx” were set in the four colonial windows on the first floor of the six‐story Muni cipal Employes Union Center at 365 Broadway and Frank lin Street. There was no fifth window, so the “Richmond” sign was stuck on the marble pillar of the fabrics store next store. Pickets from the five boroughs had mustered under the signs at 6 A.M. to be loaded on buses and driven to their strike assignments. At 1 P.M. a black station wagon drew up, bearing luncheon rations for the masterminds of municipal nonfeasance. Nine cardboard cartons stuffed with corned beef, roast beef and other sandwiches from Katz's Deli catessen were borne in to re lieve famine at the command post. “They killed my business yesterday,” said IsidorTarow sky, the manager of Katz's, supervising the delivery. “But today they helped. Yesterday nobody came into the city— it took 11 hours for some people and they turned around and went home first.” “Where you going to do business — from the sky, from the wind?” he demand ed, warming to his theme. “Look you gotta have people.” “Business improved today,” Mr. Tarowsky said through his cigar, waving a check in the air. “These people, you see, they pay,” he said, grin ning. Three men stood in front of the building, talking about picketing or taking it easy. “What do'ya want to do, go around wearing a sign, day like this,” the loudest one said. His counsel seemed to prevail in the 90‐degree heat.

1335-> Rarely Heard ‘Herodiade’ Given at Concert in Park
The sweetly passionate Sa lome of Massenet's “Hérodi ade” is a far cry from the depraved sensualist in the opera Richard Strauss made from Oscar Wilde's play. Mas senet's Music is just as dis tant in quality and theatrical power from Strauss's, which probably explains why the French work is rarely per formed today, although it was once very popular. The sear ing, glittering Strauss score overwhelms, in memory's ear, any other treatment of the story of Salome, her love for John the Baptist and the lat ter's beheading at the instiga tion of the vengeful Herodias. Yet on its own terms “Hé rodiade” has its atractions, as was demonstrated in a concert performance of ex cerpts frorn the opera by the Naumburg Symphony Or chestra on Monday night in Central Park. The work pre cedes “Manon” in the canon of Massenet operas, but at its best recalls that master piece in its melodic grace and its shrewdly colorful orchestration. • Two of its arias are still well‐known, Salome's “Il est doux, it est bon,” and Herod's “Vision fugitive.” A third, John's “Adieu done, vaians ob jects,” deserves to be just as popular, and there are other scenes that are scarcely less appealing in their pretty, 19th‐ century French way. It was useful for the Naum burg Symphony to perform the “Fierodiade” excerpts, and it was valiant on the part of the five young singers who took part to learn roles they may never get to sing again. It was also tantalizing and frustrating, as it is in most outdoor concerts, not to get the full impact of the music because of inadequate am plification and extraneous noises. It was next to impos sible to understand anyone's French, except in the case of the tenor Kenneth Riegel, who sang John the Baptist. Mas senet's delicate scoring often disappeared in the night. Judged under such circum stances, Mr. Riegel's singing still had a fine intensity and finesse in phrasing. Karen Altman used her lovely so prano voice with exceptional expressivity as Salome. The range of Herodias's music strained. Joanna Simon's mez zo‐soprano at times. The same was true of James Farrar, baritone, as Herod, and Alan Ord, bass, as Manuel. They sang well enough, but needed more maturity and authority for their roles. Emerson Buckley, who con ducts much of the unfamiliar French operatic repertory around town, whenever it is done, kept the performance on an even keel, which is about all that could be ex pected.

1336-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: One of the reasons cited by Roger J. Herz (letter March 20) for increas ing the tolls collected on the East River crossings is “to discourage pas senger cars.” This is one of many recent ex amples of the city administration's anti‐automobile attitude. Instead of doing more to facilitate parking and to improve the flow of traffic (except by trying to eliminate it), they not only blame the automobile for many of the city's problems, ranging from air pollution (conceded to be partially true), through traffic congestion, to the fiscal woes of the M.T.A., but permit the charging of what any other community would recognize as out rageously high parking fees, tolerate the greatest auto theft rings in the world and use an archaic and mislead ing system of traffic information signs in addition to charging admission to Manhattan. What seems to be forgotten in all of this is that automobiles represent people who find it necessary to get from one place to another and despite the Obstacles find this the best, often the only, way of doing so. The M.T.A. and commuter railroads serve only limited locations. Taxis Could in prin ciple meet most needs served by auto mobiles but in practice often can not be obtained and openly refuse to go to certain locations, laws to the Contrary, notwithstanding. Anyone who doesn't believe this should try to see what often happens when, before get ting into a taxi at Kennedy Airport or even after getting in, he asks to go to the Jamaica station of the Long Island Railroad. The ills of both mass transit and surface traffic need cures, and both should be treated instead Of trying to cure the one by making the other worse. For mass transit to succeed, its availability, dependability and gen eral appeal need improving. For the traffic problem a great deal more could be done. In particular, all new con struction should be required to pro vide adequate off street parking for the automobiles of employes and cus tomers expected and for off‐street loading and unloading of trucks. It seems to me that the only legiti mate basis for collecting tolls at the river crossings is to pay for the cost of construction and maintenance of these or future facilities. The proposed increases are another method of harassing the motorist and should not be adopted. East Setauket, L. I., March 20, 1971

1337-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: The Times on May 24 ran a news story about an article in the New York Law Journal by William J. vanden Heuvel, Chairman of the city's Board of Corrections. In this article Mr. van den Heuvel advocated, among other things, that courts give up the tradi tional summer recess, and that judges not take more than four weeks of vacation. In the course of an interview with a reporter of The Times concerning the article, Mr. vanden Heuvel quoted me as saying at the 1967 New York State Constitutional Convention that “many senior Supreme Court and Civil Court judges” got lengthy vacations each year. In fact, my remarks concerned only Civil Court Justices, and went to some length to indicate that it was not the fault of the Civil Court or its hard working judges that some took long vacations, since there just was not enough work to be done in that court during the summer. I was speaking in support of a proposal to merge the Civil and Criminal Courts of the City of New York—and making the point that Civil Court judges and non‐judi ciary personnel could be more effi ciently utilized by such a merger. As to Mr. vanden Heuvel's proposal itself, I shall merely state that the criminal branches of the courts can not function unless the understaffed District Attorneys, Legal Aid and Pro bation Officers, among other agencies, are able to man the court parts. From my experience as former Pre siding Justice of the First Department, and I am certain it holds true today, I have no doubt at all that if there were enough cases presented to them, most judges would radically and willingly curtail the summer recess to aid in reducing the court backlogs. But first, the city must supply the above‐mentioned agencies with much greater manpower and other resources than they now enjoy, because judges cannot prepare, prosecute and defend the cases brought before them.

1338-> Like the Price of Cows, the Cost of a Bride Goes Up in Turkey
ANKARA—When Ali Ihsan married here five years ago, he paid his father in‐law 6,000 Turkish lira (the equivalent then of $500) in baslik, or bride price. Now Ali's 18‐year‐old sister is being courted by a fellow student whose fam ily has hinted that it considers 12,000 ($800 since last summer's devaluation) as a fair price. Ali, a handsome 25‐year‐old who drives a taxi to earn money to resume his university studies, thinks the infla tion is understandable. “The price of everything has gone way up in Turkey since I got married,” he said, “and besides my sister is a city‐bred girl. My wife comes from a village.” For both his wife and his sister, Ali explained hurriedly, the concept of baslik is not the traditional one, a com pensation to the woman's father for pre serving her virginity until marriage and for losing her services in the home or on the farm. “The money I paid my father‐in‐law,” he said, “was spent on furniture for us.” In remote villages of eastern Turkey, however, the actual cash payment may still go into the pocket of the father of the bride. Professor Nermin Abadan, an Ankara University sociologist, still re members a visit she made to one such village in 1963. “One aga there, who actually owned seven hamlets, was marrying his daugh ter at the time, and the baslik was fixed according to her weight,” the professor recalled. “In a feudal structure like that, the woman becomes a commodity in trade, just like a cow or a sheep.” Once actually known as the “weight price,” baslik is an Islamic custom that the Turks did not export to Christian countries they once ruled. In Greece, for instance, the father or sponsor of the bride is obliged by the civil code to set tle a dowry on his marrying daughter. In Communist Yugoslavia a less ro mantic practice is required. Just before their civil wedding bride and groom must present inventories of the property each brings to the marriage, and the lists go into the nuptial contract to be used again in case of separation or di vorce. As Turkey becomes progressively more urban and its women better edu cated, the bride price, as a ritual, is diminishing in importance. A 1968 survey by Haciteppe University's Institute for Demographic Studies found that while nearly 80 per cent of the women mar ried in eastern Anatolia in the previous 25 years had been “sold” for a baslik, only 24 per cent of the women along the Aegean and Sea of Marmara coasts had undergone the practice. In the country's three largest cities, where over 4 million of Turkey's 36 mil lion people live, only 19 per cent of the women surveyed were married with the baslik, and only 7.4 per cent of women actually born in the cities. These three metropolises, Ankara, Istanbul and Iz mir, moreover, grew three times faster between 1965 and 1970 than the villages of 2,000 or fewer people where 60 per dent of all Turks still live. Attractive Serim Timur, a harried doc toral candidate, wife and mother, is col lating the survey's findings. She observed that the bride price “reinforces the fa ther's authority” in traditional societies, but added, “It is now seen only in places where women work hard and contribute to the economy” and where marriages are arranged by the families involved. “In cities in Turkey,” Mrs. Timur noted, “it's just the same custom as in other countries where families help to set up young households.” Of course, there are still places where, on the conclusion of the marriage con tract between the two families, the groom's representatives hand over cash in return for a small box that symbolizes the bride's virginity. “And it is certainly true that infla tion affects bride prices,” Mrs. Timur agreed. “One village, woman interviewed said her baslik had been 500 lira and that the going price now was 3,000. But when she was married, 500 lira was worth two cows, and I'm not sure you can get two cows for 3,000 lira these days.”

1339-> Campbell Ousted in British Amateur
CARNOUSTIE, Scotland, May 31 (AP) — Bill Campbell and 15 other Americans were elimi nated today in the first round of the British Amateur golf championship tournament. There were 36 other United States players still alive in the match play competition over Carnoustie's 6,828‐yard, par 36, 36‐72 course after an open ing day of fine weather. Forty eight more first‐round matches are on tap tomorrow. The sun beamed and there was hardly a breeze, but it didn't help Campbell. The 48‐ year‐old Walker Cup player from Huntington, W. Va., was beaten by 24‐year‐old Gino Russo, a third ‐ generation Italian Scot, 4 and 2. Russo is a lecturer at Glasgow Univer sity. Campbell, who lost the first four holes, was one of the 20 seeded players. Tom Kite Jr., a 21‐year‐old Walker Cup player from Aus tin, Tex., carded three birdies as he overwhelmed George Warren, a United States Army surgeon from Hampton, S. C., 7 and 6. Warren is serving in Heidelberg, Germany. Many of the Americans entered are servicemen based in Europe. Michael Bonallack, the Brit ish Walker Cup captain and winner of the championship the last three years, and the American stars, Steve Melnyk and Jim Simons, struggled to victories. Bonallack, 36, was taken to the 19th hole by 22‐year‐old Philip Colbey, an Englishman. Bonallack finished with a birdie as a 7‐iron shot landed about three feet from the hole and he sank the putt. Simons, of Butler, Pa., was 3 down with three holes to go against Ian Hutcheson, twice winner of the Carnoustie club championship. But the 21‐year‐old Simons took the next three holes to tie and won at the 20th. Melnyk, a former United States Amateur champion from Jacksonville, Fla., struggled to a 1‐up victory over Barry John ston of South Africa. In the twilight Jim Gabriel sen, 29, of Atlanta defeated David Ramsey of Scotland, 4 and 3. Earlier, Vinnie Giles of Rich mond eliminated Harry Easter ly of the same city, 4 and 3. The two work for the same investment company in Rich mond—and Easterly is Giles's boss. ??

1340-> Uneasy Riders
Disclosure by the Transit Authority of its growing deficits has the familiar ring of that softening process intended to prepare subway and bus riders for the next round of fare increases. A serious factor in the alarming rise in operating losses appears to be a steady decline— 6 per cent in five years—in the number of passengers who use the public transportation system. This then is obviously the golden moment to increase public transportation revenues by getting the lost cus tomers back to the subways or into the buses. The steep rise in taxi fares has resulted in an estimated 20 per cent drop in cab riders. Allowing for some desperate New Yorkers' rediscovery of the art of walk ing, there still remains a sizable number who, at least for the moment, have given up on taxis and are turning to public transport. The number of potential subway and bus riders might be increased even further by the proposed increase in bridge and tunnels tolls which may dissuade commuters from bringing their cars into the city. The question is whether management is sufficiently awake to keep its new patrons or, by exposing them to the indignities of nonservice, drive them back to taxis and cars. The prospects are not encouraging. Despite periodic self‐congratulatory statements and the arrival of some new equipment, the incidence of delays and breakdowns on the subways continues to infuriate millions of strap hangers, just as it has for years. The issue of the subways' physical safety may be debatable; their threat to emotional stability is beyond question. The performance of the buses is, if anything, even less satisfactory. Many coaches are so poorly main tained, in addition to being roach‐infested, that their state of disrepair creates actual discomfort. Inadequate visibility of route, numbers presents a particular incon venience in midtown where buses pick up passengers at alternate stops. Route maps, primitive and uninform ative even in their brief prime, have disappeired from many locations. And some drivers are as uncommunica tive as they used to be when the reason cited for their incivility was their preoccupation with making change. By far the most serious affront to pasengers, how ever, is the apparently unbreakable herd‐instinct of the metropolitan bus lines. Apart from the fact that the buses invariably get in each other's and everybody else's way, the parade of three or four, or more, buses together condemns would‐be passengers to interminable waiting‐periods once a caravan has passed. It is at such times, particularly in bad weather, that the resolve patronize public transportation most readily evaporates. Many of these failures could be avoided, without addi tional funds, through nothing more magic than good management and enforcement of proper operating rules. Unhappily, there is little indication that concern for passengers' comfort has improved in the wake of any of the periodic fare increases. Whatever other fiscal problems the Transit Authority may face, it cannot now shift the blame for want of passengers. Having been metered out of their cab rides, they are obviously available—ready and anxious to be carried, if only they could be assured of consideration and tolerable efficiency.

1342-> Buffalo's Draft Raiders Explain Their Motivation
“O.K. The war goes on. Viet namization is found to be an other lie.” In a long statement opening with those words, the five persons arrested for raid‐1 ing a Selective Service office in Buffalo over the weekend, explained their motives yester day. The statement, signed simply “The Buffalo,” was reportedly written by the group of three men and two women before their arrest Saturday. A similar statement was said to have been prepared by the group of 20 persons arrested early Sun day, in an apparently unrelated incident, in a similar raid on the Camden, N.J., draft office. The Buffalo statement, made public yesterday afternoon through an antiwar group in New York City, linked the con tinuing conflict in Vietnam with racism, pollution, “big busi ness’ ,brutal pursuit of profit,” and domestic “repression” of dissent. Success Anticipated The language, at points, in dicated that it was written in anticipation of success, perhaps meant to be left behind in the Selective Service and Army Intelligence offices where the militants were arrested by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who, the bu reau said, were “checking the security of the building.” “You see,” the statement said, “today we destroyed the records of the Selective Service System in Buffalo, local boards 82 through 89; in addition, we confiscated records of the office of military intelligence...” The raiders, the statement said, saw it as “our duty before God and man” to act against “these records that help make the Vietnam war possible.” The statement said the mili tants were seeking to uphold “the freedom not to kill on an other's command” but indicat ed continually throughout the statement that their protest was not against the war in Vietnam alone, which the statement, called “symptomatic of a deep sickness in this country.” The militants pointed out that in raiding the offices to “hinder the abduction of our sons and brothers,” they did not use “dynamite or fire” or offer violence to “the man on guard.” The significance of the signature was noted, too, in footnote that said the buffalo, “once a powerful beast of free dom” and once nearly elimi nated, was “returning today.” The similar Camden state ment, according to a source close to the defendants, was being revised before its re lease. A spokesman for the F.B.I. said the two statements had “not yet” been received at the bureau's Washington headquarters and he did not know if the bureau would re lease them. An F.B.I. spokesman in Phila delphia, which coordinated the efforts leading to the arrests there, said that the bureau was “not looking for anyone else right at this moment,” adding that it was always “possible” that others would be arrested. 21st Person Arrested Sources close to the investi gation said no further arrests were expected in the immediate future, although others might he named if indictments were handed up by a grand jury. In Camden yesterday, a 21st person, one of those named inll the 22‐page complaint, surren dered at the United States At torney's office. Dr. William Anderson, 36 years old, at whose home, ac cording to the complaint, the alleged conspirators met to plan their raid on the draft office, was charged with conspiring to remove and mutilate public rec ords, steal Government prop erty, destroy Government prop erty and commit a crime on Government reservation. He was not charged with taking part in these actions, as were the 20 arrested Sunday. Dr. Anderson, an osteopath was released in $10,000 bond after his arraignment before United States Magistrate Charles Rudd. Magistrate Rudd gave Dr Anderson permission to travel to Pennsylvania, but not to New York. “I don't want you to get in any trouble,” he said. “I don't want you going around making) any speeches. You people can organize, you can demonstrate, but in a proper manner.” Dr. Anderson, who was ques tioned by F.B.I. agents for more than an hour, refused to talk with newsmen. One of those arrested Sunday was freed on bail yesterday. Fie was Francis Mel Madden, a married priest, who lives in East Orange, N. J. On Sun day, another of the raiders, the Rev. Milo M. Billman, 39, a Lutheran Minister from Camden was freed on his own recogni zance. But the problem of raising bail for the others—the amount totaled more than $400,000—was a major preoccupation of friends and associates of the Camden group yesterday. Central to much of the ac tivity was the Rev. Joseph O'Rourke, a 33‐year‐old Jesuit and antiwar activist, who has shared his apartment—in the building at the corner of Broad way and 98th Street—with the Rev. Peter D. Fordi, 34, one of the two priests in the Cam den group. “We're trying to do some thing about bail,” Father O'Rourke told a caller—one of many—in his tiny apartment yesterday morning. And a few minutes later he told another. “I talked to Peter [Fordi] in jail—his spirits are high.” Father O'Rourke, who seems mildly uncomfortable when he is addressed as anything but Joe, was involved in an anti war action against the Dow Chemical Company in 1969. His apartment—a small bed room, a smaller kitchen and a bathroom — is one of several in the building that are occu pied by 62 Jesuits affiliated with the order's Woodstock Theological College. There are, Father O'Rourke said, about 150 members of the society in five buildings in the neighborhood, and by no means all of them are in entire sym pathy with “the conscience people” — as those who take part in disruptive, nonviolent civil disobedience are some times called. Berrigans’ Influence Strong The Rev. Daniel Berrigan and his brother, the Rev. Philip Berrigan, who are in prison for having destroyed draft records, are among the major in fluences on the thinking of such activists as Father O'Rourke and his friends in what is known as the Catholic left. So, too, are some Protestants and vowed nonbelievers, such as the late Albert Camus, the French philosopher, whose comfi ment “I would like to be able to love my country and still love justice” — was quoted in the Buffalo statement. The Camus statement is one of two decorations on the walls of Father O'Rourke's apart‐1 ment; the other is a carved dove of peace surmounted by the word “shalom.” One question frequently asked about actions such as those in Buffalo and Camden is what they accomplish. Accord ing to Father O'Rourke, they are more than symbolic; by now, he said, “well over one million” files have been de stroyed. He said that such destruction caused months of incon venience and disruption and, served a secondary purpose of drawing attention to the Selec tive Service System itself, which is now, he said, “under fire.” A spokesman for the sys tem in Washington said the one‐million figure was “hard to discount,” but he said it was “immaterial, because destroy ing cards doesn't accomplish anything.” “We've had duplicates of everything,” he said, “and the most that resulted from the destruction was a delay of A few days.” He said that there have been an average of “five or more” raids on draft offices each month so far this year, a con siderable drop from the 168 raids in 1970. During the fiscal year 1969‐70 he said, the cost of the raids to the Government was $1.16‐million. While those who take part in such actions are willing to accept the consequences, Father O'Rourke said, there has been a shift from the nonviolence of the nineteen‐sixties civil rights era in that those involved “will never submit that they are just penalties.” No Contradiction Seen He said that those in the movement see no contradiction between their actions and their commitment to Christianity. The gospel, he said, is a “cen tral document” in their lives: He and others such as Father Fordi, he said, see Jesus as a revolutionary “who attempted to give Caesar what he de served,” and feel that “the only Christian moral postion is the revolutionary one.” All those arrested in Cam den, he said, had faced their “jailers with great courage, talked with them, indicated that they forgave them.” Support, at least in terms of phone calls, for the Camden group was coming yesterday from antiwar activists all over the country, Father O'Rourke said, but he laughed at the idea of a formal conspiracy of activ ists, an interlocking directorate that planned and carried out actions in concert. In Camden, a coordinating center in support of the 21 was set up in St. Mary's School, according to a spokesman for the “Harrisburg 13” defense committee here, the group which gave out the statement yesterday for “The Buffalo.” The committee was acting as a switchboard and in Porm a tion‐dispensing center for the Camden and Buffalo groups. The space in Camden was provided, the spokesman said, by Msgr. Salvator Adamo, edi tor of the Camden diocesan newspaper and was being staffed by members of the Catholic Peace Fellowship.

1343-> Froehling and Ashe Reach French Net Quarterfinals
PARIS, May 31—Two Amer icans gained the quarterfinals today in the French open ten nis championships, a tourna ment that isn't what it used to be. Arthur Ashe of Gum Springs, Va., seeded No. 2, had more trouble adding to his week‐and a half‐old mustache than in de feating Georges Goven, the Frenchman seeded 15th, by 6.4, 6‐4, 7‐5. Frank Froehling 3d lured out of a five‐year retirement last July by a chance to be the pro at a new $1.5‐million club at Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (“If I regain my stature”), up set Marty Riessen of Evanston, 111., 1‐6, 2‐6, 6‐3, 6‐4, 6‐2. Ries sen was seeded seventh. Tomorrow Stan Smith, Cliff, Richey and Bob Lutz will try to join their compatriots in the final eight, as the United States has its best chance of winning the men's title here since Tony Trabert did it in 1955. Age, taxes, injuries and babies have combined, how ever, to reduce the stature of the tournament, once ranked behind only Wimbledon and Forest Hills. Though it carries a $95,000 purse, with $11,520 going to the men's winner, most of the professionals think the world clay‐court championships, as the tournament is generally re garded, are no longer worth the time and effort. Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall, the aging Australian, passed up the event on slow, heavy courts at Roland Garros Stadium to rest for Wimbledon. They also do not like the idea of working two weeks, with five‐set matches and no tiebreakers, to earn what they usually make for a few nights on the World Championship Tennis circuit. In addition, they dislike the 20 per cent tax on prize money. Mrs. John Newcombe and Mrs. Tom Okker recently had babies and Tony Roche and Cliff Drysdale are injured. Of the 32 players under contract to W.C.T., only 16 were en tered here—and only Ashe and Lutz were left. Riessen said most of the players now felt that the Bris tol (England) tournament, a Wimbledon tune‐up, was more important than the French. ?? ?? “After all,” he said, “you can make the same money there in only half the time.” Bristol is only a week long. Marty seemed well on his way to victory today, easily winning the first two sets in an uncharacteristic display of rush ing the net. Nothing went wrong and Froehling said, “All I could do was laugh.” On the first point of the third set, though, Riessen broke a string on his racquet — “my magic wand,” he called it and Froehling's patience and strong forehand paid off. Ashe, content to stay at the baseline, used brilliant, fluid strokes to master Goven. The Frenchmen, who reached the semifinals last year, drew a crowd of about 10.000 to the center court. It was by far the biggest in what had been a dull tournament — so dull, said Ashe, that “I'm growing a mustache: what else is there to do here?” Ashe will meet Froehling in the quarterfinals, Ilie Nastase of Rumania, seeded third, also advanced with a 6‐1, 6‐1, 2‐6, 7‐5 victory over Tadeusz Nowicki of Poland. He will face the winner of th match between Smith, seeded sixth, and Pa trice Dominguez of France. They were tied, 4‐4, in the first set when rain postponed play.

1344-> Reply to Jarring Is Positive, Egypt Says
CAIRO, Feb. 15 — The Unit ed Arab Republic has sent “positive” reply to a peace ini tiative undertaken last week by Dr. Gunnar V. Jarring, the Un ited Nations intermediary in the Arab‐Israeli conflict, it was re ported here tonight by Salah Gohar, Under Secretary of the Foreign Ministry. The initiative, involving questions to Egypt and Israel about their terms for a settle ment, was, reported to have raised the prospect of a com plete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied. Sinai Peninsula in exchange for Egyptian recogni tion of Israeli sovereignty. The Israeli Government has reacted coldly to Dr. Jarring's initiative, reportedly because it felt that the initiative expressed Dr. Jarring's personal views, and that he was overstepping his mandate. The Egyptian Cabinet met yesterday to hear a report by Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad on the Jarring efforts. Approval by Cairo was virtually taken for granted after editorial praise here of the initiative. The Cairo Government was also reported tonight to have been favorably impressed, by remarks yesterday of Joseph J. Sisco, the United States Assist ant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs. On the Columbia Broadcasting System television program “Face the Nation,” Mr. Sisco upheld Dr. Jarring's move. He also commended the continu ing effort of President Anwar el‐Sadat to seek a political solu tion of the conflict.

1345-> Economist Expects Interest‐Rate Rise In 2d Half of Year
If interest rates continue to move higher, the rise will set in motion a series of financial events that eventually will abort the current economic re covery, Henry Kaufman, part ner and economist at Salomon Brothers, warned yesterday. Speaking at a meeting of the New York Society of Security Analysts, Mr. Kaufman predict ed that both short‐term and long‐term interest rates would he higher in the second half! of the year. The yield on three‐month Treasury bills, for example, will “probably move into the 5 to 5½ per cent range,” he said. These short‐term securities, were auctioned yesterday at slightly below 4.50 per cent. For long‐term high‐grade cor porate bonds, “the best we can hope” are yields that will fluc tuate in the 7½ to 8½ per cent! range for the rest of the year, Mr. Kaufman said. A continued large volume of new bond offerings, however, would push corporate bond yields above 8½ per cent, he cautioned. And he warned that “a large falloff” in corporate bond financing, though logical in view of the substantial im provement in corporate liquidity since last fall, was “far from certain.” The, renewed pressures in the credit markets “have important implications” for the economy itself, the economist empha sized. “An additional escalation in interest rates will gradually change the expectations of a continued economic recovery because it will arouse suspi cions that such an economic recovery may not be financially feasible to sustain,” he stated. A continued rise in interest rates may invite a substantial slowdown in the deposit inflows to thrift institutions and result in a return of disintermediation. This, in turn, would result in a decrease in homebuilding. Dis intermediation is the flow of funds out of intermediaries, such as banks and mutual funds, into direct investment. In addition, higher interest rates would slow the currently large volume of long‐term tax exempt financing and speed the sale of local government notes, he said. Furthermore, the Fed eral Government would con tinue to put its emphasis on short‐term Treasury financing. The “most startling impact” of any additional rise in inter est rates, he said, will be on the financing patterns of cor porations. The volume of me dium‐term bond issues should increase and, if stock prices remain as high as they are now, the volume of new equity fi nancing and convertible‐bond financing will accelerate sharply, he added. Mr. Kaufman gave these rea sons to account for the rise in interest rates during the last three months, a setback he described as “quite alarming.” He cited: ¶The consensus view that the economic slowdown of 1970 was over. ¶The general expectation of more vigorous economic im provement next year. ¶The reversal in the down ward trend in short‐term rates. ¶“Exceedingly large” trading positions that had helped fuel the bond market rally through early 1971. ¶The continued strong per formance of the stock market. ¶The continued large demand for long‐term funds. ¶The international monetary crisis, which caused investors to conclude that short‐term rates would not be permitted to decline again. ¶And a shift in attitude to ward Federal Reserve opera tions now to interpreting pur chases on long‐term Govern ment issues as “a sign of mar ket weakness.” On balance, he concluded, the current situation in the money and bond markets “is rather precarious.”

1346-> Last‐Minute Concessions Made to Iraq by Oil Concerns to Avoid Alienating Her
TEHERAN, Iran, Feb. 15— Western oil concerns made special concessions to Iraq in the closing hours of the Persian Gulf price negotiations rather than risk alienating her radical Arab leadership, Western sources disclosed today. The oil executives hope that, as a result, they have bought Iraqi support in the coming confrontation with Libya over price increases in the Medi terranean area. Various details of the nego tiations are emerging following yesterday's agreement by 23 international oil companies to increase their payments to six Persian Gulf states by more than $1.2‐billion in the first year of a five‐year contract. The six Governments were already expecting about $4.4‐ billion, or roughly two‐thirds of their budget, in oil revenues this year. “By any standard, it was an enormous settlement,” said an American close to the negoti ations. “We knew It would be high but they had us,” he con tinued. “Where else are you going to get that much oil? I think you are going to see a lot more exploration in other parts of the world.” However; the oil men saw compensatin'g advantages in what their formal statement yesterday called “security of supply and stability in finan cial arrangements for a five‐ year period.” They were not so much concerned about meeting immediate cost in creases as in facing, new, de mands from country to country every, six months or so. Although the agreement is for fixed, increases, some oil executives are fearful that changed political circumstances in the Gulf area might bring pressure for renegotiation be fore the expiration date, The companies: directly rep resented on the negotiating team were British Petroleum, the largest Gulf producer, Standard Oil of New. Jersey, Mobil Oil; Texaco and nental Oil. The operations center was the red and purple royal suite on, the 15th floor of the Royal Teheran Hilton. The suburban hotel, set against a backdrop of the snow‐covered Elburz Mountains, is a half‐hour taxi ride from the conference rooms at the Iranian Ministry of Fi nance. The ministry is in the poorer quarter of Teheran, near the bazaar. There were constant Telex communications between the oil men here and a group of some 60 executives, representing all the affected companies, as sembled in London. They met in a lower‐level conference room in the 32‐story headquarters building of British Petroleum. There was also liaison with another executive gioup in New York. Consultations were painstak ingly pursued, oil men here said, to preclude any com pany's later cornplaint it had unwittingly been bound to a costly settlement. The major American companies had made sure that they included a lead ing independent producers. Continental, on the negotiating team to forestall antitrust com plications. Both sides in the riegotia tions said that the atmosphere had always been friendly de spite some strong Iraqi state menta at the outset. At the end, Iraq's Oil Min ister, Dr. Saadun Hamadi, al most upset the agreement by insisting on concessions to pro tect Iraq's high‐sulphur crude oil, which is disadvantageously exported through Basra, on the Persian Gulf. The Western oil team ap parently took a deliberately tough stand, blocking agree Merit on, Saturday and splitting the Gulf negotiators to such extent that a settlement without Iraq, was considered. But the companies yielded in the interests of good relations for the future, conference sources said.

1347-> TURKS INVADE BASE AND REMOVE A G.I.
ANKARA, Turkey, Feb. 15 (AP)—A small band seized an Air Force sergeant inside a United States military instal lation early today, fled with him in an American truck after shooting past unarmed gate guards, then released him 17 hours later. The sergeant, Jimmy Ray Finley, walked into his head quarters unharmed at 9 P.M. and underwent questioning by Air Force investigators. They gave no details of his abduc tion. Officials said the kidnappers were believed to be among the leftist extremists responsible for a wave of terrorist attacks on United States military men in Turkey, which is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The truck used to make the getaway was found with a flat tire and its motor running on a road about 10 miles outside Ankara later in the day. There was no sign of Sergeant Fin ley, a 24‐year‐old air police man from Fort Worth, Tex., or of the kidnappers.

1349-> TRIAL OF CALLEY RESUMING TODAY
FORT BENNING, Ga., Feb. 15 — The murder trial of first Lieut. William L. Calley Jr. enters its climactic phase to morrow with the resumption of the court‐martial of the 27‐ year‐old officer charged with the mass execution of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians dur ing the so called Mylai mas score. Lieutenant Calley is expected to take the stand before the end of the week. But first, the de fense will attempt to place be fore the jury of six officers the testimony of civilian psychia trists. These psychiatrists would be expected to testify that Lieu tenant Calley had “behaved like a robot” and lacked the capa city to disobey an order that, the defense charges, called for the indiscriminate killing of all villagers regardless of age or sex. It was such testimony on Lieutenant Calley's “mental re sponsibility” that brought the trial to a sudden halt four weeks ago. With the jury absent, Col. Reid W. Kennedy, the military judge, heard a sample of psychiatric testimony from Dr. Albert A. LaVerne, senior psychiatrist at the New York University Bellevue Medi cal Center. Lieutenant Calley had a com pulsion to obey his company commander and “father im age,” Capt. Ernest L. Medina, according to Dr. LaVerne. And perhaps the young officer was under the influence of mari juana fumes produced by oth er soldiers, the psychiatrist added. Tests on Lieutenant Calley found no evidence that the young officer had the charac teristics to commit premeditat ed murder, Dr. LaVerne said. Judge Kennedy then recessed the trial, already more than two months old, for four weeks to give the Government time to explore Lieutenant Calley's mental state by its own psychi atrists. A “sanity board” of Army psychiatrists examined the lieu tenant at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. The findings have been transmitted to Judge Kennedy, who sent copies to attorneys for the defense and prosecu tion today. He gave the Gov ernment an expurgated report, deleting the sanity board's in terviews with Lieutenant Calley —interviews that might con tain incriminating matter. What the Army psychiatrists reported may not become known until the Government prosecutor, Capt. Aubrey M. Daniel 3d, calls them as rebut tal witnesses. However, they may never be heard at all, for Captain Daniel has filed a mo tion to bar the defense psychi atrists from testifying, arguing that they have added nothing to the case. The Calley trial, which began in early November, is expected to last another three weeks at least. Lieutenant Calley was the central figure of an alleged massacre on March 16, 1968, in a tiny hamlet called Mylai Four, where he is said to have gunned down 102 unarmed men, women and children. The Army, which at one point accused 25 officers and enlisted men on various counts, has not obtained a conviction. The score stands at two ac quittals, with charges dropped against 20. Last month, the Army dropped charges against the highest ranking officer involved, Maj Gen. Samuel Koster, former Superintendent of West Point, who commanded the Americal Division at the time of the in cident and was accused of com plicity in covering up the al leged massacre. In the proceedings against Lieutenant Calley, the only My lai trial now under way, five Government witnesses have supported the Government's charge that Lieutenant Calley participated in the mass mur der of noncombatants. The defense has not denied that the officer killed some Vietnamese at Mylai. Instead, the defense has offered evi dence that Lieutenant Calley was led to believe that every inhabitant of the village was either an enemy or an enemy sympathizer, and that he was under orders to “kill every liv ing thing.”

1350-> Higher Order of Energy
MWANDISHI (Warner Brothers) is music that will take you by surprise. It sounds like jazz, but it comes across to you with the evocative, personal directness of song. Once you are oriented, it is accessible to any kind of mu sical sensibility— rock, clas sical or jazz. It is the work of a group of six musicians led by 31‐year‐old electric pianist‐and‐composer Herbie Hancock. It is new jazz. New jazz is … well, to begin with a metaphor: Clas sical music is crossing the river on a bridge (as is rock, just a different bridge). Tra ditional jazz is crossing the river by knowing where the rocks are and jumping from one to the next. New jazz is crossing the river by know ing where the rocks (and the bridges) are, but not neces sarily using any of them to get across the river. Is this some sort of messianic ma gic? No, simply a higher or der of energy. Herbie Hancock started his career as a child prodigy pi anist, soloing at age 11 with the Chicago Symphony. He was always aware of jazz, but found it baffling, some thing only for a mature mu sician. When he was 14, how ever, he met a contemporary who was playing jazz. Amazed, he had to try for himself and soon discovered the method. A line of melody implies a sequence of chords. The total of all the notes in those chords is the basic set, in other words, the rocks in the river. A traditional jazz musician, while improvising, is jumping from rock to rock in his own style. Within this basic structure — known as “playing off the chords” — a master distinguishes him self by the subtlety of his moves, and ultimately calls forth an emotional response. One of the greats for a broad audience is Miles Davis, with whom Hancock played from 1963 to 1968. The moment of truth came when one day Hancock realized as they were playing that he was get ting in Miles's way. To Han cock's confusion, Miles was not playing off the chords, so he sat and let the music go by, not knowing at first what to do. This was, in fact, the moment in which new jazz was born. What Miles Davis had dis covered, arid Hancock soon after, was that even the struc ture, the set of rocks, was unnecessary, and that they could play directly off the patterns of emotions. This is the discovery that has taken jazz out of what is for many people its specialized, elitist realm, a musical equivalent to chess, and thrown the doors open to everyone. What, then, determines the patterns of emotions? The in tricate and complex environ ment in which we are all living and to which we are all contributing. For example, Hancock describes being alive abstractly as a multi level web of tensions and re leases whose source is the energy in the environment. The way his music works is as a carrier of these tensions and releases, in much the same way as an electric ca ble carries telephone conver sations. Thus Hancock and his band form an incredibly sensitive receiver‐transmitter. All you need to pick up their beautiful signals is an open ness of mind that will per mit you to accept the same range of sonic experiences in music that you unquestion ingly accept every day in life. The first track on the al bum “Mwandishi” is called “Ostinato (Suite for Angela)” and was dedicated as an aft erthought. Intimates of An gela Davis, however, find in its smooth, driving repeated theme (Benny Maupin, bass clarinet, and Buster Williams, bass) and sudden intrusions of angular planes of tension (Eddie Henderson, trumpet, and Hancock, piano) a star tling evocation of her com plex personality. There is a brilliant solo by Hancock that explores rhythmic counter point to a degree undreamed of in classical or rock music. And Maupin's bass clarinet, while capturing all manner of reed textures, has a subtlety and refinement of sound that is impossible on saxophone. One of the revelations of the second track on the al bum is Henderson, who plays trumpet and fluegel horn with the delicacy and breath lessness of a flute. This song is a trembling, vulnerable lyr ical experience. A long duet interweaves trumpet and pi ano and the notes hang and follow like bubbles in the air, taken up by alto flute and Williams's effortlessly nimble bass. It is entitled “You'll Know When You Get There,” and the song is itself the chronicle and the experience of discovery. The entire second side of the album is Julian Priester's “Wandering Spirit Song,” a paced, reflective, explorative piece with powerful primitive sonic elements (Billy Hart, drums), which is built around a long solo by Priester on trombone and glides through its landscape for 21 minutes. But as the band demonstrated recently at the Bitter End to an audience composed main ly of entranced rock enthusi asts, time dissolves in the energy of their music. An hour‐long set felt like 15 minutes. “Mwandishi” is Swahili for “composer,” and Hancock has worked with a wide spec trum of people from jazz mas ters like Paul Desmond, Quin cy Jones and Charlie Byrd to the film‐maker Michelangelo Antonioni for the score of his masterpiece “Blow Up.” But the genius of his new jazz is that it dwells in emotion and concept, and is there fore, a universal language— an event in which we all take part.

1351-> Advertising:
Doyle Dane Bernbach of West 43d Street acquired yesterday Cargill, Wilson & Acree of Atlanta, Birming ham, Charlotte and Rich mond. The publicly held, 22‐ year‐old company has had five domestic offices and five in ternational offices but none in the Southeast, where C. W. & A., a $20‐million shop, has its strength. The acquisition was ac complished with an undis closed amount of stock and cash. The Southern agency will retain its name and offi cers and, according to Edward Acree, board chairman, three people from D.D.B. will probably be joining its four‐ man board, bringing the total to seven. C.W. & A. will be an auton omous subsidiary. Other D.D.B. subsidiaries are Snark Products, a boat manufac turer, and the Directors' Studio, a TV‐commercial pro duction house. D.D.B., public since 1964, is the country's sixth largest agency and had worldwide billings last year of more than $275‐million. C.W. & A. was founded in 1950 as Cargill & Co., by James N. Cargill, who re cently gave up the board chairman's job and yesterday retired from the business. Robert A. Wilson is chairman of the executive committee and Harry M. Jacobs has been president since Febru ary. The agency became Cargill & Wilson in 1953 and took its present name in 1958. Its long client list included several banks and power companies and, according to Mr. Acree, there are no conflicts with D.D.B. clients.

1352-> Elusive Music— But a Pleasant Place to Be
(Atlan tic). Graham Nash al ways came across as the most quiet and unassum ing of the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young combine. There was —and is—a charming reti cence to his manner that made pleasant contrast to the more charismatic qualities of the other group members. His solo album confirms these impressions. Even though, as in songs like “Chi cago” and “We Can Change The World,” he expresses sentiments that are every bit as politically and socially ag gressive as those of, say, Da vid Crosby or Steve Stills, Nash always sounds almost apologetically reserved. I suspect that he is at his best when he is writing and sing ing songs that recall the de ceptive coolness of the Hol lies, the English group he be longed to before joining C, S, N & Y. “Simple Man” is a good example and a tune that probably is more per sonal than any other, along with the peculiarly bitter sweet “I Used To Be A King” and “Man In The Mirror.” It's a good album, even though its refusal to insist upon the listener's attention can make it a little elusive to get into. But once you're in, there's no question that Graham Nash's music is a pleasant place to be. (Mer cury). All I can do is gnash my teeth that Rod Stewart has never managed to find a back‐up group that will give him the support he needs and deserves. Stewart is a lead singer par excellence, a fine English perform er who followed in the wake of Mick Jagger but, lacking a group like the Rolling Stones, has floundered around from one set of anonymous musicians to an other. He tries hard, though (maybe even harder). And this collection is pretty char acteristic of what happens. Stewart sings his tail off, but is shot down by accompani ment that is frequently abys mally out of tune and some times just inept. His superb singing on Bob Dylan's “To morrow Is Such A Long Time,” his own “Maggie May” and Tim Hardin's “Reason To Believe” gets lost in the process. The music business is not exactly brim ming over with dynamite male rock singers, these days, so it's hard to under stand why Stewart isn't get ting better production and more competent backing. He's got everything he needs to be a winner, but it hasn't happened yet. (At lantic—Syntonic Research, Inc.). The principle behind the Syntonic Research rec ordings suggests that our stereo systems can be used for more than the reproduc tion of music. For example, instead of looking at our speakers and imagining a concert stage or a recording studio, suppose we could re ceive the aural stimuli of a wave‐tossed beach or a quietly stirring country morning. At its worst, it's the sort of enterprise that can result in little more than glorified sound effects. But produced carefully and mixed in a fashion that fully exploits the potential of state‐of‐the‐art stereo sound reproduction, the effects can be striking, indeed. Earlier Syntonic Research recordings have been devot ed to seashores, country mornings and trance‐like synthesized bell sounds. This one includes “Dusk At New Hope, Pennsylvania” and “Be‐in (A Psycho‐acoustic Experience).” The “Be‐in,” taped in Central Park in April 1969, doesn't live up to its billing. As I recall, it was a complete sensory trip —aural, visual, tactile, you name it—and can hardly have the same effect in a sound‐only context (even if it is “psycho‐acoustic,” what ever that may be). The New Hope evening murmurs are much better, extraordinarily soothing when played at a fairly low, unobtrusive vol ume setting. If you expect to be locked in the city for these coming summer week ends, you can always use it (with your record chang er set for automatic repeat) to cover up the hum from your air conditioner. Those crickets will really get to you (and you won't even have to worry about Dr. Hel strom). (Capitol). Miss Reddy is an Australian singer who has hit the American pop charts with her version of the Mary Magdalene song, “I Don't Know How To Love Him,” from the rock opera “Jesus Christ: Super star.” Any question that she might be a one‐shot perform er should be dissipated by this beautifully balanced col lection of contemporary ma terial. Miss Reddy knows her way around the kaleidoscopic maze of today's pop music styles. She handles Leon Rus sell's gospel‐tinged “A Song For You” with ease, moves smartly into Tim Hardin's folky “Don't Make Promises,” romps through Van Morri son's “Crazy Love” and set tles back nicely for Graham Nash's gentle “Our House.” She adds a couple of fas cinating originals, and ap proaches each song with an obvious sympathy for its spe cial subtleties. Most import ant, she doesn't get lost in the process. Miss Reddy un derstands the dangers of imi tation, and focuses the es sence of her personality at the heart of everything she sings. Good interpretive per formers are rare, so it's al ways good to hear one who can cut the mustard. (Warner Brothers). It's taken me quite a while to get into Jethro Tull's music. Ian Anderson's vocalized flute playing never did much for me, and I was generally more aware of the group's musical failings than I was of their charismatic presence as per formers. To their credit, however, they have continu ed to develop as musicians without sacrificing the sheer animal magnetism that has made them such an electric performance group. “Aqualung” is far and away the best recording they have made: it deserves care ful listening, both to the music and the lyrics. Most of the tracks are concerned with various aspects of An derson's perception of God. The idea for the album, in fact, started with a song called “My God,” which An derson describes—accurate ly, I would say—as “a blues —a lament for God.” The most fascinating pieces to me, however, are the title song (with lyrics by Anderson's wife, Jennie), the story of a human castoff who surely is one of the Deity's most woebegone creatures, and “Cross‐Eyed Mary,” Aqualung's female counter part. Anderson once spoke rather cynically about music in an interview I had with him, but I suspect that he was not yet fully aware of his powers (this was over a year ago). “Aqualung” sug gests that those powers may still be in their expanding stage. At a time when Jesus Freak rock music is rapidly becoming one of the most commercially viable items, Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull have made an honest and in its own way, extremely re ligious recording. It should be heard, particularly by those who have been loudly crowing the virtues of “Jesus Christ: Superstar.” “Aqua lung” might help clear their ears, and that's a start.

1353-> City's Business Role Stressed; Printing Industries Unit Elects
New York's continuing pro gram to increase its industrial and commercial facilities, to improve transportation and to attend to the housing problem will keep the city as the prime business center of the world, Ralph C. Gross, president of the Commerce and Industry Associ ation, said here last night. Mr. Gross spoke at the an nual meeting of the Printing Industries of Metropolitan New York, Inc., in the Commodore Hotel. At the meeting, the association elected Eli Cantor, chairman of the board of The Composing Room, a printing concern, as its chairman. He succeeds Robert D. Lane, of the Hygrade Printing Corporation. Among the steps taken by New York to maintain its pre eminent position as an inter national center for commerce and industry, Mr. Gross pointed out, are the following: ¶Development of 22 in dustrial park sites, now under varying stages of construction. ¶Cornmercial development of so‐called sub‐business centers in the downtown Brooklyn, Ja maica, and Fordham Road sec tions of the city. ¶A loan program for job de velopment that provides long term second mortgages to cover the cost of land, construction or renovations of plants. ¶New public transportation facilities and renovation of ex isting mass transit. ¶Board of Estimate approval for construction of a consolida ted passenger terminal from 48th Street to 52nd Street and construction of new shipping container facilities in Brooklyn and Staten Island. Elected as vice chairmen of the board of the printing as sociation were Ralph Seplow of Skilset Typographers and Arthur Borock of The Letter Guild. Joseph Gebbia of the Hista count Corporation was elected treasurer and Leonard Friedman of the Carey Press Corporation, secretary.

1354-> Art Notes
PIER 18, a rinky‐dink Hudson River structure recently ravaged fur ther by fire, is hardly what you'd call a prime art showcase. But last winter it served as the setting for one of the season's liveliest art occasions—a two‐month af fair for which each of 27 con cept‐oriented artists created a piece related to the pier. Non‐swimmer Lee Jaffe, for instance, while holding a Persian cat, had himself lashed, Ulysses‐like, to a “mast” that dangled peril ously over the water. Wolf gang Stoerchle had a friend pile wood in his arms, then lurched along the pier until he stumbled and dropped the pile. And Allen Ruppersberg, a Coast conceptualist, cast on the water a suitcase wrapped in chains, its interior con taining a brick from the Hollywood home of Houdini (with Houdini‐esque chutz pah, it stayed afloat). Ephemeral, you say? Well, missed at the time by all but a handful of devotees, the show lives on in a series of brilliant documentary photo graphs currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art. Unadornedly titled “Pier 18,” it was birthed and nurtured by Willoughby Sharp, exhibi tion organizer, impresario of downtown doings, and pub lisher of the art quarterly, Avalanche. * “It was an extension of my exhibitions, ‘Earth Art’ (Cor nell, 1969) and ‘Place and Process’ (Edmonton, Alberta, same year), in which the works were a response to specific sites,” says Sharp, who has no less than 24 shows under his wide belt. “I'm also concerned that a number of artists are doing work that doesn't get out into the culture.” Sharp stumbled on Pier 18 last November—“a perfect place, totally disassociated from art‐making and open to a large variety of work.” He got on the pipe to a number of outdoor site‐responders— conceptualists, “process” and “body” artists (who use their own anatomy as a medium). Their response was — well, heartening. Some did their thing in terms of the pier's physical structure — George Trakas, for instance, paddled around it in a sort of kayak to make drawings; Bill Wegman re mained in California but speci fied that a professional bowler he hired to send a ball down the pier and scatter a row of ninepins (the ball splashed into the soup). Others made use of the cam era. For one of his pieces, John Baldessari squaréd his fingers before the lens to frame a nearby ship (see right); Mario Merz, absent in Italy, asked photographers to take 20 shots that “pre cisely annotated” the pier. And still others established a “body” relationship with the structure. Using various parts of his anatomy (hands, knees, chest) as a camera tripod, Dan Graham snapped whatever came into range to produce a series of topsy turvy cityscapes; non‐swim mer Vito Acconci, ears plug ged, hands bound, eyes blind folded, had himself led about the rickety pier by a comrade whose motives he didn't “fully trust.” As with much conceptual art, the work — important more for the sake of idea than object—was performed primarily for the camera. “I didn't have permission to use the pier, and it was obvious that people couldn't see the work in situ,” Sharp explains. “So it had to be recorded. Then I thought of transfer ring it via the photographic process back to the museum site.” Et voila! MOMA snap ped it up, though reports have it that the museum wanted mainly to fill a sum mer gap and is somewhat surprised by the success of its sleeper show. None of the artists got a fee, no work was sold, and nobody was paid, including Janos Render and Harry Slnk, the young photo graphic team whose genius at documenting artists' work deserves wider recognition. (Ironically, despite the “anti object” stance of most of the performers, Shunk ‐ Kender's documentary photos are works of art—art objects—in their own right. But “Pier 18” is in line with an increas ing trend among artists to work outside the traditional confines of the museum gallery structure—in parks, streets, trees, on mountain tops, in the sky, and even underwater. “I like the free dom to work out of a specific place that's still around the city and accessible to people,” says Bill Beckley, whose “sound” piece involved playing eight descending notes on a trumpet as a snap ping turtle “descended” ‘an improvised ramp. For Sharp, who believes that art “in the sense of con sumable objects” is dead, and “the structure and economy supporting that kind of art is crumbling,” the pier show and its documentation is one way of insuring that the new work gets exposure to the public. “In the last few years, no one's really looked at modern art—the process and conceptual pieces that are often of only fleeting dura tion. That may be because none of the new work con forms to traditional defini tions of what art is—in fact, I'm not even sure you could call it art anymore.” What ever it is, MOMA viewers seem to find “Pier 18” very much worth their attention. After having recently won its 2½ fight to get artists' residence legalized in downtown SoHo, previously zoned only for light manu facturing, Citizens for Art ists Housing turned around to discover a further hurdle. Under the state's Multiple Dwelling Law, now applied to SoHo, artists could only improve their lofts for joint studio‐living occupancy by building codes so rigid that they virtually prohibited re novation of the seedy manu facturing buildings they occu pied. * “The city finally said, ‘OK, live there,’ ” says Doris Freed man, chairman of Citizens for Artists Housing, “but now artists were faced with the problem of how to live there safely and comfortably.” Members of the C.A.H. Volun teer Architects Committee set to work, as did another group called Volunteer Law yers for the Arts. The result: a drafted amendment that made the law more flexible without violating its safety or health standards. A slew of meetings with the Building Department, the Fire Department, the City. Planning Commission and other city agencies produced support for the new amend ment, introduced in the Leg islature by Sen. Roy Good man and Assemblyman Wil liam Passanante. Passed on June 7. a speedy 10 weeks after its introduction, the amendment was signed into law by Gov. Rockefeller on July 6. Isn't it nice to hear the State's done something for the city? Mrs. John V. Lindsay has accepted the honorary chair manship of the New York chapter of the Venice Com mittee of the International Fund for Monuments. The committee, primarily con cerned with saving the art and architecture of Venice, is restoring churches, palaces and art treasures in the en dangered city… After recent deliberations, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has decided not to take over operation of the new Pasa dena Art Museum, suffering heavy building and opera tional deficits. To stream line expenses this summer, the museum will stay open only four days a week. In cidently, Pasadena recently appointed as director William C. Agee, formerly assistant curator of painting and sculp ture at New York's Museum of Modern Art. … The Nyack, N.Y. birthplace of the late Edward Hopper, recently de clared a state landmark, has been acquired by the Edward Hopper Landmark Preserva tion Committee, a group of local citizens. Plan: to restore the house for display of Hop per's work and for use as a local cultural center.

1356-> State Crime Agency Seeks to Review Tax Returns
ALBANY, Feb. 15—The head of the state's new organized crime task force is seeking au thority from the Legislature to review state income tax returns for evidence of criminal activi ties and official corruption. Deputy Attorney General Robert E. Fischer, the head of the new agency, said in an in terview that he had conferred with aides of Governor Rocke feller and Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz in drafting legislation. The unit now has the power to subpoena records, including tax returns, but the authority sought by Mr. Fischer would grant tax‐return review power as a routine tool of the agency. This power is now limited by law to enforcement agents of the State Department of Tax ation and Finance who, Mr. Fischer said, are primarily in terested in such questions as tax delinquency rather than in uncovering patterns of organ ized crime. The initial reaction from Senate Republican Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges was cool. “I pull away from this a little bit,” he said, asserting that the Federal Government already was “deeply” involved in reviewing tax returns for this purpose. The task force, established by the Legislature last year at Governor Rockefeller's request, is opening offices in White Plains, Rochester and Albany. A staff of 11 lawyers, several accountants and 52 investi gators from the state police has begun work in three re gions. Their first‐year budget is expected to be about $1‐mil lion, shared equally by the state and Federal Government. In his annual legislative message last month, the Gov ernor noted that “tax law violations have been success fully employed as the basis of organized crime prosecutions, particularly by Federal authori ties.” He said he would pro pose a “substantial increase” in criminal penalties for violation of state tax laws.” Mr. Fischer has the delicate job, at $37,500 a year, of trying to get the new state unit mov ing while causing a minimum of friction with established law agencies. The task force is looked upon by many observers as a proto type of the controversial De partment of Criminal Justice requested by the Governor in a proposed constitutional amend ment. An amendment to estab lish such a department was approved by the Legislature last year and must be passed again this year if it is to be put to the voters in a refer endum. The department, headed by an appointed commissioner, would have more extensive powers than the present task force or the Attorney General's office. It would have authority to “assist, coordinate and su pervise” various law‐enforce ment agencies in the state, in cluding district attorneys and police departments. The State District Attorneys Association is opposed to the amendment, arguing that local district attorneys are well able to handle the problem of or ganized crime and that law en forcement would be radically altered by having an appointed official supervise elected dis trict attorneys. The amendment passed in both houses last year by com fortable margins. Legislative sources say the outlook appears favorable for second pas sage in the next few weeks, although some opponents are arguing that the matter should be deferred until the work of the task force can be reviewed. Observers note that Mr. Fischer “has to live with the D.A.'s,” and he is given some early credit for tact. Bronx District Attorney Bur ton B. Roberts, for example, said Mr. Fischer had supplied his office with a special ac countant for a long‐term, diffi cult inquiry. He also praised William M. Tendy, a former Federal prosecutor who is di rector of the White Plains of fice, which includes the New York City area, and Mr. Tendy's assistant, Moses Weintraub, an accountant and lawyer. While hailing “cooperation,” however, Mr. Roberts empha sized his opposition to the “supervision” provided for in the proposed amendment. Critics of the proposed de partment note that the Gov ernor always has had the au thority to supersede a local dis trict attorney by appointing a special prosecutor. But sup porters reply that this author ity is rarely used and that the problem of organized crime re quires something more potent. The new crime unit entered the investigation of a series of bombings last fall in Rochester and has participated in some upstate gambling raids, but oth erwise, its specific activities are not discussed by Mr. Fischer. He indicated he was receiving regular reports on a score of matters in various parts of the state and has been using sub poena powers. The original task force bill last year would have provided the unit with authority to pre sent evidence on its own to local grand juries and to prose cute cases. But this was wa tered down to leave district attorneys with the option of seeking indictments and of prosecuting.

1357-> Art
LAST year I learned from a number of book reviews that Florentine painting, if not exactly in the dog house, had become sort of a bore to people nowadays. This was a sur prise, since I had become accustomed to thinking of Masaccio, Botticelli, and all those others as art‐historical con stants, and had never imagined the Uffizi as the House of Yawns. Now, hav ing wasted some months cultivating an up‐to‐the‐minute post‐Berenson ennui, I discover that either the Metropolitan and the Cleveland Museum of Art are still behind the times or the pendulum has gone into its return swing. Both museums have installed Florentine shows. Neither exhibition beats any drums or makes any effort at re‐interpretation. The Metropolitan's is simply a line‐up of all the museum's Florentine paintings— and an impressive group it is—on the occasion of the publication of a new catalogue. What I liked about it was that everything, from masterpieces to workshop jobs, some in the best of condition and others almost indecipher able in decay, is there for you to see at once, supplying a side‐by‐side context that shows how common roots could have produced blossoms of such contrasting nature. For anyone acquaint ed in a general way with the history of Florentine art no new information is offered, but the routine facts of the stan dard art history book take on a new vividness. This was unexpected as far as I was concerned and I suspect that even the curators who hung the pictures were unaware, until they saw them in place, that they were going to have a revealing show on their hands instead of a simple enumeration of the Floren tine works the Metropolitan owns. In Cleveland the goal was quite dif ferent. Again, with the exception of a very few loans, this is an assembling of material in the museum's various collections — paintings, sculptures, draw ings, prints, and decorative arts hand somely arranged as an introduction to Florentine art. It is a much smaller show than the Metropolitan's in spite of the variety of material included, and has fewer high spots in spite of such a pin nacle as the finest extant impression of the finest Florentine engraving, Polla iuolo's “Battle of Naked Men.” As a thumbnail survey the Cleveland show is a bit heavy on later work, giving more emphasis to Florentine grace, sweetness, and high style than to that wonderful muscular dryness that characterized the first half of the fif teenth century when Florence was most Florentine. But Edmund Pillsbury (a Ford Foundation intern), who organized the show and wrote its catalogue, has given it a handsome — even a seduc tive — installation in the museum's new wing, managing to evoke echoes of a Florentine setting without violating Marcel Breuer's rather stern architec ture. * It is somehow typical of a visit to the Cleveland Museum—although I have no idea why — that you find youself ab sorbed in the examination of exquisite refinements and subtleties of exactly the kind that are usually smothered in big museums by the weight of sheer numbers and drowned out by the the atricalism of the largest, most aggressive works, Mr. Pillsbury's selection has this special allure. The engravings and small sculptures establish themselves as the heart of the show. These two exhibitions lengthen the list that marks 1971 as the year Ameri can museums discovered their built‐in survival kits. With funds shorter every where, with all museums feeling the pinch and some of the biggest ones real ly strapped, curators have been pulling shows out of their own store rooms or simply rearranging things on the walls to make new points, saving tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars in in surance, transportation, and the moun tain of other expenses involved in put ting a loan show together. Some mu seums are exhibiting for the first time in their own galleries works that other museums exhibited as loans. * The Metropolitan's Florentine show, probably regarded only as a filler, must have cost nothing at all. (It was not even necessary to repaint the galleries.) Its “Ancient Egyptian Writing” show, one of the brightest in a long time, was a dark horse regarded, during its or ganization, as a bit of harmless self indulgence on the part of the Egyptian department's curators, who pulled all the material out of storage. Cleveland might have arranged a more conventionally impressive Florentine show by negotiat ing loans — still possible, though more and more difficult—but the cost, the time, and the general agony would have been out of all proportion to any Im provement in the home‐grown product. It is not even true that people who know their local museum well get less from seeing familiar material rearranged. Clevelanders are going to see things in Mr. Pillsbury's show in connections that they have never known before. New Yorkers for the same reason are be ginning to discover for the first time what the Museum of Modern Art is all about. Nothing is more irritating than to be told that a spot of bad luck is going to be good for you after all, but it does begin to appear that hard times are setting curators on a course where im aginative conception will be more im portant than the prestige look in exhibi tions—a lesson that will be good to remember even if all these money troubles clear up.

1358-> Wartime Papers Tell of U.S.‐British Pledge on Atomic Weapons
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 — Wartime agreements between the United States and Britain on atomic energy—including a pledge not to use atomic weap ons against “third parties” without each other's consent— are detailed in a new series of Government documents made public by the State Depart ment today. These agreements came at the Quebec conference between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill on Aug. 19, 1943. The two leaders agreed “never” to use atomic weapons against each other and not to communicate atomic informa tion to “third parties” except by mutual consent. Finally, tak ing note of the predominant United States contribution to the development of atomic energy, Churchill waived what was described as postwar “in dustrial or commercial” advan tages from wartime atomic de velopments that the United States President might not con sider fair and just. It was recalled that there had been friction between the United States and Britain over the possibility of British indus trial military and commercial advantages in the postwar era through sharing in atomic secrets developed by the United States at great cost. The new volume of docu ments, comprising more than 1,300 pages, covers the leaders' conferences in Washington and Quebec in 1943 before and after Italy's surrender. Among the documents was a draft memorandum from Boose velt to Churchill in May, 1943, in which the President in veighed against Charles de Gaulle, then head of the Free French movement. The Roose velt Administration favored Gen. Henri H. Giraud, co‐chair man of the Frencn Committee of National Liberation in Exile. “I ant sorry but it seems to me the conduct of the bride [de Gaulle] continues to be more and more aggravated,” Roosevelt wrote. The “bride groom,” according to the Presi dent, who tried to bring de Gaulle and Giraud together, was General Giraud. “I am inclined to think when we get into France itself we will have to regard it as a mili tary occupation run by British and American generals,” the President said. About 90 per cent of the may ors and subordinate officials of French cities and departments could be used, Roosevelt sug gested, “but the top line of na tional administration must be kept in the hands of the British or American commander‐in chief. I think that this may be necessary for six months or even a year.” The memorandum was passed to Secretary of State Cordell Hull for comment, but whether it was ever taken up directly with Churchill remains unclear.

1359-> News Analysis
MOSCOW, Feb. 15—The dead lock at the Big Four talks on Berlin has produced a, notice able, probably‐inevitable, cool ing in Soviet‐West German relations. The euphoria following the signing last August of the Bonn‐Moscow treaty has faded, replaced by an old‐fashioned diplomatic war of nerves, with each side waiting for the other to make the first conces sion. The Government of Chancel lor Willy Brandt, is waiting for the Russians to yield on the Berlin question before offering the treaty to the Bundestag for ratification. The Nest Germans, who were assuring everyone six months ago that the Krem lin was eager for the treaty, are now speculating about a division in the Soviet leadership over the value of the improved relations with Bonn. And the Russians, irritated over Western pressure over Berlin, have responded in the time‐honored Russian way of hibernating for most of the winter on the matter. There have been occasional signs in the Soviet press, and offhand statements by some diplomats, that suggest that Moscow is seeking to prod Mr. Brandt to show “political courage” and offer the treaty for ratification without waiting for the Berlin concessions he has been de manding. It is highly complicated diplo macy, involving as it does not only the Americans, British and French, but also the East Germans. And in the wings the other West and East Europeans are watching to see‐what hap pens. Senior diplomats have spent many cigar‐and‐cognac sessions at the end of dinner parties arguing whether in fact the treaty will ever go into force, or, put the other way, whether the Berlin problem will ever be formally settled. The treaty in essence recog nized the inviolability of the postwar borders in Europe and opened the way for West Ger many to improve its relations with the countries of Eastern Europe. In the aftermath of the treaty signing, Bonn negotiated a similar one with poland, and is ready to do the same with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria. The prevailing view here is that for the moment a solution is more likely than not, because both Mr. Brandt and the Krem lin have invested too much time and personal prestige in the project. Both Premier Aleksei N. Ko sygin and the party leader, Leo nid I. Brezhnev, have told Mr. Brandt that they regard the treaty as an important step and diplomats here believe that is still true. In a situation of im proved relations, the Russians can make further inroads into the Western alliance, diminish ing American influence on the continent. And the treaty is the cornerstone of Mr. Brandt's Eastern policy. The difficulties, however, are not minor since they go to the heart of Europe's postwar problems. And therefore they were predictable. Indeed, sev eral North Atlantic ambassa dors are freely displaying “I told you so” attitudes when discussing what has happened since August. Some Americans, with long and cynical experience in deal ing with Russians, say the strains between Moscow and Bonn were inevitable when Mr. Brandt did not abide by what they regard as cardinal rules of negotiating with the Rus sians: leave nothing ambiguous in the final document, and al low no assumptions to be left unwritten. Mr. Brandt's position from the start was that he would not allow the treaty too into force unless the Russians and the Western allies made prog ress at the Big Four talks on Berlin. His definition of prog ress has been deliberately vague, but he seems to be in sisting on Soviet recognition of some West German political ties With West Berlin as well as the economic and cultural relations that Moscow seems ready to acknowledge. He would also like to see a better system of access routes worked out that would not be subject to East Berlin interfer ence whenever West German politicians held, a caucus in West Berlin. Mr. Brandt and his ruling West German Social Demo cratic party reiterated this po sition today at a meeting in West Berlin that drew expect ed protests from the East Ger mans. The Soviet position from the start was equally clear: West Berlin is a separate political entity in the heart of East Germany. If West Germany wants to negotiate better access routes, it should do so with East Germany. If West Ber liners want better communica tions with East Berlin, the West Berliners should negotiate with East Germany. If the Western allies want to talk about Ber lin, the Russians will talk with them. But under no circum stances can West Germany ne gotiate with the Soviet Union about West Berlin. In the end, because the Rus sians and the West Germans wanted a treaty, the two sides decided to negotiate without talking about West Berlin and the final treaty says nothing about the city. The West Germans left Mos cow in August after Mr. Brandt and Mr. Kosygin had signed the treaty, feeling that the Russians could have no doubts that it could not be ratified un til there was some movement on Berlin. And Mr. Brandt's as sociates suggested to newsmen that, indeed, they expected a compromise soon. Otherwise, the West Germans reasoned, why would Moscow have nego tiated the treaty. But there is equally good rea son to suspect that Moscow felt Mr. Brandt would accept some thing less than he now seems to be holding out for.

1360-> Stocks Hit Low for Year As Dow Tumbles 13.14
Stock prices broke sharply yesterday to wipe out the last vestiges of the faltering market advance of 1971. Glamour stocks and virtually all major groups felt the selling pressure as volume ran at a surprisingly low rate. The ac tion of the market reflected an absence of bids, rather than any concerted unloading of is sues, according to brokers. A total of 10.96 million share —substantially below the year's average—changed hands. The Dow‐Jones industrial average tumbled 13.14 points to finish, battered and weary, at 825.86—its lowest level of the day. This carried the blue‐chip in dicator down to its poorest close since last Dec. 23, when it finished at 823.11. The indi cator also finished almost 125 points below its 1971 high of 950, set at the end of April. “This market decline is feed ing on itself,” declared Leo Lancer, director of special stud ies for Bruns, Nordeman & Co. “There's no good news here to make the market turn around. But I'm bullish, because I think the economy will respond to the various stimulants being applied.” In a lopsided showing, the New York Stock Exchange pro duced only 291 advances and 1,148 declines. Among the losers were these glamour issues: International Business Machines, down 8⅛ to 292⅜ Bausch & Lomb, down 4¼ to 147⅛, and Walt Disney Productions, off 4⅜ to 103¾. Squibb dropped 3 points to 74¼ after filing a registration statement for the proposed sale of 583,000 shares. This repre sents holdings of two former stockholders of Lanvin‐Charles of the Ritz, Inc., who received Squibb shares after a merger last April. All of the 15 most active issues displayed losses. The volume leader was Airco, for merly Air Reduction, which slipped 1¼ to 16⅜. It was one of the session's 138 lows, com pared with only six highs. Pittston, dropping 4⅝ to 33½, represented the biggest point loss among the active is sues. It was also the exchange's largest percentage loser. The decline in Pittston followed a downward revision of estimated 1971 profits by man agement, reflecting the impact of the current coal strike. American Telephone and Telegraph eased ¼ to 42⅛ in brisk trading. Earlier, it sold as low as 42, thus equaling its poorest price of the year. At this level, shares of A. T. & T. carry a yield of 6.2 per cent. Among reasons for the mar ket decline—the 12th setback in the last 14 sessions—numer ous Wall Streeters cited an interview that appeared in yes terday's editions of The New York Times. In this question and‐answer piece, Eliot Jane way declared: “I see the Dow getting down to 500 in 1972 as a test level.” Many investors, both profes sional and amateur, took ex ception with the views of Mr. Janeway, a 58‐year‐old political economist. “This guy scares people,” stated the head of one large brokerage house. Stocks with the largest per centage gains on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday: Stocks with the largest per centage drops on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday: A continuing source of con cern, analysts stated, was un certainty over the implementa tion of Phase Two of President Nixon's economic stabilization program, slated to begin on Nov. 14. The market's biggest point gainers were the Mission Cor poration, soaring 15¾ to 117¼, and Skelly Oil, rising 3½ to 44½ on an ex‐dividend basis, They also ranked as the best percentage gainers among all Big Board issues. Directors of Getty Oil au thorized that company to make an offer of $120 a share for 100,000 shares of Mission com mon. Mission, a key unit of the Getty group of companies, holds a controlling interest in Skelly as its chief asset. Several airline stocks, moved downward in response to vari ous developments. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines fell 21¼ to 30⅝, following the dividend omis sion and lower earnings re ported on Friday. Trans World Airlines dropped 2⅛ to 34¾, while Pan Ameri can World Airways declined 1¼ to 10¾. This followed re ports that airlines flying Atlan tic routes so far have failed to work out an agreement that would prevent open, or compet itive, fares from taking effect on Feb. 1. The New York Times com bined average slumped 9.30 points to 498.76. Yesterday's break was the sharpest since the decline of 13.73 points on Aug. 18, when stock prices retreated in a tech nical pullback following the euphoria of the Nixon rally. In the two previous sessions of Aug. 16 and Aug. 17, the blue chip Dow indicator skyrocketed a total of 43.88 points. All but a handful of the Dow industrials moved down yester day in another of Wall Street's Blue Mondays. Du Pont toppled 3⅜ to 144⅜. General Motors dropped 1¼ to 76⅝. Declining more than a point apiece were General Electric, Eastman Ko dak, Johns‐Manville and Sears, Roebuck. The list of yearly lows Was sprinkled with golds, commer cial banks, steels, oils, alumi nums, retailers, closed‐end in vestment companies and super market stocks.

To the Editor: Now that women tennis players have liberated themselves, I believe doubles players of both sexes should unite in support of United States open doubles championships prior to the singles tournament and at a different site. The spectacle of an anticlimactic men's doubles final completed in near‐darkness with an unfair, and possibly illegal, scoring denouement (a tiebreaker replacing the fifth set) for a stingy $1,000 prize made a mockery of a traditionally prestigious event. Any settlement of the World Championship Tennis‐United States Lawn Tennis Association dispute must deal concretely with this subject. Springfield, Mass.

1363-> Poff's Decision May Mean Long Delay in Filling Court
WASHINGTON, Oct. 3—The Nixon Administration found itself back at the starting point today in its search for Supreme Court nominees in the wake of Representative Richard H. Poff's abrupt announcement yesterday that he had asked President Nixon not to appoint him. “No real consideration was being given to anyone else,” an official close to the situation said today. Representative Gerald R. Ford, the House Republican leader, said today that one reason for Mr. Poff's decision was his concern that opponents would attempt to filibuster until Congress adjourned, resulting in a long and perhaps acrimonious discussion of the Virginia Republican's record and personal qualifications. Mr. Ford agreed that “it would have been very easy for a filibuster to have been generated” because of the legislative schedule and indications that some Democrats were ready to use delaying tactics. The result of Mr. Poff's withdrawal is that the seven‐member Supreme Court will begin its 1971 term tomorrow facing the prospect of a much longer delay than was previously expected before its two vacant seats are filled. Shortly after the late Justice Hugo L. Black and former Justice John M. Harlan retired last month, the Court postponed scheduled arguments on a number of important cases, apparently expecting that the two vacancies would be filled early in the court term. However, the Nixon Administration was apparently so committed to Mr. Poff that it had not picked a fallback candidate for the Court's “Southern seat.” There has been no indication that Mr. Nixon will back away from his determination to place a Southerner on the Court, so both seats are likely to remain empty until he selects a candidate from the South who can win confirmation by the Senate. The prospect of further delay has prompted some speculation here that Mr. Nixon may shift his sights toward a more moderate Southerner. A common thread between Mr. Poff and Clement F. Haynsworth Jr. and G. Harrold Carswell, Mr. Nixon's two Southern nominees, who were rejected by the Senate, was a conservative record on civil rights issues as well as law‐and‐order questions. Some Democrats, elaborating on the arguments made by Mr. Ford, have begun to point out that if the President cannot get the Senate to approve his nominees before the end of the current session of Congress, an argument might be made for holding off any confirmation until after the 1972 Presidential election. A similar argument was made by Mr. Nixon and other Republicans when they blocked former President Johnson's effort to fill the seat that Chief Justice Earl Warren planned to vacate in June of 1968. The possibility that President Nixon might move toward the center with his next Southern nominee has brought forward the name of Federal District Judge Frank M. Johnson of Alabama, a Republican who is a moderate on civil rights but on the conservative side on criminal issues; and Charles Alan Wright, a law professor at the University of Texas. Another option open to the President is to pick a Southern judge who is conservative in his views but is obscure enough not to draw heavy fire from liberal forces. Sources here were unable to say what effect, if any, Mr. Poff's withdrawal might have on the prospects that the next seat might go to a woman. One source said that consideration was being given in the Administration to holding off nominations until the next session of Congress. The specific reasons for Mr. Poff's decision are still not known, beyond his statement that he wished to spare Congress and his family a “protracted and controversial” struggle. However, there was some feeling in legal circles that he could have been influenced by the likely possibility that the American Bar Association's Committee on the Federal Judiciary would give him a less, than‐enthusiastic rating. The committee was meeting in New York on his qualifications when his withdrawal was announced yesterday. Some of the members had expressed cooncern that he had practiced law for only four years before being elected to Congress. Under a new rating system, the bar association's committee was prepared to apply three categories — “not qualified,” “not opposed,” and “meets high standards of professional competence, judicial temperament and integrity.” Previously, the committee had used only qualified and highly qualified ratings, and it had never been willing to declare that a person named to the Supreme Court by the President was unqualified. This time, there appeared to be a real chance that Mr. Poff would get the “not opposed” rating. With liberal forces gearing up to attack his civil rights record, such an unenthusiastic rating would have seriously damaged his prospects for confirmation. Mr. Port had been at the point of accepting a nominationn to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit Court when Justice Black retired. It is not known whether Mr. Nixon will now nominate Mr. Poff for that seat. In any event, many of his friends believe that this will be Mr. Poff's last term in Congress. His district in southwest Virginia has been redistricted this year, and he is now ellgible to retire after 20 years in the House. Mr. Poff, who is 147 years old, has told friends that even if he does not go on the bench he will retire.

1364-> CHINA MITES FOR JAPANESE TIE
HONG KONG, Oct. 3—The Chinese Communists spelled out in considerable detail the kind of relationship they want with Japan in a joint communiqué signed yesterday in Peking with a visiting group of Japanese legislators. The text of the communiqué was received here today in Peking dispatch by Hsinhua, the Chinese Communist press agency. [The French Ambassador to Peking, Etienne Manach, traveling with a Chinese delegation visiting France, said in Tours: “Something has happened in China. I cannot tell you anything more,” The Associated Press reported.] On the Japanese side the statement was negotiated by a delegation of 19 that included six members of the ruling Liberal‐Democratic party of Premier Eisaku Sato. Others in the delegation were six members of the Socialist party, four members of the Komeito and three members of the Democratic‐Socialist party. The delegation was headed by Aiichiro Fujiyama, a LiberalDemocrat and former Foreign Minister. The statement agreed that relations should be established between Peking and Tokyo “at the earliest possible date” on the basis of Tokyo's dropping relations with the Chinese Nationalist Government on Taiwan and abrogating the peace treaty that has been signed between Japan and the Nationalists. The two sides agreed that Tokyo and Peking should negotiate a new peace treaty ending the state of war that Peking considers still exists from the time of the Chinese‐Japanese conflict that ended in 1945. In this connection there was no mention of war reparations, which Chinese leaders in the past have said constitute a basic Peking claim against Japan of billions of dollars. The joint statement significantly also contained no mention of the United States‐Japan defense treaty, which the Chinese have denounced on previous occasions. The statement did say, however, that the superpowers “must withdraw their forces stationed in foregin countries and dismantle their military bases abroad.” It specifically stated that “the United States must withdraw its armed forces and military installations from Indochina and other areas in the Far East.” A neutral Japan was indicated as the aim of the two sides. This was referred to in a paragraph that expressed the hope that the Japanese people would be able to establish an “independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral and prosperous Japan.” The statement said there is only one China and that the Peking Government is the sole legal government of the one China that includes Taiwan as an inalienable part of its territory. The statement opposed any such concepts as two Chinas; one China, one Taiwan; one China, two Governments, or that the “title of Taiwan remains unsettled.” The Taiwan question was declared to be China's internal affair that “brooks no interference by any foreign country.” It was said to be imperative to restore “all lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in all the organs of the United Nations, including the seat in the Security Council as a permanent member and expel the representatives of the Chiang Kai‐shek clique from the United Nations.” The statement said the Japanese “deeply regret” that the Sato Cabinet had acted as a cosponsor for the two Americaninitiated resolutions now before the United Nations that call for seating Peking in the Security Council but keeping the Chinese Nationalist Government in the world body as a member of the General Assembly. The Japanese delegation concluded its visit to Peking last night and left today for home. The visit began Sept. 17. The meeting was part of the continuing effort of the Chinese to win support for a proPeking policy by Japan and to undermine support for Premier Sato. Premier Chou En‐lai has indicated that his Government would not deal with a government headed by Mr. Sato.

1365-> Volpe and Hartke in Clash Over Aid to Rail Industry
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16.—Transportation Secretary John A. Volpe and Senator Vance Hartke, Democrat of Indiana, broadened their personal feud today to include a fundamental dispute over relief for the nation's financially troubled railroad industry. The policy dispute, a critical test of the long effort among economists and consumers to ease regulations of freight rates, unfolded in a hearing from which Republican Senators had barred television cameras. They said they were taking the step to save Mr. Volpe from being “kicked around and insulted” by Mr. Hartke on nationwide news broadcasts. Acrimonious political exchanges dominated much of the discussion. Last week Senator Hartke, chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, called for Secretary Volpe's resignation. This morning, he accused the Secretary of chronic lateness with his legislative reports and asked if he was “afraid” to have their arguments televised. Cotton Rebuffs Hartke Senator Norris Cotton of New Hampshire, the Senior Republican on the subcommittee, presented himself to Senator Hartke as “one man you can't walk on” and said it was he, not Secretary Volpe, who had moved to ban the television catneras. The root of the feud, as Senator Cotton hinted and Senator Hartke then confirmed, was Mr. Volpe's appearance in Indiana last fall on behalf of Senator Hartke's opponent. Senator Cotton declared, “I don't propose to see a Cabinet officer—in a Republican or in a Democratic Administration—brought up here and kicked around and insulted before television.” The freight regulation bill that Mr. Volpe presented before the subcommittee this morning stands in sharp contrast to legislation Senator Hartke has introduced on behalf of an alliance of truckers, railroads and barge operators. The main elements in the industry bill are a $5‐billion fund of Federal loans and guarantees for transport companies, a relaxation of the ceilings on freight rates, extension of regulation to the trucks that carry farm products, and a package of local and Federal tax relief. Mr. Volpe argued that, if the transport industry put its own house in order, it could obtain credit on its own. He said that changes in the regulatory process should be aimed at reductions, not increases. Regulation of agricultural shipments would only add to consumer food prices, he said. At the heart of Mr. Volpe's proposal is a mounting impatience with regulatory doctrine as enforced by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Rigid rates and the commission's ability to bar competitive rate reductions have often prevented the railroads from mar keting their natural economic advantages over trucks, Mr. Volpe said. At the same time, commission restrictions on the abandonment of lightly used branch tracks have saddled the railroads with 21,000 miles of trackage in areas that could better be served by trucks, he said. In place of fixed freight rates, the Volpe bill proposes a “zone of reasonableness” somewhere between actual costs and a 50 per cent markup over costs. By eliminating the many categories where railroads are now forced to carry, low‐rated commodities below cost, the bill would bring immediate savings of $480‐million to the industry—$80‐million for the Penn Central Railroad alone, he said. There seemed to be general agreement at the hearing that the Penn Central would need another direct Federal grant or loan before any of broad rate reforms can take effect.

1367-> Cockney Rhyming Slang Won't Take New Coins
LONDON, Feb. 15—Bobby Redrupp, a vegetable seller at a stall in Chapel Market, Islington, is a natural ex pert in the imaginative word play that is Cockney rhym ing slang. He calls the sixpence, among the most widely used British coins until decimal coinage took over today, “Torn Mix,” and one penny is a “currant bun.” Five shil lings, which used to be known as a dollar — their worth before the 1949 deval uation of the pound—is “an Oxford scholar.” Mr. Redrupp was rather down on decimals. “You can't even rhyme the word,” he said. “It doesn't fit decibels.” But Lord Fiske, chairman of the Decimal Currency Board, said today that he was sure slang terms would ap pear. “The British public is very good at this sort of thing,” he said.

1369-> Dartmouth Downs Holy Cross, 28‐9, by Capitalizing on Fumble Recoveries
HANOVER, N. H., Oct. 2—An alert Dartmouth defensive unit turned two fumbles into lategame touchdowns today in Memorial Stadium, and the Indians went on to a 28‐9 victory over Holy Cross. The Crusaders, upset victors over Harvard a week ago, came here with the same Idea, and held a 6‐0 lead at the end of the opening quarter. But the Crusaders, under a first‐year coach, Ed Doherty, just ran out of manpower in the late stages and succumbed to Dartmouth's unrelenting speed and alert play. The hitting was fierce between the two rivals, there were four turnovers in the first half, three in a wild first quarter, but none of the miscues led to any scoring. But in the third period Holy Cross was to give up the ball twice, and the Indians of Jake Crouthamel turned both errors into decisive scores. Dartmouth's Bob Soltess, the right linebacker, was the man who upset the Crusader momentum both times. He pounced on a completed pass from Colin Clapton to Rich Pelletier, who had control and then dropped the ball. The Indians, with Bill Pollock guiding the multiple offense, went 69 yards in 5 plays with Pollock capping the drive on a 1‐yard scoring plunge. Ted Perry kicked the second of his four, successful conversions to give Dartmouth a 14‐9 lead. Jim McClowry had booted a 24‐yard field goal midway through the period to put Holy Cross ahead for the second time in the game. Dartmouth's go‐ahead touchdown came at 14:33. Soltess then became Johnny ‐ on ‐ the spot almost as soon as the teams had changed goals for the final period. Clapton fumbled and Soltess recovered the ball on the 30. Pollock took the Indians across in 3 plays, the scoring play a 26‐yard Pollock to Chuck Thomas pass at 1:30. The Crusaders refused to yield, and midway through the period Dan Harter, the middle linebacker, picked off a Steve Stetson pass and ran the ball 33 yards to the Dartmouth 20. The Crusaders, hammering at the Dartmouth middle on the furious plunging of Eddie Jenkins, Mark Monte and Joe Wilson reached the 4, but a four‐down pass misfired. Dartmouth took over and went 96 yards in 8 plays. Steve Webster took the Indians to the 50 on a 46‐yard burst. Then Brendan O'Neill picked up 18 more yards. Pollock hit Gregg Brown for 12 more. Pollock, on a keeper, rolled to the 5, and Klupchak went off right tackle for his second touchdown, Dartmouth's final points. Dartmouth, winning its 11th straight game over two seasons, ran off 82 plays to 61 for Holy Cross. The Indian offense was not that polished, however. There were several broken plays, but Pollock managed to turn most of them into successful yardage by finding an uncovered receiver. Holy Cross proved often too stubborn for Dartmouth to run through the middle, but Pollock was excellent on the pitchouts. The Indians got 95 yards from Chuplak on 11 carries, 57 from Webster on 5, 46 from O'Neill on 12 and 36 from Doug Lind on 8. Pollock also completed 9 of 18 passes for 182 yards and one touchdown. Harter, who left the game late, was a one‐man defensive unit. He tackled Indian runners 18 times and made one interception. Jenkins, a burly, slashing halfback, gained 68 yards on 19 carries, and his equally burly running mate, Wilson, the fullback, slammed out 44 yards on 15 attempts. Pelletier caught passes for 62 yards, but Brown snared 3 for 43 and Tyrone Byrd caught 3 for 33, while Sam Watkins picked up 63 yards on tine catch that set up Dartmouth's second touchdown. ??

1373-> Art
“PERHAPS at no time since World War II has the imminent on set of a New York art season presented as joy less and uncertain a prospect as it does this year. In place of the usual mood of anxious optimism, an aura of cynicism, truculence and gloom per vades the local art world, which, though traditionally a somewhat hysterical milieu, has rarely appeared so thor oughly disorganized and dis enchanted. Two obvious caus es of this malaise are the ex pectation of unprecedented political militance on the part of artists and the shaky state of the economy. “But the trouble goes deep er, seeming less a momentary crisis in fact than a general crisis of confidence, an attack of bad conscience, a sense of having been cast adrift. …” That was how, 11 months ago in these pages, I began an article—“Is the Art World Heading for a Nervous Break down?” In it, I went on to cite a number of symptoms—the virulent politicalization of young artists following Kent State and Cambodia, the rise of presumably “unsalable” (and hence subversive to “the system”) Conceptual and Anti‐Formal art, the meretri ciousness of heralded new developments in painting, and the shabby supermarket eth ics and ambience of new trends in gallery management —from which I derived a pes simistic prognosis for what appeared to me a very sick patient. A cursory check of the situation now, nearly a year later, would seem to in dicate that I was wrong. * Despite my dark forecast, the 1970‐71 season passed in an atmosphere almost of calm, and the art world, while scarcely robust, may be said to be resting comfort ably. Political furors did oc cur—over representation of women in the Whitney An nual, over a show of black art also at the (hapless) Whit ney, over Government cen sorship of a private show of art using the American flag, and Guggenheim Museum censorship of a projected show by Hans Haacke of “so cial systems” Conceptual works—but these were taken more or less in stride, and nothing like mass disaffec tion among young artists seemed in the offing. The more offensive of the new galleries, meanwhile, came to seem a little less offensive, if only because now and then they showed good art, and the best older galleries, while plainly in a financial bind, showed no signs of folding or of abandoning their probity. As for the putative new movements in painting I had decried, one—photo‐slavish “New Super Realism”—looks as trashy as ever, but the oth er—so‐called “Lyrical Ab straction”—proved to be har boring under its misleading banner a variety of excellent and genuinely original young talents. And as for Conceptu al and Anti‐Formal art, they continued to develop along ever wackier, more abstruse, sometimes entertaining and sometimes stupefying lines (the latest stage of Conceptu alism, something called “Body Art,” is all of these things) without precisely shaking the Establishment to its founda tions. But more of them later. * Obviously, my predictions of apocalypse were much mistaken; it seems to me now that, like others at the time, I was reacting more to the intensity than to the real con tent of what was going on and that, concentrating with disgust on symptoms of dec adence apparent in the situa tion, I missed concurrent signs of healthiness, of a new sobriety and sense of re newal, which today strike me as much more significant than all the lingering follies and corruptions to which our art scene seems eternally heir. For real changes have become evident during the past year in the mood and mentality of American art, subtle changes of attitude and sensibility difficult at this point to account for but whose force and nature are gradually becoming clear and which I propose to investigate briefly. What the “crisis” of a year ago demonstrated was the futility of a system of esthet ic and economic rationality— the euphoric art world of the 1960's, in which the “packag ing” (in Harold Rosenberg's phrase) of artworks came to seem a natural corollary of their creation—in collision with new (or newly rediscov ered) realities both in the artist's studio and in the cul ture at large. The most im portant of these realities is that of art‐making itself, of the mysterious subjective process by which esthetic de cisions are made and which in the last decade was often (and approvingly) spoken of as if it resembled that of an automotive assembly line. A related fact was the unstated assumption by those enter taining such quasi‐mechanis tic views of art production that the industry charged with disseminating its prod uct (because it was “art,” after all) had somehow a priv ileged social' position, immune to stresses affecting other sectors of the economy. But the rash of politicking and of “non‐commercial” art that so upset the system— which could respond only by lamely trumpeting still other “new movements” (where there were in fact none to speak of) and by further vul garizing its merchandising techniques while clucking rit ual pieties of social concern —were by no means the rev olutionary phenomena they were claimed to be. Rather, they were just extensions of the old rational, ever‐onwards “modernist” mythology on which the system was based and which, even as they re vealed gaping contradictions in the system, appeared to legitimize them. * Anti‐Formalism, for all its occasional spunkiness, de pends for its life on attitudes underlying the criticism and marketing of formalist geo metric and color‐field paint ings, and Conceptual Art gains both its charm and its ultimate triviality from being the redacto ad absurdum of avant‐gardist theories previ ously applied with price‐hik ing enthusiasm to the outputs of Pop and Minimal. What is happening in a positive sense as a result of all this is. If you will, that the art world is being made responsible more to the vari ous nature of art currently being created and less to its own thirst for packageable novelty and, even more heart ening, that the American art work itself is, by some cu rious process, recovering its strangeness. No longer so sheltered—as a kind of hot house esthetic horticulturist laboring to produce record breaking begonias for next year's garden show—the art ist is being exposed anew to the hard but bracing fact of uncertainty, forced to re establish contact with mo tives for Making art that are personal rather than collec tive, present rather than his torical. And if, after the gush ing excitements of the sixties, we are in for a period which seems arid by comparison, it may at least prove to have a climate in which a free and creative mind can breathe.

1374-> M.T.A. Agrees to Station At 96th St. on 2d Ave. Line
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced yesterday that a station would be built at 96th Street for the new Second Avenue subway system. Dr. William J. Ronan, chairman of the authority, said the decision was the result of a public hearing on Sept. 15 at Hunter College. At the session, residents of the area, headed by representatives of institutions, presented demands that Dr. Ronan said “demonstrated a persuasively genuine need” for such a station on the line, which is scheduled to be in operation by 1978. He said his agency was impressed, for one thing, by testimony that greater use would be made of the 96th Street crosstown bus that runs through a Central Park transverse road. In spelling out the demands for such a station, William J. Diamond, chairman of Community Planning Board 8, cited the expanding development of the Metropolitan Hospital Center between 97th and 99th Streets and First and Second Avenues. He said that the center employed nearly 4,000 people, had 1,000 visitors each weekday and 4,000 every Saturday and Sunday. Further, Mr. Diamond said that the proposed station would serve the Ruppert Brewery Urban Renewal Area that will ultimately house 8,000 people, and the Park East High School now under construction at 94th Street and Second Avenue, with an expected enrollment of 4,000 students. Reached by telephone last night, Mr. Diamond, a lawyer, said he was “overjoyed.” His community board, which has advisory powers, represents 400,000 tipper East Side residents. The 96th Street station will be included on Route 132‐A, which will run under Second Avenue between 34th Street and East 126th Street. Dr. Ronan said that detailed planning for it would be undertaken by the staff of the Transit Authority, which operates under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The estimated cost of Route 132‐A is $371‐million, a figure that does not include the cost of engineering, subway cars and the additional, undisclosed cost of the 96th Street station. Route 132‐A will include a train interconnection under East 63d Street and Second Avenue with a new line between Queens and Manhattan. Construction of the new Queens line has begun. Ultimately, Route 132‐A will be connected at 126th Street with another route, 132‐B extending beneath the Harlem River into the Bronx to join the existing Pelham Bay Park and Dyre Avenue lines. Route 132‐A will also be connected at 34th Street to a third new route, 132‐C, extending to the southern tip of Manhattan at Whitehall Street. It will provide a connection to Brooklyn and to a route planned for the Lower East Side.

1376-> Bus Strike Curbs Service To 3 Major Airports Here
Bus service between midtown and the three major metropoli tan area airports was sharply reduced yesterday as drivers for Carey Transportation Com pany stopped work to protest new winter schedules that laid off 42 out of a total of 245 drivers. Under an order obtained by the company yesterday after noon, the union, Local 1898 of the United Transportation Union, has been directed to ap pear in Brooklyn Federal Court at 10 A.M. today to show why its members should not be made to return to work. Passengers arriving at mid town airport terminals, lugging heavy suitcases and anxiously looking at their watches, gen erally took the inconvenience without complaint as dispatch ers urged them to double up in taxis to go out to the air ports. Businessmen with attaché cases arriving at the airports were also directed into taxis by twos and threes and some times reminded that it was il legal for drivers to charge more than the fee on the meter. In anticipation of possible overcharging by taxidrivers, the Taki Commission sent four inspectors to Kennedy Interna tional Airport and two to La Guardia to assist the policemen who are regularly assigned to the airports to watch for vio lations. A spokesman for the Port of New York Authority said that no unusual problems had been found, although several sum monses were given to drivers attempting to charge a group fee or for trying to determine where passengers were headed before allowing them to get into the taxi. A group fee is higher than the meter fare but costs each member of the group less than he would pay if he paid the regular meter fare by himself. The new winter schedules were presented to the drivers last week. There are fewer runs on these schedules than on the summer schedules, when air port traffic is heavier. The cut back in runs has resulted in dropping 42 men with the low est seniority. Their jobs will be offered back to them next spring, according to William A. Sanders, executive vice presi dent of Carey. Although Mr. Sanders said that this was in accordance with the, contract between the company and the union, Vito Ancona, chairman and business agent for Local 1898 of the United Transportation Union called the company's action “out of order.” Mr. Ancona said that the drivers would continue to report under the summer schedule. As a result of yesterday's ac tion, nearly all the 150‐sched uled round trips between La Guardia and the East Side terminal were canceled; 25 trips were made to Kennedy Airport and 150 were canceled, and nearly all 55 round trips to Newark Airport were canceled. From January until August of this year, more than 25 mil lion passengers came through the three airports and Carey transported 3,086,000 of them, according to Port Authority fig ures. Mr. Sanders said Carey would normally have trans ported about 10,000 passengers yesterday. He said he was Unable to say how many ac tually had been carried. Passengers can get to the air ports by using regular bus and subway lines. To get to Kennedy Interna tional Airport from midtown (which costs $2.50 from the East Side Terminal by Carey bus and about $11 by taxi, ac cording to a spokesman for the taxi industry), riders can take an E train from Eighth Avenue and 42d Street or an F train from Sixth Avenue and 42d Street to Union Turnpike‐Kew Gardens (26 minutes). From there, they can take a Q‐10 bus on the Green Bus Line to the airport (32 minutes). Buses run every 10 minutes, except be tween 1 A.M. and 5 A.M., when they run every half hour. To get to La Guardia (which costs $2 by Carey from the East Side Terminal and $5.50 to $6 by taxi), the rider can take an E train from Eighth Avenue and 42d Street or an F train from Sixth Avenue and 42d Street to Roosevelt Ave nue, Jackson Heights, Queens (about 17 minutes). Then he takes a Q‐33 bus on the Tri borough Coach line to the air port (about 18 minutes). These leave every 10 minutes until 11 P.M. It is possible to get to La Guardia by taking the No. 7 train on the Flushing line at Grand Central Terminal to Roose velt Avenue (20 minutes) and a Q‐33 bus from there (18 min utes). A taxi to, Newark costs about $21, because the driver is allowed to charge for a round trip or twice what shows on the meter. However, a num ber of buses leave from the Port Authority Terminal at Eighth Avenue and 41st Street and go directly to the airport.

If they can sell their performers to the highest bidders, ‘and black out home television for the poor folk why not the same grab for the pro football Super Bowl, the World Series and all other big sports and theatrical productions? Congress and the Supreme Court have had trouble with the regulation of professional sports ever since the days of “Kenesww Mountain” Landis, and have bent the antitrust laws to protect the semimonopoly structure of professional football and baseball, but now they have a new problem to think over. The courts and the Congress havebeen comparatively lenient with the pro football and baseball promoters on the ground that they were not merely a business but a sporting enterprise, where the rights of the player to sell his services to the highest bidder had to be restricted and the rights of the club owners to black out local television areas when the team was playing at home should be protected. But in the Frazier‐Ali fight, the promoters demanded and got unrestricted rights to sell their product at prices ranging from ‘$150 for a seat in Madison Square Garden to $15‐$30 for closed television seats in theaters and hotels all over the country. Thus, total proceeds not counting movie and free television re‐runs, amounted to about $20 million—$17 million from the closed‐circuit gate receipts and $3 million from the rest. The promoters not only kept the fight off the television and radio networks of the United States and Can ada, but even tried by legal action to restrict the right of news agencies to file blow‐by‐blow accounts of the fight to their newspaper, radio and television clients. In fad, when the official's of COMSAT, which was sending the pictures of the fight overseas by satellite, tried to invite a few friends into their office to see the picture, Jack Kent Cooke, one of the two promoters of the fight, gave his permission only on condition that they also invite the Federal CommUnications’ Commissioners and the members of the two‐Congressional Commerce Committees, regulate broadcasting, to attend the showing as his persbnal guests. Okay, so it was a business bonania, and maybe all legal too, but professional sport is to be judged solely as a bushiest; using interstate commerce facilities and selling tickets In interstate commerce, then it cart be argued that it ‘should hencefOrth ‘be subject to Federal Interstate commerce regulation in the public interest. Anybody who saw the crowds of blacks around Madison Square Garden in NeW York; ‘rand around the Hilton Hotel in Wathington, Where the closed.circuit seats were selling at $10 piece, could even believe’ that there is a question of public aafety involved in this monopoly. This time it at a case of “let the buyer bewate,” but next time, if there is a re‐match under the stuns highpriced closed‐circuit setup, the security problem for the promotersand their well‐heeled guests, may be formidable indeed. Even the networks with their highpriced advertising Cannot hope to compete with the closed‐circuit, receipts from spectacular events like: a heavyWeight championship flight or a pro football Super Bowl game. The pro football leagues collected $2.5 million for. the television, rights to the last Super Bowl in Miami But, a circuit network in theaters in all the pro football cities might easily bring in ten time's that much, and the only people left out again would be the ,poor. It may be, of course, that pay‐asyon‐see television is the coming thing, and there are somocritics who believe that it will eventually increase the variety and quality of Ainerican television programs. Thus, is argued that ‘by transferring the tcost of prograins from the advertiser to the viewer, enough people may be willing to ‘pay to ‘see a good play or ‘concert to’ make It profitable for national distribution. But the dangers of high ‐priced closed‐circult sporting spectaculars are fairly obvious. Sport in America’ gains its power from mass audiences; and what ‘the closed: circuit system does is to increase the revenues While, reducing the number of people who can afford to see the event. In fact, not since tha invention of television has any championship fight in America taken in fib Mitch money or been Seen by so few PeOple in this country as the Fraziet‐All battle. It Is time that heavyweight championship fights are regarded’ by the courts as monopolyy enterprisea, but it was never anticipated that ‘they would be governed by the predatory practices that Controlled this one. One argument for professional sport in Aniericit. is that it occasionally diverts the whole nation from its normal preoccupations and provides the people with a common interest for at least a few hours. The closed‐circuit system, threatens to change, all that: It is sport for the rich, like polo and yacht racing, with the poor outside the gate. And since the poor outnumber and ‘Outvote the tich, the possibilities of fair legislation to avoid the repetition or spread of the practice are fairly obvious.

TRENTON, July 7—As a favor to a state trooper friend, an assistant counsel to Gov. William T. Cahill agreed to take part in a po lice line‐up today. A woman bank teller had told the police that she could identify a man suspected of stealing and cashing state employes' pay checks. The counsel, Richard Wein roth, stood before the tel ler, along with an aide to Attorney General George Kugler Jr., a newspaperman, a mail‐room employee and the real suspect. After Mr. Weinroth had re turned to his desk in the Governor's office, he was told the teller had picked him as the culprit. “I guess,” Mr. Weinroth said, “I didn't help their case much.”

CATANIA, Sicily, May 16 (AP)—Villagers in two Mount Etna towns, Fornazzo and Sant’ Alfio, prayed in their churches but stood their ground tonight as flaming lava from the volcano advanced toward their homes. The lava stream, 300 feet wide and 12 feet high, moved forward slowly a few miles away.

1383-> A Peaceful Place With Memories
JALAPA, Mexico—The contrast is striking: Mount Orizaba, with its silvery cap of snow 18,851 feet high, dominating the horizon 40 miles to the southwest; tropical Jalapa, embowered in gardenias, oleander, crepe myrtle and trumpet vine, and, nearby, the Mexican War battlefield of Cerro Gordo, where American soldiers are supposed to have played ball using Gen. Santa Ana's wooden leg as a bat. Jalapa, which is about 200 miles east of Mexico City, has homes that blend Spanish and Moorish architecture, overhanging balconies laden with flowers, hills as steep as those in San Francisco and roads as twisty as those in Naples. Some of Mexico's best tobacco is raised in the area around the city, and it is good base for touring surrounding areas —including those Mexican War battlefields. Ethnologist's Treasury The city lies on Mexico Route 140, 75 miles northwest of Veracruz, and it is the capital of the state of Veracruz. It has a population of 120,000, but it was thriving when Cortez marched through. Today, the d.,,,,..dants of the original inhabitants seem little influenced by modern life as they trot through the streets carrying fresh farm produce or hand‐made things such as tortoise‐shell combs, wooden toys, embroideries and candles. An ethnologist would find much to interest him in these sturdy remnants of some of the oldest tribes of Mexico, the Olmec and Toltenec Indians, and in the results of centuries of racial mingling between them and the French and Spaniards. The best view of Jalapa Is from the parapet of Juarez Park in front of the Governor's Palace. From this vantage point one can look out over the roofs of red Spanish tile and the orange trees that abound around the plaza. Many of the homes are relics of viceregal days, with massive walls and windows level with the pavement and protected by heavy iron bars. In early morning the narrow, cobblestone streets are thronged with burros bearing fruit and flowers to market. Before the Tour Before setting out on a tour of the surrounding country, visit a cigar factory here and watch the workers roll cigars, or puros. The cigars are milder than Havana brands; and they have fine flavor and burn evenly. The cigar band is said to have been invented here: paper bands were placed around the cigars so that women who smoked them would not stain their fingers. A day's tour along the so‐called “circle route” around Jalapa—through the towns of Perote, Coatepec, Hustusco, Las Trancas, Cerro Gordo and Vesta de Lencerno — takes in coffee, tangerine, sarsaparilla, banana and vanilla plantations, as well as tobacco. The route is through foothills, ravines, tablelands and emerald valleys. Jardin Lecuona, In the village of Banderia, five miles from Jalapa, has spectacular display of passiflores. Eight miles from Jalapa is Coatepec, a picturesque, thatched roof Indian pueblo with a flower‐bedecked plaza. Orchid hunters the world over visit Invernados Maria Christina, a big greenhouse, whose owner, Jose Gomez, raises some 400 varieties or orchids. Indian Village Cerro Gordo, about 15 miles out of Jalapa, is an Indian village of 100 native huts. It is identified only by a small, plain highway marker. Here American troops routed Santa Ana's entrenched Mexican forces and opened the way for the march to the “Halts of Montezuma,” in 1847. Perhaps out of tact, the brochures put out by the Mexican or American travel agencies do not even mention Cerro Gordo. The roster of American officers who fought in the battle sounds like a roll call of Civil War greats on both sides. In it were such future Confederate generals as Lee, Beauregard, Ewell, Johnson, Early, Jackson and Hill. Fighting side by side with them were the embryo Yankee commanders—Grant, Hooker, McClellan, McDowell and Pope. Lee was cited for gallantry under fire and breveted a major for a daring reconnaisance in this battle. From the roadside marker you can look up at Cerro Gordo Hill, the precipitous sides of which blue‐clad Yankees scaled to rout Santa Ana, who left on the field many dead, 4,000 to be taken prisoner and also, humiliatingly, his spare wooden leg. Our knowledgeable guide was reluctant to discuss the battle. “It happened long time ago,” he shrugged. But later, in Jalapa, he pointed out the small plaza where United States troops, a few days after Cerro Gordo, allegedly played bat ball with Santa Ma's spare kg. Lee was impressed with Jalapa's scenery. He wrote his wife Mary from here: “I can conceive of nothing more beautiful in the way of flowers, landscape and mountain scenery.” Grant, then only a second lieutenant and not long out of West Point, wrote his fiancé, Julia, in St. Louis: “Jalapa is decidedly the most beautiful place ever saw in my life. It is never too hot or cold. The climate is said to be the world's best and from what I saw would be willing to make Jalapa my home for life, on one condition—that should be permitted to bring my darling Julie along.” Not One Ugly Face George McClellan, a fledgling shavetail lieutenant at the time, was noticing other things. To friends he wrote he had never seen so many pretty girls. “I couldn't find an ugly face,” he stated. “These girls’ faces can't be beat for pleasantness. Their eyes are mostly hazel and brilliantly black, fringed with long eyelashes. On top of this as we entered Jalapa the fragrance of orange blossoms floated out to meet us.” Regarding women and flowers, as recently observed them, Jalapa is much the same today as it was 114 years ago. Tourist accommodations probably haven't changed too much, either. There are only “satisfactory” hotels; they are priced at $6.50 to $9 double. Throughout Mexico, the war of 184648 between the two now friendly nations is little publicized. Printed reference to it is rare. The fact that Mexico lost almost half of its territory, including California, is not stressed in Mexico's schools today. Indeed, one MQdcan textbook I read describes Texas's earlier fight for independence from Mexico thusly: “The Texas rebels were people with traditions far different from ours. They lacked close contact with the rest of Mexico. They felt disunited from our country.” ‘Despotic Dictatorship’ This historian saved his sharp words for Santa Ana, the Mexican President and army leader at the time of both the Texas rebellion and the later war with the United States. Santa Ana's Government, he said, “was a despotic dictatorship.” In only one place in Mexico have seen an acrimonious reference to the war. In front of a small federal building in Tlacotalpan, along the banks of the muddy Papaloapan River in the southern part of Veracruz state, stands small popgun cannon mounted on wheels, with the inscription: “This cannon was fired in defense of the Republic during the invasion of the hated North Americans.” Mexico fought well enough in this war, even in defeat. And it had its heroes, including General Anaya, who surrendered the Churubusco Convent near Mexico City. Asked by an American officer where his ammunition was, the general replied with laconic words that ring like a bell in every patriotic Mexican's heart: “Sir, if there was any ammunition left, you would not be here.”

1384-> 4 Democratic Contenders Raise Curtainin Wisconsin
MILWAUKEE, May 16—Four of the leading contenders for the Presidential nomination were paraded last night before Wisconsin Democrats. Aside from minute variations in their personal styles, Senators Edmund S. Muskie, Harold E. Hughes, Birch Bayh, and George S. McGovern offered party regulars little on which to base an early choice. But their joint appearance at the $100‐a‐plate Jefferson‐Jackson Day dinner brought out more than 2,000 persons, one of the largest crowds in the Wisconsin party's restless history. It also raised the curtain on what promises to be the longest Presidential primary campaign in this state's memory. Each contender was allotted 15 minutes. The order in which they spoke was decided by lot. Of the four, only Senator McGovern is an announced candidate. None Hit Hard at Nixon Although each has said on previous occasions that President Nixon's conduct of the economy left him wide open to attack, none of them struck hard at him directly or did much more last night than allude to his Administration. Instead each made rambling, evangelical calls for an end to the nation's divisiveness and prejudice. The only consistent responses any of them drew from the chattering, restive audience in the cavernous Milwaukee Expo building came in response to demands for an end to the war in Vietnam. At an earlier televised news conference, which Senators McGovern and Hughes missed, both Senator Muskie and Senator Bayh said that if they were in the White House today they would try immediately to establish voluntary wage and price restraints. But if this failed, they said they would impose controls on labor and industry as the only means left to check inflation and reduce unemployment. Senator Bayh stated unequivocally that he would withdraw all Americans, even advisers, from South Vietnam. “I would also forbid any American Air Force or Naval units left afterward in Thailand or at sea to bomb in support of the South Vietnamese. We've done all we could be expected to do already, and this would be totally inconsistent with sound policy of withdrawal,” he declared. Senator Muskie was less positive. “The question of our troops in Thailand is a separate one that needs further consideration,” he said. “We must have a period of transition. But the really important thing is that we take the initiative now in setting a withdrawal date.” The four Democrats were invited to speak at the Wisconsin dinner because they appeared, at invitation tame, to be the most active contenders, Gov. Patrick J. Lucey, who presided at the dinner, explained yesterday. The Governor, who was in the past an active worker for both John and Robert Kennedy, said he had accepted Senator Edward M. Kennedy's insistence that he was not a candidate for President and therefore had not invited him. He said Senator Hubert H. Humphrey had also said that he would not campaign for the nomination and ,thus he had not been invited, either. Wisconsin's April 4 Presidential preference primary, in which voters will select 76 delegates pledged to the winner is nearly a year away. But Senators Bayh and McGovern have already toured the state this winter. Senator McGovern has already established a Wisconsin organization, staffed largely by former supporters of Eugene McCarthy. Senator Muskie appeared Friday night in South Milwaukee's large Polish‐American neighborhoods and attended luncheon yesterday with the state's powerful labor leaders, who could be the most important factor in deciding next April's winner. Today he was touring upstate before returning to Washington, D. C.

1386-> Eroding the Tax Base
Despite the probability of a challenge in the courts, the United States Treasury is putting into effect its liberal ized tax depreciation rules, retroactive to Jan. 1. The Treasury has sought to buttress its new rules against legal challenge by linking the useful lives of plant and equipment as claimed for depreciation purposes to the actual lives of such assets. Meanwhile, the cost of the depreciation speed‐up has been boosted; the Treasury now estimates that the rev enue loss will amount to $39 billion in the next decade. So huge a tax cut to business should have been deter mined by Congress after a full examination of its costs and benefits in relation to the nation's urgent and grow ing need for funds. In the years ahead, as both the President's annual economic report and the Brookings Institution review of the 1972 budget have shown, the country is going to be strapped for funds to meet expanding social needs. Through the first half of the 1970's, Federal expenditures already in the budget will increase as fast as full employment revenues, even assuming an end of the Vietnam war. No scope will be left for new programs unless taxes are raised. In the circumstances it is irresponsible for Congress to permit a tax cut of nearly $4 billion a year—a 5.8 per cent reduction in business taxes—to be instituted without full debate on Capitol Hill. In the absence of such open discussion and decision by Congress, public interest groups are now seeking to sue the United States Treasury as a means of blocking this huge surrender of public resources. The court test is likely to turn on the legality of so huge a tax cut by administrative action—and on the right of public interest groups to sue the Treasury. Both are important issues. But the even more crucial issue is that of allocating funds to meet the nation's social priorities—an issue that only Congress, not the courts, can resolve.

1388-> Britain's Retreat From the Gulf
Sir Alec Douglas‐Home has dressed British policy for the Persian Gulf in the most attractive clothes available but the import of his message cannot be camouflaged: Britain will terminate its protective treaties with nine Gulf states and withdraw its operational forces from that strategic area by the end of this year. Thus has a Tory Government reluctantly adopted the policy laid down 1968 by its Labor predecessor: The Tories had bitterly attacked the Labor Government's policy in 1968 and had charged in their 1970 election platform that the decision to withdraw would expose Britain and its friends to “unacceptable risks” the Gulf. Those risks are real enough. Britain's policy—carrying the hope for an enduring British influence—depends on many assumptions, some of them extremely dubious. Ideally, the nine Gulf states—ranging in population from 3,700 to 210,000, and in natural resources from desert sand to great oil reserves—will now join together in a Union of Arab Emirates. Britain will offer the Union a treaty of friendship carrying the undertaking “to consult together in time of need.” It will turn over a force known as the Trucial Oman Scouts as a nucleus for a Union army, making British officers and arms available. If desired, Britain will also provide training missions indefinitely and arrange regular exercises involving British Army and Air Force units together with visits by the Royal Navy. The trouble with all this is that the Union is not much closer to being a viable entity today than it was after Gulf rulers took their initial steps to form it under the shock of Britain's withdrawal notice in 1968. The two largest units—Bahrain, with one of the world's largest oil refineries, and Qatar, with 100,000 people and a daily oil output of 370,000 barrels—are reluctant to link up with the seven smaller Trucial states. Britain's loosening grip on an area for which it has shouldered responsibility for 150 years has already allowed a restoking of old tribal and territorial disputes. From the outside, Iran and Saudi Arabia have historical claims, though Iran last year gave up its demands on Bahrain. The Soviet fleet has been active in the Gulf as well as farther south in the Indian Ocean. Yet Britain had no alternative to maintaining'’ its withdrawal timetable. Iran and Saudi Arabia would have objected strenuously to any change of plan. Arab nationalism is strong enough to insure that even those Gulf rulers who want Britain to remain are reluctant to say so publicly. The Tory Government's decision represents a sensible acknowledgment of the end of an era—and the recognition that others must share the responsibilities for the problems that may follow British withdrawal.

1390-> Cosmos to Play Bangu In Soccer Here Friday
The New York Cosmos who are seeking their first victory against the other two expan sion teams in the North Amer ican Soccer League, will meet Bangu of Brazil Friday night at Yankee Stadium at 8 o'clock. Bangu, the fourth and last foreign side to play the Cosmos in matches that count in the league standing, will give the New Yorkers their last chance to also post a victory against a foreign team. Against the other foreign team, the Cosmos lost to Hearts of Scotland and Lanerossi of Italy, and tied Apolion of Greece. The Cosmos, however, scored six goals against the three and accumulated six bonus points which has helped them to hold second place in the Northern Division. The game with Bangu, which was scheduled to be played July 30 but was postponed because of rain, will mark the “Night of the Americas” at Yankee Stadium. A preliminary game will involve teams whose play ers come from Colombia and Ecuador. Special Peté Hall of Fame souvenirs will be given away. The Cosmos, who have done well against the established teams in the league and es pecially the Rochester Lancers, the defending champions, are looking forward to the Bangu game. Jorge Siege, however, the outside left, awaits the game more than any one else. He gained his spurs playing in his native Brazil, and this match means more to him than to the other Cosmos players. “It's the dream of every for eign player now playing in the United States to take the field against a team from his native country,” Siega said. “I'd love to send Bangu back home with the knowledge that soccer here has definitely im proved to the point where a team like ours can hold its own against foreign clubs,” Siega added. Although the Cosmos haven't done well against foreign op position, other teams in the league have posted impressive victories, especially Rochester victories, especially Rochester, Atlanta and Dallas. In all, league against the foreign visitors and lost 11.

1392-> Governor. Warns Cabinet To ‘Reef Sails’ on Budget
ALBANY, March 24 — In the midst of negotiating massive cuts in his proposed $8.45‐billion budget, Governor Rockefeller warned his cabinet today to “reef the sails and batten down the hatches.” The Governor told his department heads at a closed meeting in the Capitol that they should prepare for substantial reductions in their departmental budgets for the fiscal year starting April. The Rockefeller warning came after another negotiating session on budget cuts with the Legislature's Republican leaders, Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea of Montauk, L.I., and Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges of Niagara Falls. There was still no agreement on the size of the budget reduction, which is expected to range from $500‐million to $700‐million, and the three men scheduled still another session for tomorrow. Mr. Duryea met later with Republican Assemblymen, but gave no details of the negotiations. Instead he scheduled another conference for Friday morning and warned the legislators to plan on a long day in the Capitol. The Governor and the Republican leaders hope to reach an agreement and to persuade Republican legislators to support the budget by Friday so that the lengthy bills can be printed over the weekend and debated and voted on next week. With the deadline approaching, tensions and tempers rose with these developments: ¶Democratic leaders hi the Assembly raised the possibility of a walkout if the Republican majority tries to rain through the budget bills. Since the State Constitution requires that 60 per cent of the membership be present for budget and tax bill votes, such a move could halt action on the proposals. ¶Senator Thomas Laverne, Republican of Rochester and chairman of the Senate Education Committee, exploded in rage at a mass meeting of about 1,000 teachers, administrators and parents seeking additional state aid for schools. “They're talking about cutting $50‐million or so from the mental hygiene budget,” Mr. Laverne said, “and let me tell you that before I agree to cut one cent from mental health I'll take $50‐million from, education.” The remark touched off a roar of boos and catcalls and the Senator cried, “I'm fed up to the teeth with all of you,” and stalked out of the meeting in the State Education Building. ¶Leaders of a group pressing for school aid, including school board and teachers' union officials, said after separate meetings with the Governor and Republican legislative leaders that they had been told that there was no money available for additional state aid to schools. They said they had also been warned by the Governor of possible cuts in existing aid. And Assemblyman Milton Jonas, Republican of North Merrick, L. I., warned that be and several other Republican legislators would not vote for a budget that included cuts in welfare aid to dependent children.

1395-> The World
SAIGON — President Nguyen Van Thieu's real problems began last week after he solved one that has commanded priority for months over other affairs of war and state—how to hold an election that would ensure an overwhelming vote for his continuance in office. He solved that one by engineering for himself a dubioussounding 94.3 per cent vote of confidence in a supposedly massive turnout last Sunday in which he was the only candidate. The voting was disturbed by day‐long demonstrations and attacks by rioters on polling places in Danang, the second largest city, and was preceded by a day of tear gas and firebombs in Hue, the symbolically important imperial capital and university center of Vietnam. In these cities and everywhere else the powerful anti ‐ Govermnent An Quang faction of the Bilddhist church urged its millions of followers to boycott the election. An Quang now claims that many actually did—more, anyway, than the 12 per cent of the voters who the Government says stayed at home. Whatever really happened last Sunday, a general American viewpoint here IS that, as one diplomat put it, “It was a mess, and we might as well put it behind us.” It seems as though that is what the weary Vietnamese voters want to do, too. Scarcely a peep has been heard from the oppoiltion since last Sunday—not even from that most voluble and obstreperous of Mr. Thieu's opponents, Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, who the month before called repeatedly for Mr. Thieu's “destruction,” by violent means if necessary. The other pole figure of the opposition, Duong Van Minh, the retired general who like Mr. Ky refused to run in the elections because he thought President Thieu would rig them, has also remained silent during the past week. His supporters have been telling people that he believes that “any opposition to Mr. Thieu merely embellishes his regime.” With the anti ‐ Government forces in a momentarily dormant phase—although they could take to the streets again before the Supreme Court validates the results and Mr. Thieu is inaugurated in his second term at the end of October—the President now appears to be in a strong position. “The big question now is which way Thieu will go,” one diplomat said last week. “Will he crack down on the opposition and throw everybody in jail or will he ignore them?” That means, essentially: What will he do about Vice President Ky, an Air Vice Marshal whose job as Vice President will run out at the end of the month? Well before the election, Mr. Thieu promoted and obtained pledges of noninvolvement in politics from the country's most powerful generals. That was not too difficult to do, since his long‐range goal for Vietnam—peace through military victory over the Communists—is the goal that most of the generals believe in. Mr. Thieu is not likely to disturb this arrangement now by giving a new military command to a Vice Marshal Ky who had obviously been trying to interest the military in a coup d'etat. But other serious problems affecting the survival of the country are crowding in. The next year could be crucial. American forces, which once stood at 550,000 men, are now down to about 210,000. Last week the United States command in Saigon announced the impending withdrawal of another 5,800 men, including the first squadron of F‐4 Phantom jet bombers to leave Vietnam and a large part of the 23rd (Americal) Division, which was one of the last two full‐combat divisions here. President Nixon has said he will announce further withdrawals —possibly the last ones—next month. The diminished American presence means not only that a greater burden of the national defense will fall on the 1 million men under arms in Vietnam; it also means growing unemployment, loss of foreign exchange, and other serious problems for the Vietnamese economy, which is already ravaged by inflation. Mr. Thieu's Economic Minister, Pham Kim Ngoc, however, feels that the political climate is too tense for any immediate economic reforms such as a new devaluation of the piastre and more efficient collection of taxes. Some of the more militant antiGovernment leaders, like the Venerable Thich Minh Chieu of the Tinh Hoi Pagoda in Danang, are talking about “a long, protracted struggle” against the Government. But the less militant view of General Minh—that “the Americans are not yet ready to dump Thieu so it is too early to start struggling yet” — may yet be the stronger and more widespread one. If so, that view will work to the President Thieu's advantage.

Yankee Stadium is popularly known as “the House That Ruth Built,” but throughout its 48‐ year history a number of ten ants have used the Bronx arena. The New York Yankees, of course, always have been the primary tenants. The stadium, however, also has housed New York Giant football games since 1956, the great college football rivalries of Army‐Notre Dame and Fordham‐New York Uni versity, championship boxing matches and lesser publicized soccer matches. In addition, the stadium has been the site of circuses, masses offered by Pope Paul VI and Cardinal Spellman, meetings of the Jehovah's Witnesses and Billy Graham crusades. In fact, while the largest sports crowd at the stadium was the 81,841 who saw the Yankees play the Boston Red Sox in a double‐header in 1938, an even larger throng was es timated to have attended the mass celebrated by the Pope in 1965. The Yankees, under the own ership of Col. Jacob Ruppert, built the stadium—at a cost estimated at $2.5‐million—in 1922–23. The Yankees had been playing their home games in the Polo Grounds, but decided to build their own park for various reasons, including the tremendous popularity of Babe Ruth, the man whose home runs revolutionized baseball. The stadium remained in the Yankee family until 1953 when Del Webb and Dan Topping, who had acquired the ball club and the property from Colonel Ruppert's heirs, sold it to Earl and Arnold Johnson of Kansas City. The price of $6.5‐million included the park in which the Yankees farm team, the Kansas City Blues,, played. Two years later, the John sons sold the park to John William Cox, a Chicago banker, for an undisclosed price. Then in 1957, Mr. Cox sold the land on which the stadium stands to the Knights of Columbus for $2.5‐million, Five years after that, he made a gift of the stadium to Rice University. The Yankees were sold to the Columbia Broadcasting System in 1964, and three years later, the stadium underwent its most extensive refurbishing at the cost of $1,350,000. That's when the structure received the white coats of paint it wears today. Since the stadium opened on April 18, 1923, it has housed 27 World Series, two All‐Star baseball games, three National Football League championship games (including the 1958 sud den‐death contest between the Giants and the Baltimore Colts, one of the most famous games in football history) and 29 title fights. Fordham and N.Y.U. played football there 19 times while Army and Notre Dame battled each other 21 times, including 1946 when the cadets, with Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis, and the Irish, with Johnny Lujack, fought to a scoreless tie. Joe Louis successfully de fended his heavyweight boxing championship there seven times (he also was knocked out at the stadium by Max Schmeling before he was champion). Tony Zale knocked out Tony Grazi ano in a middleweight title bout and Willie Pep lost his featherweight crown to Sandy Saddler. The largest crowd to see a fight at the stadium was the 79,222 who saw Schmeling beat Jack Sharkey for the heavyweight title in 1930. Because of a change in seat ing and fire regulations, ca pacity now is about 65,000 for a baseball game and 63,000 for a football game.

1397-> Toxic Paint Is Found On Hospitals'
The city's year‐old Cam. Paign to eliminate lead poisoning among slum children has turned up another hazard —highly toxic paint on the walls of hospital pediatric wards. A survey by the Health Department's Bureau of Lead Poisoning Control showed that 20 per cent of the city's hospitals, public and private, had high lead paint levels.. Lead levels are particularly, toxic at four municipal hospitals, the survey shows. These are Lincoln, Kings County, Morrisania and Bellevue. Repairs are already under way, at Lincoln and Kings County hospitals. Dr. Vincent Guinee, director of lead poisoning control, commented yesterday that the risk was relatively slight for hospitalized children, since they were under closer supervision than at home.

1398-> RETRAINING PLANS FOUND TO AID FEW
SAN DIEGO, Aug. 6—The re training of out‐of‐work scien tists, engineers and technicians to provide them with new ca reers in such fields as environ mental control and urban plan ning appears to have met with scant success. For Paul A. Douillard, a phys icist and systems analyst, 16 weeks of retraining in anti pollution management turned out to be “an exercise in fu tility.” He is back where he was 18 months ago when he lost his $15,000 position with Computer Sciences Corporation here—still looking for work. “It's a pacification program, not a job program,” he said bit terly of the Pollution Manage ment Institute set up in Ana heim with Federal funds. Mr. Douillard is one of tens of thousands of engineers and skilled technicians who have been thrown out of work over the last three years, owing principally to cutbacks in aero space and defense contracts. Of Mr. Douillard's 95 class mates—unemployed specialists from Orange and San Diego Counties, where aerospace un employment levels are among the highest in the nation—only about 8 per cent were able to find jobs in the field of their new training. Their experience is typical of that of large numbers of the nation's unemployed profession al and skilled technicians who have sought to recycle their talents and make themselves more attractive in the crowded job market by enrolling in Fed eral and state retraining pro grams. But once retrained, they are finding very few job openings for their newly acquired skills. At several centers on the West Coast, where retraining has been most intensive, only 2 or 3 per cent of the grad uates have found employment. Rarely is the percentage higher than 10 or 11. Paradoxically the heaviest emphasis and expenditure has been on retraining for careers in a field where perhaps the fewest jobs currently are to be had. In some areas, four out of every five retrainees are preparing themselves for some branch of ecological manage ment and control because of growing national concern with problems of pollution, urban sprawl, transportation, sanita tion and safety. But thus far in both govern ment and industry money has been forthcoming slowly and in limited measure to transform that concern into actual job producing projects. Among state employment of ficials there appears to be growing criticism of the Gov ernment's retraining efforts as a cart ‐ before ‐ the ‐ horse ap proach. Some of these officials believe that the situation may well become worse before it gets better because of stringent budget tightening that con tinues to choke off job op portunities in industry and in Federal, state and local governments. Officials of the Department of Labor's Manpower Adminis tration take a more optimistic view. They say that “the hump is over” and that they see a steady decrease in the number of unemployed scientists, engi neers and technicians from now on. They point to Several re cently inaugurated programs, specifically aimed at benefiting such workers, that have not yet had time to make them selves felt. In most of the government programs for helping the tech nically skilled unemployed the emphasis is on retraining rather than job development. An ex ample is the new $42‐million technology Mobilization and Re employment Program for 14 areas in 11 states hard hit by aerospace and defense cut backs. Of the $42‐million, about $25‐million is earmarked for retraining and only $5‐million for seeking out jobs. Initial achievements of the Mobilization and Re‐employ ment program served to under score the problem. Of 13,342 who enrolled at the start, fewer than 300 have been placed in jobs three months later. For most of the retraining programs, which generally pro vide subsistence allowances of about $75 a week, there are from 15 to 30 times more ap plicants than can be enrolled. They are drawn from the 75,000 to 100,000 scientists engineers and technical people whom the Labor Department lists as un employed, one‐third of them in California. “We're still hearing the same old talk about matching people with jobs but there are no jobs for them to be matched with,” said Rolfe Thompson, California state employment consultant. “What is needed is a big and costly program to create jobs, then we can talk about retraining.” In many sections of the coun try, including several of the 11 states that have “critical” areas of technical unemploy ment, retraining prcgrams are just now getting under way after waiting for the release of Federal funding. These in clude Seattle, Boston, Long Is land, St. Louis and Florida's Cape Kennedy area, all of which until recently have had no major retraining programs de spite their high levels of un employment. The first university project to provide unemployed aero space workers with a master's degree in environmental engi neering attracted national at tention and high hopes when it opened last January at the Uni versity of California in Irvine with 26 students and Federal funding. It was hailed as the model for similar graduate courses at other universities and colleges. Today, little more than half way through its first course, the. Irvine experiment's sur vival is threatened because of the scarcity of jobs for its graduates. “If these 26 students were graduating tomorrow I doubt if we could find a job for a single one of them,” said the placement manager, George Wandrocke. The. University of. Southern California has been offering a regular graduate course in air pollution control since 1965 and finding jobs for 75 or 80 per cent of its graduates. Last April under a grant from the Environmental Protection Agen cy, it began a special 14‐week course for 20 unemployed aero space and defense engineers. Only three of the 20 re trainees have found employ ment thus far, a fact that the program's director, Mrs. Gloria Barbaro, finds “terribly disap pointing.” “A number of companies ex pressed interest in our retrain ing graduates but their budgets were so limited that they couldn't hire them,” she said. So tight is the job market for almost all types of engi neers that professional place ment agencies are being en listed to find positions for those coming out of retraining pro grams. The California Human Re sources Development Commis sion is using four such con cerns of “headhunters,” the largest of, which is Image West in Encino. “These guys aren't the easi est people to place,” said Image West's president, Al Hughes Jr. “Many employers don't want to talk with anyone from aerospace. They look upon them as eggheads and prima donnas.” Most retraining officials agree that the attitude of employers toward applicants with aero space‐defense backgrounds is a problem. Some concerns regard these applicants as having been overpaid and pampered, with slight regard for cost con trol and production schedules. Others complain that they are “too specialized” in back ground and attitude. Despite the grim prospects In other fields, however, there are aerospace professionals such as John P. Gordon who are anxious to switch careers even though they have man aged to hold on to their jobs. Mr. Gordon, a Los Angeles metallurgist, has been laid off three times in 15 months, twice at Lockheed and once at North rup. He is now working at North American Rockwell. He wants to get out because “this business is just too uncertain.” A recent California survey reported that nearly half the engineers and technicians still working for aerospace and de fense concerns were disen chanted and would like to get into a different field.

1399-> Compatibility Called Key to Building Plan
A bigger battle than the Muhammad Ali‐Joe Frazier fight may be shaping up in Greenwich Village, where the city's best urban gladiators live. It is also’ where a hole on. West 11th Street has become a landmark of sorts, and the urban fight is about what will fill the hole. Because the “town house ex‐plosion,” as it is already known in instant revolutionary mythology, destroyed one house of a handsome mid‐19th century row officially designated as a city landmark, the Landmarks Preservation Commission must pass on the “appropriateness” of the replacement. An Appraisal The design submitted to the commission yesterday; by the architect, Hugh Hardy, is about to become new Battle of the Bulge. The house will apparently stand or fall, or be built or not built, on the basis of 24 inches of projecting brick on the building's front. A Diagonal Plan Inside What Mr. Hardy has proposed is a skillful, extremely sophisticated and highly controversial blend of old and new. The controversy revolves almost totally around a section of angled facade between the attic story and the basement, recessed about three feet at one side and projecting two feet on the other. This reflects a diagonal plan on the inside, and indicates clearly that Mr. Hardy does not believe that a house built in 1971 should look like a house built in 1844. “I cannot accept the thought of badly reproducing a house of 1844,” he said at the hearing. have tried to knit the wall of the street back together, but with a structure suitable to ourselves.” Mr. Hardy is one of New York's younger, and more talented architects, and so his solution is not exactly anonymous. But it is based on eight months of painstaking study to find a kind of contemporary harmony that will live well with the. past. As in marriage, compatibility is the key word. It is on the definition of harmony or compatibility that the commission's difficult decision must rest. It was obvious from many Villagers present at the hearing that the only thing they would be happy to see was a reconstruction of the house that was destroyed, perhaps just a little “truer” to the original than later “Federal. izing” (stoop removal Viand door faking) had made it. The commission can safely settle for such an “archeological” approach, and run no risks other than those of historical and esthetic hypocrisy. This is the school of preservation that believes in reproducing old details with injected plastic in vacuum molds—a kind of false bosom approach. Waxworks, but nice. Or It can, like the historical city of Savannah, which has an enlightened landmark policy, judge appropriateness in terms of relationships of scale, surface, texture, color, material, general effect and use. When the old fabric is gone, it cannot be brought back. Something must replace it that weds past to present. Done sensitively. without fakery, this is true historical continuity, and the genuine culture of cities. Twofold Conviction This is the much harder way, but it has the virtue of historical validity. Mr. Hardy's design has that virtue. It seeks appropriateness without mimicry or makebelieves He has worked conscientiously in the context of a beautiful, if somewhat mutilated, 19th‐century survival; he is sensitively aware of the need to relate to. it. His refusal to do so through pretending that the paste can be built in the present grows out of a moral as well as an esthetic conviction. Whether the Landmarks Commission shares this conviction remains to be seem The design they have under advisement is a brilliant attempt at synthesis of new and old. It is a strong statement, and that may be its weakness. Some shading, even a few inches of adjustment can make a difference. In a street where uniformity is not so much real as the product of subtle similarities, a design of conviction and talent can have its proper place. Mr. Hardy is not willing to pretend that there was no bomb. Or that history of another kind is not now part of West 11th Street. Architecture is not a stageset; it is the continuing evidence of a city's reality. Nothing can bring number 18 to life again, The house is dead; long live the house.

1400-> Dance: A Modernist Trend in London
LONDON, Aug 6—The quest for the English version of the American modem dance continues apace. At least I think it is apace that it is continuing. Not only has the Royal Ballet mounted a new work by Glen Tetley— in which even Rudolf Nu reyev is scheduled to appear next season — but also two modern‐dance companies are making considerable head way with British critics and, to perhaps a lesser extent, with British audiences. The Ballet Rambert I have missed this year, al though reports suggest that it has enjoyed a good sea son. Its rival, the more overt ly American‐oriented London Contemporary Dance Theater, I caught this week in the London suburb of Richmond. The company is directed by Robert Cohan—the ex Martha Graham dancer—and its style is based on the Gra ham school. This season the 2‐year‐old company has made its first appearances in Paris and Switzerland, and in October it is scheduled to dance in Czechoslovakia and Poland. The intense critical popu larity of American modern dance in Britain during the last decade has been one of the most remarkable aspects of the international dance scene. Now, although the London Contemporary Dance Theater still looks grafted onto London rather than in digenous, it is a company of some quality, and has the vitality of Mr. Cohan. In fact, the vitality of his latest work, “Consolation of the Rising Moon,” is at a strangely low ebb, Set to gui tar music arranged by John Williams, the work meanders along with a certain aimless amiability. Far more impressive is his study of phsychic conflicts and the claustrophobia in duced by modern society, “Cell,” in which William Lou ther was the brilliantly op pressed protagonist. The program was complet ed by Richard Alston's “No where Slowly,” a trio to mu sic, by Terry Riley that showed “a good stage sense, a definite musicality and a gentle yet marked inventive ness. As in Mr. Cohan's latest work there was a tendency to saunter rather than to move, yet the work was well‐danced. • The company Is clearly progressing—it would I think be interesting to see it in New York one day — and these are yet early days in which to Judge its achieve ment. Yet it has still to demonstrate that it can de velop a specifically English form of American modern dance. Perhaps it doesn't have to — but can exist hap pily forever as an American transplant. The next few years will obviously be cru cial.

1401-> Arsenal Beats Chelsea, 3‐0, in British Soccer Opener
LONDON, Aug. 14 (Reuters) —Arsenal opened its defense of the English League First Di vision soccer title in convinc ing style today by scoring a 3‐0 victory over Chelsea, the holder of the European Cup Winners Cup. Arsenal, which completed the rare League and Football Asso ciation Cup double last season, thrilled the crowd of 49,000 with its attacking power. Frank McLintock headed Arsenal into a 16th‐minute lead before Ray Kennedy and John Radford put second‐half shots past Peter Bonetti, the Chelsea goalkeep er, to complete the scoring. Bertie Mee of Arsenal was presented with the “manager of the year” award before the kickoff. Leeds United, runner‐up for the last two seasons, kept pace with Arsenal by beating Man chester City, 1‐0, in a tough match marked by the booking of Norman Hunter and Jackie Charlton of Leeds and Francis Lee and Mick Doyle of Man chester City. Peter Lorimer broke the scoreless deadlock in the 70th minute to give Leeds its 2 points. This was the first of eight successive road games for Leeds. Liverpool also made an im pressive start. Kevin Keegan, celebrated his Liverpool debut by scoring the first goal in 3‐1 victory over Nottingham Forest. Tottenham Hotspur appeared in trouble when it trailed the Wolverhampton Wanderers, 2‐0, following goals by Bobby Gould and Frank Wignal, but Martin Chivers and Alan Gil zean scored to earn Tottenham a 2‐2 draw. Manchester United, playing its first league match under manager Frank O'Farrell, also squandered a two‐goal lead in its match against Derby Coun ty. Denis Law and Alan Dow ling had given United a won derful start with well‐taken goals, before Kevin Hector and John O'Hare scored for Derby. ???

1402-> A Goalie's Working Day: Stopping Shots and Helping the Injured
Per the first time since the All‐Star break, ‐ the Rangers showed yesterday how good they could be as they whipped the Detroit Red Wings, 4‐1, and completed a 16‐hour stretch in which they gained 4 points on the Boston Bruins. It was a game that reunited a bunch of former teammates, most of them ex‐Rangers such as. Arnie Brown and Mike Robi taille, who now wear the Santa Claus‐red of the Wings, a club with nine new players. But Bruce MacGregor, once a Detroiter, had his be game as a New. Yorker as he: up three assists, playing on a line with another former Red. Wing, Pete Stemkowski. Of course, the visitors failed to show much as they complete the string of a dismal mason that finds them trying to stay out of last place against; two new National Hockey League teams. To compound their troubles, the Wings played without Gor die Howe, Dale. Rolfe and Mickey Redmond. Howe has the flu and Rolfe and Redmond are injured. Detroit lost an other experienced player in the opening period when Ron‐Har ris injured his left knee. The triumph meant 2 points for the Rangers, and it brought them to within 7 of the East Division‐leading Boston Bruins. Robitaille, one of the many young prospects the Rangers have traded in an attempt to catch the Bruins, preserved his nameplate. It was pasted over his clothes hook. “That,” he said ruefully, “is may share of the playoff money.” Robitaille, who has 5 points in eight games with his new team, said, “the Rangers are better than I thought. They're a tough team to play against. I didn't realize it when I played with them, but that Stemkow ski is a 200‐pound sandbag.” Brown also used the word “they,” as he spoke of the Rangers and how “they kept coming at us.” He had to get physical with Walt Tkaczuk and Rod Gilbert. “When you're having tough time,” he explained, you've got to take the body. I'm not going to give them the puck. They understand that.” The crowd of 17,250 at Madison Square Garden and the national television audience saw the Ranger forwards drive into the Wings' zone repeatedly, Checking the diffused Detroit ers, who rarely could get off a decent, pass to start the play heading in the opposite direc tion. Stemkowski opened the scoring in the second period, with one of 19 shots New York blasted at Roy Edwards, who kept the Wings alive until the final session. Tim Ecclestone tied the score in the third period. It proved to be the only goal Ed Gia comin allowed in the two, games since his return from, a bout with the flu. Jim Neilson, Walt Tkaczuk and Ted Irvine, then got three goals within 11 Minutes 2 seconds for the vic tory.

1403-> Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: The contributions of Dr. Albert Szent‐Gyorgyi to science are many, and few will dispute his meritorious activities as a creative and imaginative scientist. Less meritorious was his contribution to the Sept. 26 Op‐Ed page (“America Is All Upside Down”). I venture to say that had this been a scientific article of parallel merit, it would not have been accepted by the average critical journal. Dr. Szent‐Gyorgyi feels that we have been using our treasures for rigging an election for a corrupt, antidemocratic government in Vietnam. No mention is made of the alternative: domination by the even less democratic government of North Vietnam. He claims that our leaders do their scheming behind closed doors: How does he expect a government to be run —on the market place? He charges this country with responsibility for the arms race, and by implication for the millions of children (half the world's children, to quote) who go to bed hungry. Finally, he ends in the beautiful but meaningless phrase that we must urgently start Americanizing America instead of Vietnamizing Vietnam. The breast‐pounding of many members of the academic community of the United States is just as illogical as the uncritical super‐patriotism of other parts of the population. It is precisely the academic community, however, which cannot afford illogical and emotional effusions without further reducing the level of its already tarnished credibility.

1404-> Rural Uruguayans Wary Of Communist Candidates
TACUAREMBO, Uruguay, Nov. 14—In the Uruguayan range country around Tacuarembo distances across the prairie are still measured in leagues and until recently politics was seen in only two colors: the white of the Nationals and the red of the Colorados, the two parties that have governed the country for more than a century. For the presidential election next Sunday, there is a third factor—the “Broad Front,” coalition of Christian Democrats, Communits and Socialists; an independent movement identified with the Tupamaros, Uruguay's urban guerrillas; and two groups that broke away from the left wings of the two traditional parties. They have come together behind a single non‐Communist candidate, Gen. Liber Seregni Mosquera, a retired army officer, and a platform modeled closely after President Salvador Allende Gossens, in his successful election campaign in Chile last year. The Front promises agrarian reform, nationalization of all private banks and foreign trade, and an anti‐imperialist foreign policy, including diplomatic relations with Cuba. In this region, according to voting records, the Christian Democratic party is the Broad Front's main source of strength. “We all agree that the two traditional parties haven't solved any of the country's problems for years and the Front has a good program to change the whole thing,” said Hugo Laborde, a cattle dealer. “But the Front has the Communist party in it, so now what do we do?” 11 Candidates on Ballot About 1.8 million voters have to decide what to do on Nov. 28. There are 11 presidential candidates, including President Jorge Pacheco Areco of the Colorado party, who is seeking re‐election. But the voters and the campaign propaganda declare that the basic choice is between the Broad Front and the old, two‐party system. “Yes, sir, I would say the Front is pretty small around here,” said a cowboy driving a herd toward Tacuaremb6. “It's Communist, you know, which may be a big thing in other countries and well organized, but it doesn't sit well with us in Uruguay.” Tacuarembo is the kind of place where Model T Fords, lovingly maintained, are the most common working cars and where traffic waits patiently when a driver stops for a short conversation on the narrow streets, lined with plane trees. The bookstores are stocked with picture magazines and ranching handbooks. The largest stores in town sell saddles, tools and branding irons and smell of fertilizer and sheep. Election posters are hung from branches so the trunks of the trees will not be injured by staples or nails. Two hundred and twenty miles to the south, Montevideo, with its militant strikes, urban guerrillas, campaign violence and swollen public payroll, seems like another world. “Dead weight,” or “parasite,” they call the capital city here, or “a cancer we have to live with.” Several Plants Are. Shut But Montevideo's crisis has reached out to Tacuaremb6. The corrals at the meat‐packing plant are empty. The plant, like 13 others of the 15 plants that earn most of Uruguay's foreign exchange, bas been closed since June. The plants that process vegetable oil and tobacco here are also closed. In Uruguay's last election, five years ago, only 853 voters out of the 41,000 in this region voted for the Communist party. Some might have been ideological rebels. This time there will be protest votes for the (Broad Front, like that of Juan Rios, a 65‐year‐old chemist who voted the white ticket of the National party through 1966. “Then ‘I saw what was happening to the country: That the traditional parties simply were not governing and could not solve our problems,” he said. “We used to have the best standard of living in South America. Now we don't. To live, we have to change political structures, not political personalities.” Mr. Rios recognizes that the Front, in Tacuarembo, appeals to the town elite, to middleclass professional people like himself, and even more to their educated sons and daughters. In the countryside, however, he says, the Front disappears. As if to sustain his argument, a ranch hand hardly stopped working on range fences to ‘say: “Me, I don't know a damn thing about politics, but I'm going to vote white. Always have.” The ranch owner, a big, hawk‐nosed man named Ruben Ricceto, said he had thought about politics a long time and had no use for it. “In my lifetime, we have had white governments and Colorado governments. and none of them was any good,” he said during a ride around his ranch. “All their candidates this time, all of them, are tainted if not rotten with speculation or buying votes with state jobs. So there's the Broad Front and I support its program wholeheartedly, but I'm afraid of the men.” “I'm afraid of the Communist party,” said Mr. Ricceto, “So I don't have any choice. I'm going to vote a blank ballot.”

1405-> PRICE PANEL CUTS BLUE CROSS RISE IN FEDERAL RATES
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23—The Price Commission, applying new insurance guidelines for the first time, trimmed rate increase on health and medical coverage for 1.6 million Federal workers from 34.1 per cent to 22 per cent. Commission officials said that, while the results would differ depending on the kind of insurance and the company involved, the same Federal standards would be applied in the same way to all requests for premium increases. The reduction today was on a request to raise rates for Federal civilian employes around the country who are under a Blue Cross‐Blue Shield program. It is the largest of 40 insurance plans for Government workers. Only 22 Per Cent ‘Justified’ “We studied the proposed increase in great detail and found that only a 22 per cent increase was justified under our guidelines,” the commission chairman, C. Jackson Grayson Jr., explained. In another action today, President Nixon, as expected, decided that there would not be controls on interest rates. His determination that controls were not necessary, because interest rates were stable or declining, was required by the legislation he signed yesterday extending price and wage control authority to April 30, 1973. The legislation said there must also be controls on interest rates unless the President made a specific determination that they were not necessary. Mr. Grayson said that the reduction in the insurance rate increase had been ordered because of “adjustments of cost estimates and other elements in the requested increase.” Commission officials declined to elaborate. Effect of New Regulations But it was apparent that at least three provisions of the commission's complex insurance regulations, announced yesterday, had contributed to trimming the Blue Cross‐Blue Shield premium rise. First, the commission has warned insurers that it will not permit them to recoup losses in previous years by raising rates on future coverage, and it was understood that Blue Cross‐Blue Shield had sought to do this. The insurer said that it had lost $8‐million on the plan for Federal workers in 1970 and $60‐million in 1971. An official of the Civil Service Commission said that these losses were atributable mainly to increased benefits for outpatient X‐rays and tests. Second, the Price Commission has said that companies must reduce their allowances for inflation to 62.5 per cent of their present forecasts, and this requirement is expected to ‘have a particularly heavy impact on most health and medical policies. Third, insurance concerns, will not be allowed to pass on in rate increases more than a 2.5 per cent advance in their “company controlled expenses,” such as administration costs. These have generally been rising 5 per cent a year. Other health carriers and many automobile insurers have complained of losses and have asserted the need for compensating increases in premiums, and presumably these would be blocked by the Price Commission. Limits Found Restrictive In addition, the limits on anticipated inflation are expected by insurance authorities to be especially restrictive for health insurers generally because of the major price increases in medical care. Mr. Grayson indicated in statement that insurance companies that wanted to recover losses or avoid future squeezes because of the Government standards would have to cut their costs. “Unless the users, providers, and insurance companies exercise greater discipline in this area, it will not be possible to provide this service to Federal employes without substantial increases in premiums,” he said. There were reports that an even sharper cut had been under consideration, but that the move would have jeopardized the Federal program. Neither point could be confirmed, however. A Government source did say that Blue Cross‐Blue Shield, which originally asked for a 53 per cent increase and was cut to 34.1 per cent by the Civil Service Commission, had talked of discontinuing its participation in the program. The insurer's offices were closed this I afternoon, and there was no immediate reaction. In another development on insurance, Donald Rumsfeld, director of the Cost of Living Council, said that only those companies with annual revenues of more than $250‐million would have to seek advance approval for premium increases. For other businesses, incomes of more than $100‐million require advance permission to raise prices. Others either must report their action afterwards or face spot checks, depending on their size. Mr. Rumsfeld said that 62 per cent of the dollar volume of insurance would still be covered by the requirement for advance approval. At present, companies with 80 per cent of the volume must go to the Price Commission to raise rates. In other areas, Mr. Rumsfeld announced that fee increases by state and local governments for services such as garbage collection would not have to be cleared in advance but that these would be monitored to assure” they remain consistent with the Federal economic program. Average raises should not exceed 2.5 per cent, and state and local authorities will be asked to submit semiannual reports on what they do. State and local taxes are already exempt from Federal price controls. Some Increases Not Exempted Today's exemption does not cover hospital and health care provided by state or local authorities nor utilities that are operated by state or local governments. Government workers may get wage increases of 5.5 per cent a year without advance Pay Board approval, Mr. Rumsfeld announced, but pay rises over this amount would require special exception. In answer to a question, Mr. Rumsfeld said that transit workers in New York City, who are now negotiating for a large wage rise, would he included as municipal workers under this requirement. The Cost of Living Council issued the formal “determination and statement of reasons” on interest rates tonight after it had first been disclosed by Representative Wright Patman, Democrat of Texas, chairman of the House Banking Committee. The statement cited a number of recent interest rate declines, but it conceded that “as economic expansion accelerates in the months ahead, interest rates generally may rise somewhat.” Mr. Patman, according to spokesman, believes that the Presidential findings “do not begin to meet the requirements of the law.” While Mr. Nixon listed recent declines in some interest rates, he did not make the necessary findings on the whole range of rates, the spokesman said.

1406-> NIXON AIDES DEFEND HUNGER DRIVE ROLE
WASHINGTON, March 2—A panel of Federal officials, ac knowledging that much more remains to be done, testified today that the Nixon Admini stration had built a “record of dramatic achievement” against hunger. Their testimony offered position opposed to that of wit nesses who last week argued that the Administration should not be permitted to rest on its oars with the job half done. Both sides appeared at hear ings of the Senate Select Com mittee on Nutrition and Human Needs, which has repeatedly pressed for greater spending for antihunger programs. Describing the entire Ad ministration program, Richard Lyng, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, said today that the proposed spending total for the fiscal year 1972 was $3.3‐ billion, nearly triple the 1969 expenditure. In the last year, he said, the number of persons served by Federal family feeding pro grams had jumped from 7.7 million to 13.6 million and the number of children receiving subsidized school lunches had increased from 4.5 million to 6.4 million.

1407-> The World
— At the Labor party conference here last week, a left‐wing delegate rearmed Royden Harrison, a profolsor at Warwick University, was called on to speak during the Common Market debate. He began by remarking that in his many years as a delegate this was the first time he had ever risen to support a position taken by the party executive. That little confession said good deal about the state of the Labor party. There are many men and women like Professor Harrison, long since grown accustomed to conflict with the party leadership, who suddenly find themselves agreeing. And it is the leadership that has changed, not they. Labor has shifted to the left. That was the obvious message at this year's conference. The change was evident in the speeches, filled with clichés about capitalist oppression. It resounded in the tone of many successful resolutions, and it was painfully clear in attitudes taken by the party leader, Harold Wilson, and many of his colleagues. The issue that dominated the conference, the Common Market, showed most dramatically how far the party has moved. Just two years ago, a Labor Government was determinedly pressing for British membership in the European community. Mr. Wilson, as Prime Minister, said he would “not take no for an answer.” Now here was the same Mr. Wilson giving the back of his hand to the community as a mere “commercial setup,” “autarchic” and “rigged.” The “humiliating” terms on which the Conservative Government proposed to take Britain in, he said, “can only mean crippling Britain's strength.” All the experts have proclaimed that Prime Minister Heath's terms are the best that a Labor Government could have hoped for. The Labor ex‐Ministers connected with the negotiations have all said so. It is not, then, the Common Market or the negotiating terms that have changed. It is Mr. Wilson. Why? He saw that he was about to be assaulted by a new antimarket majority in the party and, like the heroine of Fielding's “Jonathan Wild,” he saved himself by a timely compliance. How has it happened? Three separate reasons can be identified for Labor's shift to the left. The first is a phenomenon really outside the political structure. This country's two largest unions, the Transport Workers and the Engineers, have come under far‐left control in recent years. Jack Jones and Hugh Scanlon, their respective leaders, are dedicated to a totally socialist economy at home and an end to traditional foreign alliances. And they cast huge bloc votes in the Labor party conference. Second, the loss of power has inevitably relaxed the restraints of responsibility. Opposition parties are understandably and rightly less cautious than governments. In office, Mr. Wilson and his colleagues had to deal with the reality of limited resources, of financial pressure, of dependence on allies. Now they can please their supporters by sounding more jingoistic and promising pie in the sky. The third reason is probably the most compelling right now. The nature of the Conservative Government. Mr. Heath has deliberately set out to junk the centrist policies of postwar governments, both Labor and Tory. He has told the country that it needs a strong dose of the free market, one without government controls and subsidies. The objective economic situation in Britain supports this Labor tendency to harsh reaction against Mr. Heath. The unemployment total is nearing 1 million, the highest level since the terrible days of the Depression. Prices have gone up 10 per cent in a year. But political systems as resilient as Britain's do not easily abandon the politics of consensus, left‐wing professors notwithstanding. And so one should be careful in appraising the significance of what happened in Brighton last week. To win elections, as opposed to giving its own conference delegates a happy moment, the Labor party has to appeal to the center. There could be no surer recipe for another long stretch of Conservative rule than an opposition lurching out of control to the left. And the key Labor politicians know that perfectly well. That is why Mr. Wilson, as he bends to his left, would like to keep on his team the main right‐wing figure in the party—Roy Jenkins, the deputy leader. To the public Mr. Jenkins is a welcome symbol of constancy and integrity in politics. He has made clear that he will vote with the Government for British entry into the Common Market when the principle is settled in the House of Commons on Oct. 28. During the Brighton week Mr. Wilson floated the idea of a deal with Mr. Jenkins and his followers. They would vote as planned on Oct. 28 but would then return to the party line by opposing the consequential legislation to follow— detailed measures bringing British law into line with Common Market rules. The idea does interest the Jenkins group, which reckons that Mr. Heath can handle the details with his own Tory votes anyway. But any such accommodation would infuriate the far left. The Common Market was not originally a left‐right issue, but the left has increasingly seen it as a symbol of elitist forces, “not real working‐class socialists,” trying to run the party. And Mr. Wilson will not go so far to accommodate Mr. Jenkins as to risk his own skin. The left now controls two organs of power in the Labor party, the conference and the party executive. But its hold is less sure in the ultimate political group, the Labor members of Parliament. They elect the leader and his shadow Cabinet. The next and crucial test will be the Parliamentary party's behavior when Mr. Jenkins and his supporters vote with the Government for Europe on Oct. 28.

1408-> JASPER RUNNERS WIN 3‐WAY MEET
ANNAPOLIS, Md., Feb. 6— Manhattan College, led by Tom Donahue, a senior, defeated Navy and Penn State today in a triangular meet at the Navy Field House. The Jaspers totaled 52 points, Penn State had 45 and Navy 40. Manhatan down by 12 points to Navy at the end of the field events were helped by Don ahue's victory in the mile run. Donahue was clocked in 4 min utes 5.9 seconds to beat Greg Fredericks of Penn State by 20 yards. Fredericks was clocked in 4:08.8. Donahue came back 40 min utes later to win the two‐mile run with an excellent 9:01.4 clocking. John Lovet, a Man hattan sophomore out of Power Memorial High School, set a Manhattan record of 2:09.9 to win the 1,000‐yard run. That time also qualified Lovett for the National Collegiate cham pionships in Detroit in March. Joe Savage, Manhattan's freshman middle distance ace, also set a Manhattan record and also qualified for the N.C.A.A. mile with a 4:05.9 mile, a Field House freshman record. Savage also anchored Manhat tan's winning freshman two mile relay with a 1:52.4 clocking. The Jaspers took the first three places in the 600‐yard run with Mike Kenny, a senior, posting his career best with a time of 1:11.4. Bill Kirwan, a sophomore sprinter from Hunt ington, L. I., took first in the 60‐yard dash with a 6.3 clock ing to beat his teammate, Capt. Bill Cabeche, at the tape. Ca beche's time was also 6.3. Cliff Bruce and Chris Condon, freshmen, also set meet and Manhattan records. Bruce ran 2:11.1 to win the 1,000‐yard run and Condon won the two mile in 9:08.8 to break the rec ord he set earlier in the year. It was the second straight year Manhattan has won this meet. The Navy plebes defeated the Manhattan freshmen, 58‐42.

1409-> A RELIGIOUS ISSUE RAISED ON U.S. AID
WASHINGTON, March 2— The Supreme Court was asked today to stop the Federal Gov ernment from financing the con struction of academic buildings and dormitories on the cam puses of sectarian colleges and universities. Leo Pfeffer, counsel for the American Jewish Congress, as‐, serted in court arguments that the Department of Education was violating the Constitution and the 1963 aid‐te‐education act by financing construction on the campuses of colleges that exist largely to propagate re ligious denominations. “The United Staten will have to police these institutions for 20 years,” he charged, to see that they do not violate their agreements not to use the build ings for religious services or teaching. First Test of Act His statements came in argu ments of the first Supreme Court test of the Higher Educa tion Facilities Act, under which $1.5‐billion in Federal money has been paid for construction on college campuses. About 15 per cent of the money has gone to religious institutions, another 15 per cent has gone to non sectarian private colleges and the rest has gone to state uni versities. The law excludes financing for buildings that are to be used for religious instruction or worship, or for divinity school buildings. If these con ditions are observed for 20 years, the buildings become the property of the institutions, which can then use them as they wish. The A.J.C. and the American Civil Liberties Union spon sored a suit by 15 taxpayers in Connecticut who challenged grants to four Roman Catholic colleges there. In his amiri,‐?? today, Mr. Pfeffer stressed that grants to institutions that are, merely “church‐related” are not illegal. He said they become il legal when they go to “sectar ian” institutions, which exist largely for the “propagation and teaching of the practice of religions.” The lower court held that so long as the buildings were used for purely secular purposes, the payments would be legal, even if the colleges admitted only members of one religion and required all students to take religious instruction.

1412-> Anatomy of an Unending Manhunt
A month ago, two New York City patrolmen were shot and killed as they walked out of a Harlem housing project. Today, after the ex ploration of dozens of leads by scores of policemen, the killers have not been found. Detectives working around the clock have talked to hun dreds of people, ranging from potential witnesses to the department's vast net work of informers. Although the trail is now apparently growing cold, the investiga tion is very much alive. The police have evolved at least these primary the ories on the killings during the month‐long manhunt: ¶The murders were com mitted on the spur of the moment by two armed men who might have been fearful that the police were ap proaching them and would find their guns. ¶The killings were part of a plan by a militant black group to murder policemen, and the opportunity for ac tion presented itself as the un suspecting patrolmen walked out of the project. ¶The policemen may have been mistaken for Housing Authority patrolmen. There has been a persistent report that at least one housing patrolmen at the project had earned the emnity of some residents and had allegedly been in a fistfight in a near by tavern several days be fore the shooting. During the investigation, a reporter from The New York Times was permitted by po lice Officials to view the man hunt from the inside. This, then, is the anatomy of their investigation. It all began at 10:30 on a cool Friday evening last May 21 when two young men, seeing two uniformed police men, slipped off a parked white car on which they had been lounging, crept up be hind them and opened fire with two 45‐caliber pistols. The patrolmen, one black, the other white, slumped to the asphalt walkway outside Colonial Houses, a complex of brick buildings at 159th Street and the Harlem River Drive. Their assailants kept firing as the two men lay dead or dying. The black patrolman, Wa verly M. Jones, was shot four times, at least once in the head, with bullets from a 45. His 38‐caliber service revolver was missing when his body was found. The white patrolman, Jo seph A. Piagentini, was shot 12 times, only once with a bullet from a 45. The other 11 slugs came from two 38‐ caliber revolvers, presumably from his own and his part ner's guns. Reaction to the shootings was immediate and massive. Scores of patrolmen and de tectives, outraged and grief stricken, converged on the murder scene. All night long they punched doorbells throughout the housing project, searching for witnesses. They painstak ingly combed the nearby sidewalks, gutters and sew ers, and the roofs of low‐ lying buildings, looking in vain for the guns used and stolen in the assault. During the night and the following day the investiga tors produced at least six witnesses who were able to provide some description of the killers. A composite draw ing by a police artist of one of the suspects was made and sent to police stations and newspapers. Police experts dusted the hood and fenders of the white Mustang parked at the curb outside the project in a search for fingerprints. Sev eral blank cartridges and spent bullets were found at the murder scene. A team of detectives checked out a woman who had called the police to her home—the call to which Pa trolmen Jones and Piagen tini had responded. It was a legitimate call for help. She had been cut by a knife in an argument. Witnesses described the as sailants of the slain police men as two young black men. One was said to be 18 to 24 years old, 6 feet tall, 150 to 160 pounds, dark ‐ skinned with an ?? haircut and wearing blue denim clothes and an oversized cap. The second man was more vaguely described as 20 to 24 years old, 5 feet 7 inches to 5 feet 9 inches tall, weighing 155 to 170 pounds, with a stocky build and dark skin. The composite drawing was of the young man said to be wearing an oversized cap. Un fortunately, composite draw ings are not that accurate. In succeeding days, there were telephone calls and letters from all over the city and indeed the country from peo ple who said they recognized the suspect. All these leads, no matter how far‐fetched, were checked by weary detectives. All were fruitless. Some detectives, not many, openly carried shotguns in those first few days. A racial tension, openly denied, but privately conceded, was evi dent in police ranks. Many men believed the killings and the machine gun wounding of two patrolmen two days ear lier on the Upper West Side were the opening shots in a war against police by mili tant blacks. After more than 5,000 policemen from New York City and some 45 cities at tended the funeral for Patrol man Jones, a white policeman said that “we'll have to get more men at Piagentini's services.” About the same number of men attended both funerals, Which were a day apart. There was a brief flurry of excitement on Monday, May 24, three days after the killings, when Chief Inspector Michael J. Codd announced that a man he described as a “prime suspect” had been captured and was being ques tioned. Within 24 hours, however, the police said that the man, identified as Leroy King of 341 West 121st Street, had been cleared, although he was arrested for the illegal possession of a policeman's gun. Later the charge was dismissed for lack of evi dence. Chief of Detectives Albert A. Seedman had arrived at Kennedy International Air port on Monday, called home from a vacation in Israel by Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy to take personal charge of the case. Chief Seedman, a tough talking, burly man who speaks from whichever cor ner of his mouth is unoccu pied by a cigar, went im mediately to the station of the 32d Precinct, at 250 West 135th Street. Some 40 detectives were assigned to a special team operating out of the station. All of them — black, white, modishly dressed and those who resembled hippies or in digents—were hard‐faced and determined. Many had eyes hollow with fatigue. “This is the worst crime to ever hit this city,” said a white detective working on the case. “The guys aren't going to rest until it's solved.” Chief Seedman tended to see the killings as the out break of guerrilla warfare by radical blacks against the police. He also felt the ma chine‐gunning two nights before the two policemen were killed was probably linked to the murders. “If this is true,” he said in his black sedan one after noon while cruising through Harlem, “this homicide is the forerunner of violent action by militant groups, and it could be more important to American society than the Vietnam war.” “These shootings were di rected at the Establishment, not at whites or blacks,” he went on. “Once they begin killing cops, then all society is threatened.” Chief Seedman said he did not feel that the attacks were racially motivated since one Of the dead men was black. He also pointed out that “five of the seven cops killed so far this year in the line of duty have been black.” The Chief also felt strong ly that the murders and the machine‐gunning were some how connected because “both were unprovoked attacks on policemen.” He also had an other thread linking the two crimes. Two days after the ma chine gun attack—about an hour and a half before the murders—a black man deliv ered a package to The New York Times that contained a license plate from a car being sought in the assault. The plate, 8373‐YR New York, was accompanied by a 45‐caliber bullet and a type written message in which the writer took credit for the as sault. A similar package was received by radio station WLIB‐FM in Harlem. The two messages said, in part, that “the armed goons of this racist government will again meet the guns of op pressed peoples as long as they occupy our community and murder our brothers and sisters in the name of Amer ican law and order.” Three days after the double murder, another message was received by WLIB from a group identifying itself as part of “The Black Liberation Army” that praised the kill ings and took credit for them. Both notes were analyzed in the laboratories of the po lice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washing ton, and it was quickly learned that both had been written on the same typewriter. At one point in the weeks following the murders, Chief Seedman declared that he thought he knew where the typewriter was and he decid ed to stage a raid. Then he changed his mind. “I probably could find the typewriter, but I still haven't got the gun,” he explained. “Besides, all a raid would do would be to stir up a hornet's nest. That would make no sense at this time. If we started to move, people would flee the city and we'd have a hard time finding them. I'd rather have them think we're stupid and nowhere near them.” On May 26, 18‐year‐old Clarence Lee of Brooklyn, who had been visiting a friend at the Colonial Houses the night of the shootings, was held in $50,000 bail as a material witness. Young Lee was spoken to by the killers after they had slain the patrolmen and was told, in effect, to mind his own business. He was hostile toward the detectives who questioned him and was clearly in fear either of the killers or the police. Although the police were careful not to say that Mr. Lee had actually seen the killing, it was known that he had come face to face with the gunmen. The decision to hold him as a material wit ness was made on the ground that the young man was “frightened and terrorized” and might flee the city. Mr. Lee was held, first in civil jail, then in a hotel un til he was released in the care of his grandparents in Brooklyn. He is still a mate rial witness under police guard. The ballistics tests, mean time, on the bullets used in the shootings were incon clusive. Until the actual weapons are found and bul lets are fired from them no comparisan can be made to those in the laboratory. It is even impossible to tell which bullet came from the patrol men's own guns. There was a time when the ballistic characteristics of policemen's guns were on file with the department. Sev eral years ago, however, it was discovered that the characteristics changed after repeated test firings and thus the records were frequently inaccurate. There are no rec ords of patrolmen's guns now kept. Another move taken by the Police Department in the case was an effort to in crease the reward money to be paid for information lead ing to the arrest and convic tion of the killers. Chief Seedman was instrumental in these efforts to raise a large sum of money. The reward is now up to $51 000, a sum contributed by police groups, the Conservative party and a number of corporations. On Friday night, May 28, there was another flurry of excitement when a man who resembled the composite drawing of the person who had delivered the license plates, the .45‐caliber bullet and the message to The New York Times was picked up in Harlem. This, of course, had to do with the machine‐gun ning, but detectives working the double homicide were in volved because of any pos sible connection between the cases. A security guard from The Times, however, could not identify the man as the courier. A week passed during which the teams of detectives chased down telephone tips, sought out informers and gen erally cursed the lack of solid leads. Then, early in the morning of Saturday, June 5, four men were arrested in the Bronx in an attempted hold up of a black social club. Two of the suspects—Rich ard Moore and Edward Josephs — were defendants who had jumped bail in the bombing conspiracy of 13 Black Panthers that had ended in their acquittals the month before. Seized with the four was an arsenal of weapons that included a hand gronadse, a .45‐caliber submachine gun, a double‐barreled shotgun, a 12‐ gauge shotgun, an automatic rifle, a .45‐caliber automatic and two handguns. After a day of questioning the suspects at the Bathgate Avenue police station in the Bronx, the police indicated that Moore and Josephs had been linked with the machine gun wounding of the two patrolmen on May 19. That night, at the arraign ment of the four men, Rich ard Schaeffer, an assistant district attorney, said that, in addition to the machine gun attack, two of the suspects were under investigation for the murders. In asking that all four be held without bail, Mr. Schaef fer told Judge Aloysius Melia that “there are facts in con nection with the homicide that I cannot divulge.” The next morning, how ever, Chief Seedman disputed the court statement, saying that “there is no connection at this time between these men and the murderers of the two patrolmen.” “We will crack this case.” Chief Seedman said recent ly when it appeared the in vestigation was slowing down. “It may take time and it will take patience, but we will find the killers.”

1413-> ALLENDE DECREES EMERGENCY RULE AS RIOTS CONTINUE
SANTIAGO, Chile, Dec. 2—The army assumed control of public order today in this capital after more than 150 persons had been injured in violence set off by a women's protest march against the Government. President Salvadore Allende Gossens met with the National Security Council and decreed state of emergency. Street skirmishes between Marxist and anti‐Marxist youths, which broke out last night during the women's “March of the Empty Pots,” continued this morning. Carabineers, the national police, acting under the orders of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, commander of the Santiago army garrison, fired scores of teargas grenades and arrested more than 100 rock‐throwing youths. Traffic in central streets was disrupted and stores closed their steel shutters. The Minister of the Interior, José Tohá, announced in a ‘televised statement that Chile's left‐wing Government was facing an “upsurge of sedition” by the anti‐Marxist opposition led by the Christian Democratic and National parties. Mr. Tohá closed down indefinitely the two major opposition radio stations, Radio Balmaceda and Radio Agricultura, which broadcast repeated calls yesterday for women to take part in the march to protest food shortages and the visit here of Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba. General Pinochet, who was put in charge of all internal security forces, prohibited all street assemblies. The order prevented a scheduled march by anti‐Marxist students, but did not interfere with a farewell rally for Mr. Castro, attended by Dr. Allende, at the National Stadium. Dr. Allende said at the rally that “the germs of fascism” were at work in Chile. “I respect the opposition as long as it remains within the law, but I know very well how to distinguish between opposition and sedition,” he told crowd of about 40,000. Dr. Allende said that it was a “strange coincidence” that street demonstrations here had broken out at the same time as newspapers in the United States published reports that aides of President Nixon who recently visited Latin America believed “that the days of the popular government of Chile are numbered.” Mr. Castro followed Dr. Allende to the rostrum and said diet in Chile he had seen fascism in action. “Reaction is much more developed and experienced in Chile than it was in Cuba when we took power,” he declared. Mr. Castro said that his three weeks in Chile had left him with the impression that the possibility of counterrevolution existed here “because of weaknesses in the ideological struggle, in the mobilization of the masses and in the unification of the revolutionary forces.” “The question here is whether the popular forces will learn faster from the revolutionary process than the reactionaries,” he said. Newspapers and radio stations were warned by General Pinochet that they would be shut down if they published or broadcast “alarmist information.” The police patrolled bus, railroad and air terminals. “The caribineers have orders to allow no street demonstrations by anyone, and I don't care if their political color is red, blue, yellow or green,” said General Pinochet at a news conference. “I hope the army does not have to come out because if they do it will be to kill,” added the general. He explained that soldiers did not have the crowd‐control weapons of the police. While the pro‐Government rally met at the National Stadium, about 10,000 shopkeepers, farmers, provincial merchants, bankers, and industrialists jammed Caupolicán Stadium, Santiago's Madison Square Garden. This meeting of the private Sector, called to protest governmental measures that have affected small‐businessmen and farmers, whistled derisively each time Dr. Allende's name was mentioned by speakers. “Send him away with Fidel!” they chanted repeatedly. Mr. Castro is scheduled to fly home to Havana Saturday with stopovers in Lima, Peru, and Guayaquil, Ecuador. Anti‐Marxists were clearly satisfied with the women's march. More than 5,000 women took part, beating pots and pans to protest food shortages until the police used tear gas against them to prevent march on the presidential palace. “The Government knows that we cannot be intimidated by these thugs,” said a housewife who marched yesterday and who was weeping from tear gas. By “thugs” she meant not the police, but the bands of youths from the extremist let‐wing Revolutionary Left Movement and the Communist party's Ramona Parra Youth Brigade named for a Communist girl killed in street fighting in 1945. Another Christian DemoCratic woman said that she had been stopped today by a carabineer carrying a submachine gun who had asked her if she had demonstrated yesterday. She said that when she replied that she had, the carabineer said: “Keep it up, we are with you.” The suspension of the march by anti‐marxist university students did not prevent Dr. Edgardo Boeninger, rector of the University of Chile, from reading before a cheering crowd of students and professors a proclamation of a plebiscite to be held Dec. 21 on maintaining or deposing the present University Council, which is con trolled by pro‐Government, Marxists.

1414-> MISS FRACCI TAKES LEAD IN ‘PAQUITA’
American Ballet Theater's current production of “Paquita” saw Carla Fracci taking the fe male lead Thursday night for the first time during the current State Theater season. The di vertissement, constructed as it is for flashing showcase virtu osity, does not show Miss Fracci in her best light. As an artist of mood and deli cacy she finds herself enveloped with choreography that has been stylistically fashioned for someone of more exhibitionistic temperament. Where Miss Frac ci instinctively seeks for the nuance or the modulated in flection in creating a role, she finds in “Paquita” a part that demands broad sweeps of high energy gesture. Her attempt at creating a characterization with such alien emphasis, though val iant, is not entirely convincing. Beneath the grossness of the restaging of the work lurk ele ments of the classically re strained choreography that orig inally were the style of the bal let. It is for these elements that Miss Fracci reaches, but they are too few for her to success fully build a part. For better or—I am afraid—for worse, the current choreography will only yield its gaudy self to more flamboyant temperaments. The evening also included “Pe trushka,” Pillar of Fire” and “Fancy Free.”

1415-> Two Paper Companies in State Get Federal Pollution Mandate
The Federal Environmental Protection Agency moved against two large New York State paper companies yesterday in the first step of a major new program that will take over pollution control activities from what are considered lagging state efforts. The companies — Patrician Paper of South Glens Falls and the Brown Paper Company of Castleton‐on‐Hudson—had been under state orders to clean up their pollution by July 1 of last year, 18 months ago. According to Gus J. Bennett, regional director of enforcement for the Federal agency, neither has yet moved to clean up the pollution and the Federal Government has now put them under so‐called 180‐day orders. This means if they do not come up with acceptable pollution plans within that time, they could be taken to court and shut down. 120 Tons of Tissue Paper The Patrician Company produces about 120 tons of tissue paper every day, and, according to Mr. Bennett, discharges 1.5 million gallons of waste water a day into the Hudson River. The Brown Company discharges about the same amount of waste water into Moordener Kill, a tributary of the Hudson, in the process of producing 100 tons of paperboard every day. The new Federal program is based on putting pressure on all corporations in a specific industry throughout the region so that no one corporation can say it is being singled out for specific attack while its competitors are let go free. The new Federal program will be brought to bear against all corporations in the region that includes New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The approach may later be extended to other regions. In this region the critical industries were determined to be (1) pulp and paper, (2) chemical, (3) petro chemical and (4) those industries that have fermentation waste, especially breweries and pharmaceutical plants. In the case of the two companies put on notice today, Mr. Bennett said he hoped to be able to come to an agreement on pollution control well within the 180 day period. There has been concern In some quarters about moving too hard against companies when the economy is faltering because of the fear of putting plants out of business and adding to the unemployment rolls. But Mr. Bennett said the recession had also provided a benefit in that he had been able to hire for his staff some environmental specialists who had been dismissed by corporations in economy moves.

1416-> Pompidou Predicts Entry for Britain In Common Market
PARIS, Jan. 4—President Pompidou predicted today that Britain would be accepted into the Common Market because her membership was now in the interests of France and Eu rope, as well as Britain. Under President de Gaulle, British applications to join the six‐nation trade bloc, now in the process of forming a deeper economic union, was vetoed twice. Mr. Pompidou's statement came at an informal press gathering as France assumed the chairmanship for the next six months of the market's Council of Ministers in Brus sels. It was the most encourag ing statement yet made by the French President on British en try prospects. Britain has been negotiating with the Council of Ministers for the last six months. This body is made up of the Foreign Ministers of the six market members — France, West Ger many, Italy, Belgium, the Neth erlands and Luxembourg—and is the block's highest decision making authority. Although Mr. Pompidou did not go into the reasons France now thinks it is in her interest for the British to join, the view in diplomatic circles is that France now feels the need of Britain as a counterweight to a more politically independent West Germany. General de Gaulle had constructed his pol icies around close Paris‐Bonn relations. Economic reasons also count. Britain is the world's biggest food importer. France is the largest supplier of food in the Common Market. Because Brit ain would have to buy more food from the Continent under the conditions of entry, French farmers stand to benefit hand somely.

1417-> Letters
To THE EDITOR: Dr. Maliver's article on en counter groups makes some highly legitimate points, in particular the dangers of un trained leaders making use of the very powerful encounter techniques. However, it seems to me that the article places undue emphasis on these dangers in comparison to the values of the encounter ap proach, not only as an ad junct to conventional psycho therapy but as a growth experience for “normal” people. More specifically, I would like to correct the statement quoted in the article to the effect that I accept for par ticipation in marathons only people who are currently in treatment with a reputable psychotherapist. This policy would imply that I regard the marathon as potentially so upsetting as to be unsafe for people not currently in treat ment—an opinion which I definitely do not hold.

1418-> Nixon to Ask Federal Purchase of Big Cypress Swamp in Florida
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23 —President Nixon announced today that he would soon send to Congress a bill authorizing Federal acquisition of 547,000 acres in the Big Cypress Swamp in southern Florida that are now privately owned. The President said Federal acquisition was necessary to protect the swamp “from private development that would destroy it” and thereby destroy also much of south Florida's water supply and the Everglades National Park. The unique life systems of the Everglades National Park depend largely on two watersheds—that flowing out of Lake Okeechobee and that flowing from the Big Cypress Swamp. The President's announcement came just a week before Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington, chairman of the Senate Interior Committee and an announced candidate for the Democratic Presidential nom. ination, was to open hearings in Miami on a bill to establish a Big Cypress national recre ation area through Federal purchase of the land. The author of this bill, which was introduced last August, is Senator Lawton M. Chiles Jr., Democrat of Florida. It has 11 other sponsors, all Democrats, including Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota and Mr. Jackson. Senator Muskie, although he has not formally announced his candidacy, is regarded as the front‐runner now for the Democratic nomination; Mr. Jackson has already announced, and Mr. Humphrey is expected to do so in the new year. At a White House news conference today, Rogers C. B, Morton, Secretary of the Interior, was asked why the Administration did not simply support the Chiles‐Jackson bill, Hp replied: “This is our program here, We've been working on it a long time. Everybody else ought to endorse it.” An aide to Senator Chiles said that after the Senator proposed Federal acquisition of the swamp to Secretary Morton last spring, the Interior Department suggested several alternatives to outright purchase of the land, including the securing of easements from private landowners and the acquiring of water rights. When asked today about these earlier proposals, Secretary Morton said that the Administration's “primary program is to acquire the real estate,” but that it might also consider acquiring easements or water rights in the property. Mr. Morton said that it would take “considerably in excess of $100‐million” and 10 years to acquire the land now owned by 21,000 individuals, real estate companies and businesses. Senator Chiles said today: “I'm delighted that the Administration has come around to our concept of buying this watershed area. It is the only real route to preserving and protecting the area and at the same time being fair to the landowners.” He also said that the President's support of the ChilesJackson project would “enhance the success of the hearings” scheduled for next Tuesday. Except for some early opposition from land developers, which has largely dissipated, Senator Chiles said that reaction to the Chiles‐Jackson bill had been “overwhelmingly favorable” in Florida. Senator Jackson had no immediate comment, but an Interior Committee staff member said that the Senator would welcome the President's support. “The reason we decided to hold hearings,” the aide said, “was to get the Administration to take a stand.” President Nixon said that his bill would provide that, following acquisition, the Federal Government would enter into an agreement with the State of Florida for the management of what is to be called “Big Cypress National Fresh Water Reserve.” Mr. Nixon said that the acquisition of Big Cypress, 70 miles west of Miami, would “mark the fourth time this Administration has taken steps to protect the unique natural resources of south Florida.” He listed the following: the halting of the jetport that was under construction in Big Cypress; the 1970 Rivers and Harbors Act which assured an adequate water supply to the eastern portion of the Everglades National Park; the halting, by court action, of threatened damage to the Biscayne National Monument from thermal pollution from new power plants.

1419-> Ex‐City Commissioner Is Fined For Filing 2 Tax Returns Late
Vincent A. G. O'Connor, a lawyer who formerly served as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan and as the city's Commissioner of Marine and Aviation, was fined $1,000 in Federal Court here yesterday for failing to file his income tax returns on time for two years. Another lawyer, Max Shen ghit of Brooklyn, was fined $11, 250 in a separate case for using false affidavits to obtain default judgments against customers with overdue hills from Macy's, Gimbels, Altman's, Abraham & Straus and the Hertz Corpora tion. Both lawyers escaped pos sible jail sentences after they had pleaded guilty to the Fed eral charges against them, but they could be subjected to dis ciplinary action by the bar as sociation. Mr. O'Connor, who lives at 200 East 66th Street, was charged with “unlawfully, will fully and knowingly” failing to file the required tax returns on gross income of $80,000 in 1965 and $67,000 in 1966. The 56‐year‐old defendant conceded that he had failed to file his tax returns for the two years until after tax officials investigated his failure, but he contended that “family illness and other pressures” had pre vented him from filing on time. Judge Inzer B. Wyatt, who could have sentenced Mr. O'Con nor to a year in jail and $10,000 in fines on each of the two counts against him, said that he was taking account of the defendant's “long and honor able service” by limiting the penalty to a fine and a one day suspended sentence. Mr. O'Connor, who was an assistant District Attorney here from 1945 to 1954, served as Commissioner of Marine and Aviation from 1954 to 1962 in the administration of Mayor Robert F. Wagner. In the case of Mr. Shenghit, who lives at 2334 East 64th Street in Brooklyn, Judge John M. Cannella imposed a fine of $750 on each of the 15 counts against the defendant for using false affidavits to collect bills. Judge Cannella, who could have sentenced Mr. Shenghit to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine on each of the counts, said that no further penalty was needed against the 64‐year‐old defend ant but that other bill collec tors should be deterred from using false affidavits. Mr. Shenghit admitted that he had filed false affidavits about the military status of debtors when he knew his process server had not talked with them as claimed in the affidavits.

1420-> Smith Beats Kodes for U.S. Open Title
Stan Smith, a rejected ball boy, won the United States Open tennis championship yes terday. The second‐seeded Califor nian, currently serving a two‐ year tour of duty in the Army, put down the grass‐court he roics of Jan Kodes, the unseed ed, 25‐year‐old Czech, 3.6, 6‐3, 6‐2, 7‐6, before a crowd of 12,879 at the West Side Ten nis Club in Forest Hills, Queens. The women's singles final, also delayed three days by rain, went to top‐seeded Mrs. Billie Jean King, who beat sec ond‐seeded Rosemary Casals, her keenest rival on the tour, 6‐4, 7‐6, for the ninth time in 10 meetings this year. It was the first time in 16 years that Americans had swept the singles titles. Smith's victory was the fin est achievement in a career that has brought continued ar tistic improvement. With this ti tle and as runner‐up to John Newcombe at Wimbledon ear lier the angualr, 6‐foot‐4‐inch blond must be considered among the top three or four players in the world, perhaps behind Newcombe, Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall. Such status is a far cry from that gloomy day a dec ade ago when Smith, an am bitiou§ junior, offered his serv ices as a bellboy for a Davis Cup match, but was turned down because officials thought he was too clumsy to run across the court and pick up balls. Yesterday he moved on the lawn in the stadium with the controlled grace of an athlete who had spent long, perhaps frustrating hours jumping rope and exercising to improve his balance, coordination and tim ing. He leaned into returns of serves with adroit skill, was impeccable on the difficult half volley and managed 68 per cent of his first serves (66 of 97), with enough diversity to thwart his rival's potent pass ing game. “I changed strategy after the first set,” the mustachioed victor said, sipping champagne sent by his racquet manufac turer. “I was serving hard in the first set, and he was hitting everything back. So I slowed it down and tried to hop the ball on the grass.” The contrast of Smith's range and power with Kodes's tena cious talents off the ground made for an exciting, well played match despite four serv ice breaks in the fourth set. Early in the second set, the players hit five successive win ners on returns of serves, volleys, and shots from difficult angles. Smith broke Kodes for 2‐1 in the third set off a short second serve, which he ran around to take on his forehand and hammer cross‐court for winner. “I was feeling very tired” said Kodes, who needed five sets to beat Ashe in the semi finals on Tuesday and perhaps felt the effects of a hot, mid afternoon sun. “My serve was very weak.” Kodes converted 62 per cent of his first serves. But Smith demonstrated in the 12th game of the fourth set, and again in the tiebreaker for the match that his serve had precision and power. Serving at 5–6 in a tense stadium, Smith carried the game at love without hitting a volley. The last 3 points were an unreturnahie flat serve deep, to Kodes's forehand and two aces, the second or which took a bad bounce, bolstering the Czech's contention that grass courts might not be the joke he thought they were, but that grass is grass, you know. Smith and Kodes had won four tiebreaker sets apiece dur ing the tournament. “The tiebreaker really de nands a different technique,” said Smith, whose concentra tion on the court is another outstanding trademark. “You have to change your thinking.” Kodes won the first 2 points of the tiebreaker on serve. Smith put in a spin‐serve ace for 1–2, but the trim, inspired Czech slapped a fore‐hand cross court winner. Leading by 3‐1 and with an opportunity to win the 5‐of‐9 point playoff and the set on service, Kodes lost the next 2 points. More specifically, Smith won them. The Californian again ran around his backhand on Kodes's second serve and slapped a forehand winner cross — court. Then he answered the Czech's best flat first serve with an other cross‐court return for winner, this time off the back hand. Mrs. King had not won tournament in the metropolitan area since 1967. The only match she had lost to Miss Casals this year was in an indoor tournament here. Billie Jean had said she was eager for this year's Open after having watched last year's as a spectator, the result of knee surgery. Miss Casals carried her be spectacled doubles partner to a tiebreaker in the second set, the only time in the tournament that Mrs. King had seemed in jeopardy of losing a set. Billie Jean won the tiebreaker, 5‐2, and the match. She earned $5,000 in prize money, $2,500 in travel al lowance and a new car She needs less than $20,000 to be come the first woman athlete to top $100,000 in a year. The 24‐year‐old Smith said that his $15,000 winner's check would be deposited with the Davis Cup fund. He also got $5,000 for expenses. Since his parents in Pasa dena, Calif., recently sold his old Mustang, Smith said he hoped to keep his new cham pionship car, a Ford Torino. Smith and Erik Van Dillen, who may play the doubles in the Davis Cup challenge round against Rumania next month in Charlotte, N. C., lost a close battle in the doubles final to Newcombe and Roger Taylor of Britain. Playing into darkness, the teams split four sets, then agreed to settle the match and $2,000 first prize with a tie breaker game. The scores were 6–7, 6‐3, 7‐6, 4–6, 5 points to 3.

1421-> Nixon Submits Plan to Merge 9 Volunteer Programs
WASHINGTON, March 24—After weeks of internal infighting, President Nixon unveiled today a general plan for merging the Peace Corps, VISTA and seven other voluntary service programs. The merger would centrelize management of 15,000 full‐time and 10,000 part‐time volunteers, young and old, foreign and domestic. The new agency's budget of 176.3.million equals the combined budgets of the nine present agencies plus $20‐million for innovation. If Congress concurs in the plan, the core of the new agency would be established by July 1. Inclusion of the Teacher Corps would then be proposed in separate legislation. In a special message sent to Congress, Mr. Nixon today called for still larger future efforts. “America must enlist the Ideals, the energy, the experience and the skills of its people on a larger scald than It ever has in the past,” he said. The twice‐delayed Presidential message did not offer answers to a series of issues that arose during the extended internal Administration debate aver the merger. Uncertainty extended even to the name of the new agency. Formally, it is labeled “Action, but officials today insisted that it would be called the “Action Corps.” They also wee uncertain whether the names VISTA and Peace Corps would continue to be used for components of the agency. The President first offered the merger idea in a Jan. 14 speech at the University of Nebraska. Two distinct contra versies quickly developed. One was over the future of VISTA‐ Volunteers in Service to America, some 4,000 young people engaged in urban and rural antipoverty work. An out line of the merger plan that way recently circulated by the White House called for dissolution of VISTA into several new corps only partly related to poverty work. This intent was denied today at a White House press briefing by Joseph Blatchford, the Peace Corps director, whom President Nixon has designated to head Action. VISTA's present poverty efforts, he said, would “not only [be] maintained, but expanded.” He said he foresaw “many, many more volunteers” working in the same areas of concern as both the Peace Corps and VISTA. The second controversy was over inclusion of the Teacher Carps in the new agency. Officials of the Office of Education, where the Teacher Corps is now located, resisted Mr. Blatchford's conclusion that the corps should be transferred. As had been expected, Mr. Nixon proposed today what one official described as “a subtle compromise.” The Teacher Corps will not be included in the first phase of the reorganization plan. Rather, Mr. Nixon said, transfer of the Teacher Corps will be proposed hi legislation if Congress concurs in the first phase of reorganization. A reorganization plan takes effect automatically unless either house of Congress oh. jests within 60 legislative days. Such plans customarily are successful. There is no such limit on consideration of leg. islation, which requires affirmative action by both houses. Congressional experts said today they foresaw little difficulty for the reorganization plan, which Mr. Nixon sent to Congress with his message today. But the outlook for the Inter Teacher Corps bill, they said; is substantial controversy. versy. “The reorganization plan, is not an issue most people care enough to. oppose the President on,” one staff member said. “But as for the Teacher Corps, well, at a minimum, there are some very strong, supporters who will vigorously oppose the legislation.” Mr. Nixon's reorganization plan would consolidate these six present volunteer agencies: ¶VISTA and a small special program, with a combined budget of 33.1‐million, from the Office of Economic Opportunity. ¶Foster Grandparents, with a $7.5‐million budget, and the Retired Senior Volunteer Program ($5‐million), from the De partment of Health, Education and Welfare. ¶The Service Corps of Retired Executives and the Active Corps of Executives, with a combined budget of $1.8‐million, from the Small Business Administration. When the reorganization plan goes into effect, the President said, he will transfer the Peace Corps, whose budget is $71.2‐million, and the small Office of Voluntary Action, to Action. The third phase of the Action merger would be submission of the legislation to transfer the Teacher Corps, whose budget is $33.4‐million. Administration officials gave two explanations for following the legislative, rather than reorganization, course with the Teacher Crops. Mr. Blatchford said at today's briefing that the President felt it was better to let Congress debate the question more fully. Richard P. Nathan of the Office of Management and Budget added that the Administration also wished to propose some amendments to the basic Teacher Corps legislation. In his message, Mr. Nixon briefly traced the rapid enlargement of Government volunteer programs in recent years. Their proliferation, he said, was “perhaps inevitable,” but he added: “The foundation for a greatly expanded Government contribution to volunteer services already exists. Now we must consolidate that foundation in order to build on it.”

1422-> HOUSING INDUSTRY SEES STRONG YEAR
HOUSTON, Jan. 17 — This will be a good year for housing, the president of the National Association of Home Builders said here today. Louis R. Barbar, head of the trade organization holding its convention here, said that about 1.7 million homes would be built in the nation this year. This would compare with an estimated 1,425,000 units com pleted in 1970, for an increase of some 21 per cent. It would be the most units produced in any year since 1950, when 1.9 million units were built. But 1.7 million units would be far below the average of 2.6 mil lion homes deemed necessary by the Government to be built during the nineteen‐seventies to meet the nation's housing needs. “We're ready to revise that estimate upward some,” Mr. Barbar said, because of the re cently lowered mortgage in terest rates and the expected slight upswing to the economy. Last year, Mr. Barbar noted, he had predicted that housing construction in 1970 would reach 1.8 million units. “I should have said the annual rate would have reached that level by the end of the year, which it did,” he said. Mr. Barbar expressed optin mism for the housing industry, not only in 1971 but also for the rest of the decade. He pointed to a reason for his op timism hi relating that pur chases of housing in November climbed 29 per cent above the 1969 level for the month. The recent lowering of mortgage interest rates, he said, brought more than three million addi tional families into the housing market because they could not qualify for loans, he said. Mr. Barbar said he did not recommend nor did he think consumers would delay housing purchases in the hope of fur ther declines in interest rates. American consumers are more sophisticated today than ever before, Mr. Barbar said, and would “recognize that infla tion, is not going to be com pletely licked.” He said: “They recognize that inflation is a basic fact in the cost of housing. They recognize that other factors in the cost —land and labor—are not go ing to come down.” Mr. Barbar indicated disa greement with the recent ac tion of George Romney, Secre tary of Housing and Urban De velopment, in ending a Federal subsidy program for low‐cost housing because of alleged frauds by contractors. “I certainly wouldn't kill the program because of some abuses of some,” Mr. Barbar said. “It is the only singular program that would provide housing for low and medium income families. There is no other major program.” In answer to a question, Mr. Barbar said there was no way he could evaluate Operation Breakthrough, the Government's program to encourage new house‐building techniques. But he added: “Early indications were that we were going to get into new technologies that would reduce cost as much as 25 per cent. I don't think they're saying that anymore.” Mr. Barbar remarked: ‘If you put the cost of a house at zero, all the other factors will still account for 75 per cent of your monthly payments. I mean such things as taxes, insurance, land costs.” In a speech at today's open ing session of the five‐day con vention, which has attracted some 50,000 delegates, Mayor Joseph L. Alioto of San Fran cisco proposed a Government program that he said would re duce interest rates on home mortgages and “clear the way for many thousands of low‐to‐ moderate income Americans to own their own homes.”

1423-> By Lyndon B.Johnson: '68 Election and Final White House Days
IF I had to pic date that sym bolized the turmoil we experienced throughout 1968, I think Jan. 23 would be the day—the morning the U.S.S. Pueblo was seized. The Pueblo incident formed the first link in a chain of events—of crisis, tragedy and dis appointment—that added up to one of the most agonizing years any President has ever spent in the White House. The Pueblo, a highly sophisticated electronics intelligence ship, had been cruising off the coast of North Korea gathering data from the mainland. Be tween 10:52 P.M. of Jan. 22 and 12:32 A.M. of the 23d, Washington time, the Pueblo was challenged and then sur rounded by a flotilla comprised of a North Korean submarine chaser and three patrol boats, and was finally boarded by an armed party, while Com munist jet fighters circled overhead. The Pueblo reported that the boarding took place approximately 15½ nautical miles from the nearest land under North Korean jurisdiction, well outside the 12‐mile territorial limit claimed by North Korea. Aboard the ship were 6 officers, 75 enlisted men and 2 civilians. Four men were injured, one mortally. The ship was virtually unarmed and unprotected. This fact prompted former Vice President Richard Nixon to term the Pueblo incident a “tactical blun der,” but there were good reasons for the lack of cover. The cost of provid ing military protection for all our sea and air intelligence operations would have been prohibitively expensive, and under any circumstances such armed protection so close to their shores would have been provocative to foreign governments. The unanswered question was why the North Koreans had seized the Pueb lo. Piracy on the high seas is a serious matter. Why had North Korea flagrant ly risked stirring up an international hornet's nest and perhaps starting a war? The North Koreans charged that the Pueblo had violated their territorial wa ters. They claimed that they had seized the ship only seven miles offshore. We had proof that this charge was false, not only from the Pueblo's reports, but from our own radio “fix” on the ship at the time of the incident. We did not know, of course, whether the ship had inadvertently drifted too close to shore before it was challenged, but we considered this possibility unlikely. The Pueblo was under strict orders to stay well outside the territorial limits, and given the sensitive mission it was con ducting, we doubted that the captain and the crew would be so careless. What did the North Koreans hope to accomplish? Our best estimate, then, one that I believe holds up well in the light of subsequent events, is that they were aware of the Tet offensive in Vietnam, which was scheduled to take place eight days later. They were trying to divert U.S. military resources from Vietnam and to pressure the South Koreans into recall ing their two divisions from that area, for the seizure of the Pueblo was not an isolated incident. The number of border violations and flare‐ups along the 38th Parallel in Korea had in creased sharply in the previous weeks. As a result, South Korea was nerv ous and was seriously considering withdrawing military units from Viet nam to build up defensive strength at home. One of our first actions after the Pueblo incident was to dispatch more than 350 aircraft to our air bases in South Korea and to recall to active duty selected units of the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve to re place our strategic reserve in the Unit ed States. In response, the North Koreans promptly announced that the crew of the Pueblo would be tried and punished as criminals. This announcement point ed up our dilemma. We could not al low our indignation to dictate our re sponse, even though that is the course many Americans would have preferred. We knew that if we wanted our men to return home alive, we had to use diplomacy. If we resorted to military means, we could expect dead bodies. And we also might start a war. In spite of every effort we could make, in spite of our patient attempts to balance firmness with reason, and in spite of our innumerable diplomatic moves, 11 miserable months went by before the men of the Pueblo were given their freedom. Every day that passed during those 11 months, the plight of those men obsessed and haunt ed me. MARCH was a month of profound political frustrations. I was de laying announcement of my de cision not to be a Presidential candidate in 1968. That delay resulted in several misunderstandings and disappointments, the most obvious of which was the New Hampshire primary of March 12 I must admit that the results surprised me. I was not expecting a landslide. I had not spent a single day campaigning in New Hampshire and my name was not even on the ballot. And the fact that I received more votes, as a write‐in candidate, than Senator McCarthy—49.5 per cent as against 42.4 per cent— seems to have been overlooked or for gotten. Still, I think most people were surprised that Senator McCarthy rolled up the vote he did. I was much less surprised when Bobby Kennedy an nounced his candidacy four days later. I had been expecting it. For a few fleeting hours on April 3 I thought that history had turned a corner and that the “bad days” were behind us. Hanoi responded favorably to my March 31 speech and announced that its representatives were ready to meet with us. I felt deep satisfaction in the knowledge that by refusing to be a candidate for the Presidency, I might have hastened the day when peace would come to Vietnam. But satisfaction turned to sorrow in less than 24 hours. On April 4 Martin Luther King Jr. was slain by a sniper and it became immedi ately clear that his assassination had compounded the danger of violence. I postponed my planned Vietnam confer ence in Hawaii and went on television to appeal to reason. On June 5, while we were still re covering from the shock of Dr. King's assassination, Senator Robert Kennedy was shot and killed in Los Angeles on the night of his California primary vic tory over Senator McCarthy. Another voice that spoke for America's poor and dispossessed was stilled forever. When tragedy struck him down, I was glad that my last meeting with Bobby Kennedy had been friendly. That meeting had been the result of a public promise I had made, following my an nouncement that I would not accept the Democratic nomination, to brief all the major Presidential candidates. Sen ator Kennedy had asked to see me and I immediately arranged a meeting with him in the White House. Shortly after 10 A.M. on April 3 he came into the Cabinet Room with his campaign aide Ted Sorensen and met with Walt Ros tow, Charles Murphy and me for more than an hour. The discussion was an open and frank one. Both Murphy and Rostow took notes. The following notes reflect the tenor of that session: The President opened the meeting by referring to his speech of March 31, in which he announced the new initia tive with respect to Vietnam and his intention not to run for re‐election. He said that he wished and hoped to find areas of agreement because of the crit ical need to do so in the national in terest. He referred to the critical nature of problems facing us and spoke par ticularly of the explosive situation in the Middle East and of our fiscal and monetary problems. He told Senator Kennedy he had no desire to be a po litical boss or to determine the Sena tor's future.… The President said that he would have his own judgments and would ex ercise them, but except for a few fund raising dinners, he planned to keep out of campaign politics. Senator Kennedy—Your speech was magnificent. I regret we have not had closer contact. Will be glad to try to help in minimizing controversy and to keep in touch through anyone you say. Your position is unselfish and coura geous and, taken in the interest of the United States.… The President—Feel free to talk to Murphy, Rostow or DeVier Pierson. I'll be glad to meet with you at any time. Senator Kennedy—Thank you very much. Can I ask about the political situation? Where do I stand in the cam paign? Are you opposed to my effort and will you marshal forces against me? The President—I expressed it in my speech. I want to keep the Presidency out of this campaign. I'm not that pure, but I am that scared. The situation of the country is critical. I will try to run this office so as to have as much support and as few problems as possible. I will tell the Vice President about the same things I'm telling you. I don't know whether he will run or not. If he asks my advice, I won't give it.… Senator Kennedy—If you decide later on to take a position, can we talk to you prior to that? The President—Yes, unless I lose my head and pop off. I will try to honor your request. The President told Senator Kennedy that he held no enmity for him. He said frankly that he felt much closer to the Vice President, who had been everything the President could ask as Vice President.… President Kennedy had always treat ed him well as Vice President, although he spoke very frankly and sometimes sharply. He had done his best as Vice President to support President Kenne dy. (Senator Kennedy agreed.) He had done his best since then to carry on the policies and programs. He thought he had done reasonably well.… Nevertheless, the President said, what he had done had not been good enough, Witness our current difficulties.… The next man who sits in this chair will have to do better. Senator Kennedy—You are a brave and dedicated man. That was the last time I saw Senator Kennedy. THE resignation of Chief Justice Earl Warren in June represented a dou ble blow to me. His departure from the Court deprived the nation of the services of a man whom I consid ered one of the great Supreme Court Justices in our history and resulted in the deliberate and systematic vilifica tion of one of the wisest, ablest, and fairest men I have ever known, Asso ciate Justice Abe Fortas, The irony of that episode was that Abe Fortas had never wanted to sit on the Supreme Court in the first place. The events leading to his appoint ment began on the afternoon of July 16, 1965, when Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith and his wife visited me in the Oval Office. During our conversa tion, Galbraith said that he believed Arthur Goldberg, then an Associate Jus tice on the Court, would step down from his position to take a job that would be more challenging to him. Three days later Justice Goldberg flew to Illinois with me to attend Am bassador Stevenson's funeral. I men tioned that I had heard reports that he might step down from the Court and therefore might be available for another assignment. He told me these reports had substance. I said that I would like to see him in the Cabinet as Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare because that was a department which required imagination and leader ship at the top. He replied that the job sounded fascinating but that he had become increasingly interested in for eign affairs. That was the extent of our conversa tion that day. I asked Justice Goldberg to “think about it some more” and said that we would discuss it later. The next day he called Jack Valenti and told him that the job he would accept was the U.N. ambassadorship, if I offered it to him. I appointed him to the United Nations and I felt he was an excellent choice. Subsequently I nominated Abe Fortas to fill the vacant seat on the Court. I was confident that the man would be a brilliant and able jurist. He had the experience and the liberalism to espouse the causes that both I and Arthur Goldberg believed in. He had the strength of character to stand up for his own convictions, and he was humanitarian. Abe Fortas, reared in Memphis, Tenn., with a career as distinguished lawyer in Washington for over 30 years, did not want the job. I urged him to accept the nomination but he declined firmly. He said that he did not want it. Then, on July 19, he wrote me: For the President: Again, my dear friend, I am obligated and honored by your confidence and generosity—to an extent which is beyond my power adequately to acknowledge. But after painful searching, I've decided to decline—with a heart full of gratitude. Carol thinks I should accept this greatest honor that a lawyer could receive—this highest appointive post in the na tion. But I want a few more years of activity. I want a few more years to try to be of service to you and the Johnson family. And I want and feel that in justice I should take a few more years to stabilize this law firm in the in terests of the young men who have enlisted here. This has been a hard decision— but not nearly as hard as another which had the virtue of continuing association with your trials and tribulations and greatness. I shall always be grateful. We talked about the matter for the next several days, but I could not sway him. Finally, on July 28, I invited Fortas to my office. When he came in, I told him that I was about to go over to the theater in the East Wing of the White House to announce his appointment to the Supreme Court. I said that he could stay in my office or accompany me to the theater, but that since he was the person being appointed, I thought he should go with me. He looked at me in silence for a moment. I waited. Then he said, “I'll accompany you.” That was the only way I managed to get him on the Court. When I nominated Fortas to succeed Chief Justice Warren three years later, I did so for the same reasons I had first appointed him to the Court. Ed Weisl Sr., a friend and an out standing New York lawyer, reported that Senator Richard Russell had in formed him that although he would vote for Fortas for Chief Justice, he would “enthusiastically' support” Judge Homer Thornberry [of Texas] if he were nom inated to the Court. I thought that Russell's stand would provide strong insurance against a Southern filibuster opposing Justice Fortas. I called Senator Russell to the White House on June 25 and sought his coun sel firsthand. He repeated what he had told Ed Weisl. On June 26, 1968, I announced my intention to send the nominations of Abe Fortas and Homer Thornberry to the Senate. In the end, Abe Fortas's chief assets —his progressive philosophy, his love of country, his frank views always spo ken from the heart and his service to his President—brought his downfall. I had my first inkling of trouble after I called Senator James Eastland, chair man of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and asked him to come and see me. I recounted my conversation with Senator Russell, hoping that the judg ment of that respected Southerner would moderate Eastland's position. My reference to Senator Russell's statement did not faze him in the slightest. He replied that he had strenuous objec tions to Fortas and was irritated over a speech the Associate Justice had made in New York earlier in the year. In that speech Fortas had said that the battles of the black man for equality in America were essentially the same as those of the Jew and that Jews must help in the civil‐rights struggle. Senator Eastland interpreted that statement as a conspiratorial call for Jews and Ne groes to take over America. He said that he was aware of Senator Russell's position but that he did not think that in the end, when all the debate was over, Senator Russell would support Fortas. His prediction proved accurate. I strongly believed that Eastland had received assurances that if he blocked the Fortas nomination and the Repub licans captured the White House in No vember, a Chief Justice more to his lik ing would be appointed. I realized after that August meeting that we probably could not muster the votes to put the Fortas nomination through. Two months later, after the Senate refused, by a vote of 45 to 43, to consider his nomination, Justice For tas bowed to the inevitable and asked that his name be withdrawn. I com plied with his request with a heavy heart. INEVER shared the intense dislike of Richard Nixon felt by many of my fellow Democrats. I had served with him in the House of Representa tives and in the Senate, and I was Senate majority leader during most of his term as President of the Senate. I considered him a much‐maligned and misunderstood man. I looked upon Nix on as a tough, unyielding partisan and a shrewd politician, but always a man trying to do the best for his country as he saw it. I did, however, disagree strongly with his political philosophy. I believed that if he were elected, he would certainly try to undo many of the hard‐won achievements of the New Frontier and the Great Society. It is always difficult to interpret the outcome of an election, but I have sev eral observations to make about the election in 1968. First, I believe that Saigon's misinterpretation of our Viet nam policy, a misinterpretation exploit ed by some people who claimed to speak for the Nixon camp, damaged Vice President Humphrey's election chances. Politically, I was not overly partisan in the campaign because I had promised the nation in my speech on March 31 that I would keep the Presi dency out of politics and because that obviously was what the Humphrey or ganization preferred. Part of Saigon's foot‐dragging about attending the Paris talks, I believed, stemmed from the Vice President's for eign‐policy speech in Salt Lake City on Sept. 30, a speech that was widely in terpreted as a refutation of the Admin istration's Vietnam policy, particularly with respect to bombing. That interpre tation was not discouraged by several Humphrey aides who briefed the press after the speech. The facts are that the Vice President called me from Salt Lake City before he made the speech to tell me about it and to say that it was not intended to be a major departure from our current policies. I believe he meant it. But what I believed was less import ant than what the leaders of the Gov ernment in Saigon construed from the Vice President's statements. They inter preted the speech, and the tone of Vice President Humphrey's subsequent for eign policy statements, as a major de parture from our stated policies. We soon learned that the leaders in Saigon suspected the Administration of sending, up a trial balloon. This suspicion made them extremely nervous and dis trustful of the Johnson‐Humphrey Ad ministration and of the entire Demo cratic party. Against this background, people who claimed to speak for the Nixon camp. began encouraging Saigon to stay away from Paris and promising that Nixon, if elected, would inaugurate a policy, more to Saigon's liking. Those efforts paid off. On Nov. 1, after previously indicating that they would go to the Paris peace talks, the South Vietnamese leaders decided not to participate. That, I am convinced, cost Hubert Humphrey the Presidency, especially since a shift of only a few hundred thousand votes would have made him the winner. But that circumstance explains only one aspect of the 1968 election. Another essential aspect of the election was the fact that the Democratic party had pressed too far out in front of the Amer ican people. The blue‐collar worker felt that the Democratic party had traded his welfare for the welfare of the black man. The middle‐class suburbanite felt that we were gouging him in order to pay for the antipoverty programs. The black man, having tasted the fruits of equality. began demanding his rightful share of the American promise faster than most of the nation was willing to let him have it. The disruptive methods of the radicals of the “new left,” at the Chicago con vention and on university campuses, offended the majority of American citi zens and pushed them to the right. The violence in Chicago was one of the greatest political assets Nixon had. The extremists made it impossible for us to carry states like Oklahoma, Kentucky and Tennessee, which should have been solid Humphrey states. In spite of this, I am convinced that if I had run again I would have been re‐elected. The last polls taken in Feb ruary and March, before I announced I would not run, indicated I could have defeated Richard Nixon, with or without George Wallace in the running. That does not alter the point, but it reflects the fact that the American people do not casually turn an incumbent Presi dent out of office. (Whether they would, have united behind me once they had returned me to office is another ques tion—one that I had serious reservations about.) Six days after his victory, President elect Nixon and Mrs. Nixon came to the White House for lunch and nearly four hours of conferences and briefings. Mrs. Johnson and I took the Nixons on a tour of the second‐floor living quarters of the Executive Mansion. I was surprised to learn that it was the first time either of them had seen that part of the White House, in spite of the eight years they had spent in the Eisenhower Adminis tration. Following the briefings, we went out to meet the White House press corps, and the President‐elect made an extremely gracious and unexpected, ges ture. He announced: “…If progress is to be made on matters like Vietnam, the current possible crisis in the Mideast, the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union with regard to certain outstanding mat ters—if progress is to be made in any of these fields, it can be made only if the parties on the other side realize that the current Administration is set ting forth policies that will be carried forward by the next Administration.… I gave assurance in each instance to the Secretary of State and, of course, to the President, that they could speak not just for this Administration but for the nation, and that meant for the next Administration as well.” Later in the week Mr. Nixon appar ently had second thoughts about giving me such sweeping support, and he an nounced that he had made this pledge with the understanding that these would be “prior consultation and prior agree ment” between the two of us before I took any major step in foreign policy. I was surprised by that statement. There had been no promise ever requested or given that there would be “prior con sultation and prior agreement.” I certainly did not want to destroy all the goodwill we had built up over the past several months by launching into a public debate with Mr. Nixon. But I could not allow the impression to stand that Mr. Nixon had become a kind of co‐President. I announced to the press that “the decisions that will be Made between now and Jan. 20 will be made by this President and by this Secretary, of State and by this Secretary of De fense.” That cleared up the misunder standing and the President‐elect and I remained on cordial terms. ON the last night of my term of office, Jan. 19, Lady Bird and I held a small, informal party in the second‐floor living quarters of the White House rot the members of my staff. In many ways it was a moving and emo tional occasion, for we had developed a closeness in our time together. When it was over and the last guest gone, I walked over to the West Wing to do some final work at my desk. I wandered lonely through the empty offices, silent now after so many months of activity, to make sure that everything was in order for the Nixon take‐over the next day. When I walked into one office I noticed a sheet of paper on the desk. Thinking that it was a piece of scrap paper, I started to throw it in the wastebasket until I read what was writ ten on it. The message was for the next man who would sit at that desk. It was signeld by the aide who had vacated the office, and it read: “Good luck.” ??

1424-> Taipei Won't Comment On Its Ankara Policy
TAIPEI, Taiwan, Aug. 6— Government officials would not comment today on the significance of Taiwan's “suspension” rather than sev erance of diplomatic rela tions with Turkey, which yes terday announced her recog nition of Communist China. Since last October Taipei has cut relations with Can ada, Italy, Chile, Kuwait and Cameroon after those coun tries established diplomatic ties with Peking. A statement issued last night by the Foreign Ministry differed from those on the other occasions in using the term “suspension” to de scribe the break in relations.

1425-> What's an Old Shack Doing in the Shadow of East Hampton?
SAGAPONACK, L. I.—Even old shacks can fit into a sophisticated building scheme in this resort village about five miles west of East Hampton. For instance, Robert Dash, the paint er, considered himself lucky to have acquired two such dilapidated dwell ings. They were standing on piles among the daffodils when he found and purchased his two‐acre tract five years ago. Mr. Dash saw in the migrant work ers' shacks a bonanza of weathered wood and they inspired the U‐shape of the house that resulted more than a year later. Actually the house is an assemblage of the two 19th‐century shacks, part of an old barn and a long enclosed hall that he had built to join the vintage structures. “It's nothing more than a railroad flat in which you have to go through every room to get from one end to the other,” said the artist, surveying his rambling, shingled house from the center of his densely planted garden. Standing there knee‐deep in foliage, he explained that his life‐long love of gar dening had led him to build the house to frame the garden on three sides so that he could see it from every room in the house. The fourth side of the garden is banded by a rose arbor. “The roses are resting now,” he said. But from the look of the flower and vegetable garden, little else was. “I grow anything that requires no staking and is happy in a crowd,” he continued, noting that the strong pre vailing winds here make impractical growing anything necessitating such support. There were mauve and white snapdragons, orange day lilies, yellow meadowroot, blue thistle, purple iris and ivory‐colored sunflowers vying for attention among sage, celery, parsley, garlic, fennel and wild strawberries. “The garden is planned to look ac cidental and like a natural oc currence,” he said, heading toward the front door at the rear of the barn. The house has something of the same casual quality, outside and in. The roof line meanders, beginning low with the pitched roofs of the shacks, continuing at a right angle through the flat and balustraded widow's walk that sur mounts the 50‐foot‐long enclosed hall, and peaking in the steeply angled barn gable. The barn with its earth floor, slaugh tering stalls and generous hay loft orig inally attracted Mr. Dash to the prop erty. But he could not use it as the sole residence because, under the building code, it was too close to the road, and too costly to move. But the shacks were lightweight, and, Mr. Dash was told, if he waited for rain, a few workmen could slide them across the mud without difficulty. “When we moved the first shack it collapsed, folding like a giant pair of ear muffs,” he recalled. Reassembled and, with the second shack, fixed to a firm foundation and improved with new floors, shingles and roofs, the shacks have been trans formed into two bedrooms, the bath and kitchen. Open to the kitchen is the dining area at the end of what Mr. Dash calls his “great hall.” It is this room that sets the sun‐washed and sparely furnished mood that pervades the house. “And that is the function of a front hall in any home,” he said. “Only mine is not at the front, it's in the middle.” The hall has its function, too. “I do small painting here, and it's good for pacing,” he continued. Pacing gives him exercise in winter when the lure of the garden subsides and the winds come. Sparsely furnished with wicker chairs, a country dining table and rush‐bottom, ladderback chairs of uncertain age, and a few 19th‐century family heirlooms, the hall has a host of greenery and a few of Mr. Dash's floral and still‐life paint ings. Past the well ‐ filled bookshelves at the end of the hall is the long narrow living room that soars more than two stories to the barn's rafters. This room is cozier—a place to read, entertain guests and escape the sound of the driving winter winds off the Atlantic. Here there is additional evidence of what Mr. Dash calls his “addiction to wicker.” Coexisting with the rattan are local antiques finds, the most impres sive of which are the 19th‐century settle and bulbous iron stove. The entire renovation, including the use of ceramic tile flooring edged with old brick that he found in the local dump, and used for both the living room and hall, was kept to $14,000. (Mr. Dash is reluctant to divulge the purchase price for the barn and out buildings.) The remodeling costs were kept this low by employing such cost saving devices as no subflooring under the tiled areas and stock materials wherever possible. The windows, for instance, are not only stock sixes but in the hall they are even thriftier—fixed, closed perma nently. “I don't need open windows here,” he explained. “The doors provide sufficient circulation. And the closed windows are a heat trap in the winter.” In spite of his love of gardening, is fall and winter, when gardening is over, that the bachelor loves the most. “The sky loses its milky cast and gets this reflected ocean blue light,” he said. “For a time there is a definite lonely period. But this passes, and then there's solitude. You get up with the sun and work through the day and read at night. The nights are very long. Walking here in fall and winter is mar velous. One can shake out one's head very quickly.” The beach Is where Mr. Dash walks with his Airedale, Dunny Doo, but never swims, because he dislikes crowds in summer and also finds the Atlantic treacherous and abrupt,” he said. But he has plans for the acreage outside his compound where, until now, he has only planted a variety of wild grasses. There he intends to make a natural pool and to stock it with fish. “It will be of course for swimming and inviting for the birds.”

1426-> ‘It's a Funny Old World’
LOOKING backward was a mistake for Mrs. Lot. But, for writers, it has been a helpful habit over the centuries. Latest among the over‐the‐shoulder lookers are Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse, who once proclaimed, “Stop the World—I Want to Get Off.” Now they are going right back to the dawn of time for a new musical, “It's a Funny Old World We Live In, But the World's Not Entirely to Blame.” To make their point, the team focusing on the chronicle of a small family unit and its struggle to cope with life through the ages. The family unit, whose head will be acted by Newley, will not, however, get older, It simply will he transplanted from age to age and even from one nationality to another. News of the Rialto Among the subjects to he examined, according to Bricusse, will be, “the endless futility of endless wars,” the authors making the oft‐disregarded point that, from the beginning, the world has virtually never been without war. Ecology will be poked into, of course. And those ancient antagonists, God and the Devil, will be around, carrying on a dialogue over what went wrong with the Grand Design that we should now be where we are. In addition to Newley, actors will be needed for the principal roles of God, the Devil, the wife and a friend of the family. Several comedians also will be needed, Bricusse reported, to help provide the vaudeville touch the musical will have. Which brings up that title and its origin: “It's a Funny Old World We Live in, But the World's Not Entirely to Blame.” comes from the first two lines of an old English music hall song. Hillard Elkins, who this season has had the satisfaction of presenting his wife Claire Bloom in her successful Ibsen repertory—“A Doll's House” and “Hedda Gabler” —in addition to co‐producing “The Rothschilds,” will be the producer of the Newley‐Bricusse work. Rehearsals are planned for late August with a mid‐November opening on Broadway sells its cigarettes, beer, automobile tires and scented feminine hygiene sprays. There may he some irony intended, but it does seem to me—a white—that a film about black militancy deserves a sterner discipline if it wants to avoid charges of exploitation. Practically all of the real drama to be found in “Sweet Sweetback” is contained in that one little scene of the shoeshine man, and it's not actually a scene, only a part of another montage. The most interesting thing about “Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song” is Melvin Van Peebles himself, although not in his capacity as either the star, the director, the writer, the composer or the editor. Rather, it's in his capacity as a phenomenon. Van Peebles is one of the few black talents to succeed in reaching a position that would allow him to direct his own movies, no mean feat in an industry that thought it had come of age with “Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?” Like Ossie Davis, (“Cotton Comes to Harlem”), who began as an actor and a writer, and Gordon Parks, (“The Learning Tree”), who was an internationally known still photographer, the Chicago‐bred Van Peebles began by doing other things. Having earned something of a reputation as a novelist and painter in France, he was able to get together enough money to shoot his first feature over there, “The Story of a Three‐Day Pass,” which attracted enough attention to persuade Columbia Pictures to give him a three picture contract, and to direct the ill‐fated, satirical comedy, “Watermelon Man,” whose screenplay was written by Herman Raucher, the author Now only in his late 30's, Van Peebles has a record that might lie envied by most white directhrs in that he has made at least three features he wanted to make, with very little outside interference. It's the kind of success story, in fact, that gives a hollow ring to the dedication of “Sweet Sweetback.” (After all, Van Peebles is a celebrity in The Man's society). I am sure that Van Peebles was right when, last year, he was quoted as saying that the only sane way for a black man to act is militantly, but the militancy of “Sweet Sweetback” is of a dull order, seemingly designed only to reinforce the prejudices of black audiences without in any way disturbing those prejudices. Black audiences, I suppose, will find therapeutic value in this sort of thing —in a black black fairy tale in which all the blacks good and all the whites are evil. It may serve the process by which a black identity can be created, and if this were the sole criterion by which “Sweet Sweetback” were to be judged, it might well be called successful. But even then, I'm not sure. When I saw the film the other afternoon at the Cinerama Theater on Broadway, the reaction of the mostly black audience was occasionally uproarious, as, for example, in the scene in which Sweet Sweetback crushes the head of a white policeman with a loose handcuff. Although, in the context of the film, the policeman deserved everything he got, I'm not convinced that shouts of “Kick his ass!” and “Kill him!” were indicative that an especially black identity was being created. When the audience at the New Amsterdam Theater on 42d Street urges Dr. Frankenstein on to new and terrible dismemberments, does that mean the New Amsterdam audience is identifying with the downon‐their‐luck members of the medical profession? I suspect it simply means that the sort of audiences—black and white—who go to those movies want a little action, and they don't much care how it. If Van Peebles's intent was to make a contemporary folk parable about a black saint, he has, I think, failed, not because his film vision is too grand, but because it's too simple. The movie looks exceedingly busy, but it isn't. Van Peebles doesn't seem to trust his scenario and, as result, he tries to add dimension to it by photographing everything as either a zoom in, as a zoom out, as a pan across, or as a cut to something else. Behind this busy technique is a slight, pale, escape drama, about a black man whose Priapic powers are of the sort that prompted daydreams (and nightmares) in master bedrooms of the Old South. By means of the buoyant comedy and wild narrative of “Cotton Comes to Harlem,” Ossie Davis succeeded to a certain extent in turning such cliches and stereotypes inside out, as if, by embracing them, he ridiculed the white paranoia that created them, and, at the same time, found the underlying truth. Nothing except camera technique is turned inside out in “Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song.” It may be—as some of its supporters claim—the Black Experience in America, distilled to its essence. My feeling, distilled to its essence, is that that experience deserves a better film. For another view of “Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,” see Page 11.

1428-> Senate for End to Ban on Rhodesian Ore
WASHINGTON, Sept. 23— The Senate put aside defense matters temporarily today to decide, in defiance of a United Nations embargo, that the United States should permit the importing of chrome ore from Rhodesia. The Senate voted, 46 to 36, to keep a provision in the military procurement bill that would have the effect of per mitting such imports. If accepted by the House as seems likely, this provision would represent the most seri ous dent thus far in the eco nomic sanctions against Rho desia that were imposed by the Security Council in 1968 three years after the former self governing British colony de clared its independence and es tablished a white minority Gov vernment. Under authority granted the President under the United Na tions Participation Act of 1945, the Johnson Administration Complied with the Security Council resolution by ordering an embargo on all trade with Rhodesia. The fight to lift the embargo to permit the importation of Rhodesian chrome was led by Senatory Harry F. Byrd Jr., In dependent of Virginia, with lobbying support, according to Congressional sources, from American metal companies with mining interests in Rho desia. The Byrd proposal adopted today specifies that under the United Nations Participation Act the President could not prohibit the importation of a strategic material from any, country if the same product was being imported from a Communist‐dominated country. Since the United States is importing chrome from the So viet Union, the effect of the proposal would be to remove the President's authority to ban the import of chrome from Rhodesia. Originally the Senator tried to lift the ban on Rhodesian chrome through separate legis lation, but this was blocked by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which decided last month to postpone any action on the Byrd bill. Senator Byrd, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, then arranged for the committee to make his pro posal an amendment to the pro curement bill, which authorizes weapons production and re search by the Pentagon. The State Department was opposed to the Byrd amend ment, but the Administration did not wage a strenuous enough campaign to bring over many of the conservative Re publicans who normally vote in accordance with White House wishes. Meanwhile, according to Con gressional sources, American companies with chrome in terests in Rhodesia had been lobbying in Congress, par ticularly among the Southern ers, for relief from the em bargo. Among the most active com panies, according to these sources, were the Union Car bide Corporation and the Foote Mineral Company of Exton, Pa. Both have chrome‐producing at filiates or subsidiaries in Rho desia. Shortly before the vote, a Union Carbide lobbyist glee Fully told a member of the Sen ate Foreign Relations Commit tee staff, “We've got the votes.” This appraisal was not shared Iby the State Department, which thought it had the votes to delete the Byrd amendment from the bill. Carrying the Administra tion's case on the Senate floor, Senator Gale W. McGee, Dem ocrat of Wyoming, protested that the Byrd amendment, if adopted, would represent “for mal United States defiance” of a Security Council resolution and would impair American re lations “with virtually all the countries of the African con tinent.” Senator Byrd argued that it was “illogical and dangerous” for the United States to be come dependent upon the So viet Union for a strategic ma terial, particularly at a time when it, is spending billions of dollars, to defend Itself against the Russians. About 60 per cent of the chrome, which is used in steel alloys such as stainless steel, is now imported from the So viet Union, in contrast to 30 per cent before the embargo. At the same time, the price of Soviet chrome ore has risen from $25 a ton in 1965 to $72 a ton. On the basis of Administra tion figures, Senator McGee contested Senator Byrd's con tention that the United States was in danger of becoming de pendent upon the Soviet Union for chrome. The Government has a stock pile of 5,344,000 tons of chrome ore, of which the Office of Emergency Planning recently declared 2,225,000 tons was in excess of foreseeable strategic needs. The Administration recently submitted legislation, now be fore the Senate Armed Services Committee to sell 1.3 million tons from the stockpile as sur plus. Of the 900,000 tons of high‐ grade chrome ore consumed an nually in the United States, only about 10 per cent, accord ing to the Administration, is used for defense purposes. Returning to the military pro curement bill, the Senate, by a 58‐26 vote, rejected an amendment by Senator George McGovern, Democrat of South Dakota, that would have called upon the President to submit an alternate defense budget with a $60‐billion ceiling along with the fiscal 1973 budget that is expected to call for ap proximately $80‐billion for the Pentagon.

1429-> REGENTS PROPOSE A COLLEGE ‘REGION’
The State Board of Regents will establish a council of major college and university leaders today to devise a master plan for the joint development of public and private higher edu cation in New York City. State officials, concerned about a lack of effective coop eration between educational institutions at a time of rapidly rising costs, will ask the coun cil to recommend measures by next spring that could lead to a substantial change in the way colleges and universities in the city are operated and financed. Among the issues to be con sidered by the council, which will make a comprehensive in ventory of the city's needs and resources in higher education, are the following: ¶Treatment of the city as a “region” in higher education, with mutual arrangements for planning and carrying out pro grams in the area. ¶Use of private institutions by students at public colleges and universities, partly as a means of improving the finan cial condition of private insti tutions. ¶Cross‐registration among in stitutions, giving students at small colleges broader curricu lar choices. Consolidation of relatively expensive graduate and profes sional programs in fields of limited demand. ¶Designation of certain university libraries as “research collections” available to stu dents from all colleges in the city. ¶Study of the role of private institutions in helping to im plement the City University's year‐old open admissions pro‐ gram. The program guarantees a place in the City University to any high school graduate in the city. The 17‐member council, whose recommendations will have to be approved by the Regents and possibly the Legislature. will include the presidents of eight private institutions in the city—Columbia, Fordham, the New School for Social Research, College of Mount Saint Vin cent, Pace, Manhattan, Pratt In stitute and New York Univer sity. Other members are the Chan cellor of the State University; the Chancellor and Deputy Chancellor of the City Univer sity and the presidents of four colleges of the university and two representatives of “the public at large” — Harold Howe 2d, vice president of the Ford Foundation, and Arland F. Christ‐Janer, president of the College Entrance Examina tion Board. Edward J. Mortola, president of Pace College, will serve as chairman of the Council. “This effort is absolutely vital if were to marshal all our resources for the benefit of the entire city,” Dr. Mortola said in an interview yesterday. He said it had taken “a near crisis” to bring the public and private institutions closer— “we've had to be frightened into it.” The private institutions, he observed, “have a great deal of rugged independence and, among the public institutions, there was a tendency to go it alone.” Every four years the Regents, the state's top educational policymaking body, promulgate a statewide master plan for higher education. Part of that master plan — due for revision in 1972 — is the plan for the City University; another part is the plan for the State University. Plans for the private institutions, also in cluded by the Regents, are less cohesive. The authority of the Regents to enforce any aspect of the statewide master plan varies greatly. But a more basic prob lem according to senior state education officials, is that the components of the plan are de veloped without much coordina tion. “The plans for the City Uni versify, the State University, and the private colleges and universities have been pre pared almost in isolation from one another,” said T. Edward Hollander, deputy commissioner for higher and professional education. In an attempt to reverse this tradition, and encourage economies and cooperative un dertakings, the State Education Department is promoting a “regional” approach to higher education. A department official ex plained that “inter‐institutional cooperation is widespread in the state but the overwhelming number of such relationships tend to be trivial.” “In most cases,” he added, “they involve informal and voluntary associa tions concerning activities of secondary importance.” The effort to produce a master plan for higher educa tion in New York City that is “mutually acceptable to the public and private colleges and universities may well be fol lowed by similar regional ven tures elsewhere in the state,” the official added. However, he said the state would not order such efforts unless the institutions involved wanted them and “indicated a readiness to accept the conse quences” of regional planning. College and university lead ers in New York City have in creasingly urged joint institu tional efforts. Virtually all of the administrators are worried about diminishing funds and mounting deficits. The private institutions are fearful of losing students to the City University, which does not charge tuition to full‐time un dergraduates, and the City Uni versity is concerned about meeting the educational needs of the thousands of additional students who have enrolled as a result of open admissions.

1430-> Major Provisions of Tax Bill, With Details on the Differences in Two Versions
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23 —Foitowtng is a summary of the major provisions of the tax bin with details on the differences between the House and Senate versions. These differences will be resolved in a Senate‐House conference coinmittee. INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES General Tax Relief The personal exemption, now $650, would be increased to $675 this year and $800 next year by the Senate bill. The House bill would increase the exemption to $750 next year. The standard deduction, which is currently 13 per cent of income or $1,500, whichever is smaller, would be increased to 15 per cent or $2,000 in both bills, effective in 1972. Low‐Income Tax Relief The low‐income allowance would be increased to $1,300 in both versions of the tax bill. While the allowance is aimed primarily at eliminating atli Federal income tax payments by persons with incomes below what are considered to be the poverty levels, it would also reduce the taxes of many individuals and families with incomes of up to $8,666. The beneficiaries would include anyone whose standard deduction or itemized deductions were less than $1,300. The allowance would go up to the $1,300 level effective this year under the Senate version of the bill and next year under the House version. It is currently $1,050, with a provision partly limiting its use by persons with Incomes above the 1969 poverty levels. This limitation would be repealed, effective this year, under the House version. The income levels at which families of different sizes would become tax exempt under the $1,300 low‐income allowance closely approximate what are expected to be the 1972 official poverty levels. The tax‐exempt levels are: single person, $2,050; two‐person family, $2.800; three, $3,550; four, $4,300; five, $5,050; six, $5,800. Costs, of Higher Education A tax credit is provided in the Senate bill, with no counterpart provision in the House version, for a portion of the costs of education beyond high school, including technical schools as well as colleges and junior colleges. The credit would apply to tuition, fees and books and other supplies, but not to outlays for housing, food or other living costs. It would be a maximum of $325 per year per student. The credit — a subtraction from taxes that would otherwise be owed — would be 75 per cent of the first $200 of higher‐education expenses; 25 per cent of the next $300 and 10 per cent of the next $1,000. The maximum amount would thus be obtainable by those who paid out $1,500 or more in one year. The full amount of the credit could be taken by families whose incomes did not exceed $25,000. Above that, reduced benefits would be available to families paying for the education of one child until their income exceeded $57,500; to families educating two children where the income did not exceed $??,000, and for three children where the income did not exceed $122,500. Families who owed no Federal income tax, or whose tax was less than the credit to which they were entitled, would receive a cash payment from the Government. Day Care and Household Help Working couples or households in which there is only one employable adult would be permitted a deduction of up to $400 a month for the in‐home expenses for invalids or for children of 14 or under and for other household help. A deduction for away‐from‐home care for children (but not invalids) of up to $200 a month for one child, $300 for two and $400 for three or more would be permitted as part of the overall $400 total, Working couples would be permitted the deduction in full if their combined income did not exceed $18,000; the permis sible deduction would be reduced 50 cents for, every dollar of income above the $18,000 ceiling. Thus couples with incomes of up to $27,000 would receive at leak part of the benefits of the deduction. The provision’ contains no income limitation for single adults who have such child‐care or invalid‐care responsibilities. Even persons who do not itemize personal deductions would be able to take advantage of this provision because the permitted deductions are considered business expenses, and thus deductible even by those who use the standard deduction. Property Tax Paid by Elderly Persons aged 65 or older (including a couple only one of whom was over 65) would receive a credit of up to $300 year, offsetting the property taxes they paid. Elderly renters could take the credit, subject to the same ceiling, to offset up to 25 per cent of the rent they paid. Elderly persons with inconies of up to $6,500 would be eligible for the entire, credit; up to $6,800, they could take part of it. This provision is in the Sen. ate bill only. Disabled Persons Persons who were disabled and unable to work would be given a double personal exemption, as blind persons and persons over 85 ‘are now. The provision is, found only in the Senate version of the bill and the types and extent of disability covered are not clearly defined. Withholding Taxes The withholding tax system and the withholding tables for 1972 and later years will be changed to make the amount of tax withheld come closer to the total taxes that will actually be owed. For low‐income families with two or more workers, the withholding forms supplied to employers will be changed so that only one worker in the family can be credited with the special loW‐income allowance in calculating withholding. When both workers in a low‐income family are credited with the low‐income allowance, as has happened widely this year, serious underwithholding results. For higher‐income taxpayers, the withholding rates will be increased so that the withheld taxes will approximately cover the amount of tax due for single persons with incomes of up to $25,000 and for married couples (with only one spouse working) with incomes of up to $31,000. Married couples with both spouses working will still have to make special arrangements to increase their withholding taxes to avoid under with holding. At present, individuals or oneincome couples with incomes of more than $13,500 are generally underwithheld unless they make special withholding arrangements. The Senate version of the bill would make all the changes in withholding effective next year. The House version would put them into effect in two stages, next year and in 1975. Despite the tax‐reduction provisions elsewhere in the bill, the changes in withholding would result in higher withholding for many families beginning Jan. 1, 1972. But their April 15 final tax payments would be correspondingly lower. Unearned Income of Dependents This is one of the few taxincreasing provisions of the bill. A tax advantage that wealthy persons have been able to achieve by giving incomeearning property to their children would be reduced. Under the Senate bill, any person claimed as a dependent on the tax return of another person 1(as children under 19 or stu Idents may be, regardless of of much income they have) would not be permitted to use the personal exemption or take any personal deduction against unearned income (such as dividents or rents). In the House bill, the denial of the use of the personal exemption and deductions would be limited to cases in which the parent had set up a trust in which he had retained an interest EXCISE TAXES Auto and Truck Taxes The 7 per cent excise tax on automobiles and the 10 per cent tax on trucks weighing 10,000 pounds or less would be repealed under both the House and Senate bills. In addition, the Senate bill would repeal the 10 per cent tax on light trailers and on buses used by privately owned urban transportation systems. The effective date of repeal for all the affected vehicles is Aug. 15 in the Senate bill; the date for trucks is Sept. 22 in the House bill. The Senate bill also provides that the excise tax on foreign cars may be reimposed, at the President's discretion, on cars manufactured in countries that discriminate against the importation of American cars. Alcohol Taxes There would be no change in the amount of Federal tax levied on alcoholic beverages, but an amount equal to 7 per cent of the taxes collected on alcoholic beverages would, under the Senate bill, be taken from general Government revenues each year and put in the Highway Trust Fund. The amount thus diverted to highway funding would be $350million,. at present, which is an amount equal to the loss the trust fund would sustain from repeal of the excise tax on light trucks. The proceeds of the alcohol tax would be the first revenues not directly related to highway usage to be diverted to the Highway Trust Fund. INVESTMENT CREDIT The 7 per cent tax credit given to businesses against the cost of equipment would be restored, applicable to equipment ordered after April 1 or delivered on or after Aug. 15. In the Senate version, a 10 per cent credit would be provided for equipment purchased for use in rural areas or in the central portions of cities with unemployment rates of 6 per cent or more. All United States‐made new machinery and equipment would be eligible for the credit. Limits would be imposed on the amount of the credit that could be taken on used machinery, which are so strict in the House bill to limit the use essentially to small businesses. In general, only equipment produced in the United States would be eligible for the credit so long as the United States kept the emergency 10 per cent tariff surcharge in effect. But both the House and Senate versions give the President discretionary authority to grant exemptions from the ban against using the credit on foreign‐made equipment, and the Senate bill also gives him discretionary authority over the timing of the termination of the ban. A number of other details of the credit are different in the two versions, some of which will be of considerable financial importance to specific kinds of Businesses. LIBERALIZED DEPRECIATION The news system of calculating depreciation deductions that was put into effect administratively by the Treasury earlier this year would be embodied in law in both House and Senate bills. The system provides, basically, that businesses may write off the cost of equipment 20 per cent faster or slower than before. Both bills eliminate the Treasury's proposed liberalized treatment of depreciation of equipment in the year in which it was purchased, however. EXPORT PROMOTION In both the House and Senate bills, a new section would be added to the tax law providing for the creation of a special new type of subsidiary corporation to conduct export sales, a portion of the profits of which would be tax free. These special subsidiaries would be known as domestic‐international sales corporations or DISC's. The Senate bill would permit essentially indefinite deferral of taxes on half the profits of such a corporation, provided the profits were plowed back into the business in certain specified ways. The House version would allow the deferral on that portion of the DISC's profits that exceeded 75 per cent of its average profits in the 1968 through 1970. EMPLOYMENT OF FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS Employers using workers from the Labor Department's work incentive program (WIN) would receive a tax credit that would reimburse them for part of their payroll costs of hiring such persons. The credit would be 20 per cent of the amount of wages paid to these former welfare recipients in the first 12 months of their employment, provided they continued to work for the same employer for another 12 months. The employer could take the tax credit at the end of the first year but would have to pay it back to the Government if the worker's employment was terminated, unless for cause or disability, before the end of the second year. This section is contained only in the Senate bill. INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS These bonds, which are sold by municipal governments to finance the construction of plants that are then leased to private businesses, can be tax exempt, at present, only when the bond issue does not exceed $1‐million, or $5‐million in certain circumstances. A provision of the Senate bill makes the ceiling $5‐million without restrictions. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS Extended Unemployment Benefits Unemployment compensation benefits, which are currently paid for a maximum of 39 weeks, would be extended to a maximum of 65 weeks, under the Senate's bill, in states where the unemployment rate has averaged 6 per cent or more for 13 consecutive weeks. The additional benefits would be fully paid from Federal Government funds until the end of June, 1973, and would be 80 per cent federally financed thereafter. To pay for the extended benefits, the Federal portion of the unemployment compensation tax, which is paid by employers, would be increased from 0.5 to 0,59 per cent, raising the over‐all maximum tax from 3.2 to 3,29 per cent of covered payrolls. Reporting of Tax Preferences Under the Senate bill, the Administration would be required to make public an annual itemized accounting of the amount of tax revenue the Government was losing because’ of special provisions in the tax law. Among the covered items would be such tax preferences as depletion allowances, rapid depreciation, deductibility’ of charitable contributions and so on. Confidentiality of Tax Returns The Senate bill would prohibit anyone who prepares a tax return for someone qlSe to disclose any of the information on the return to a third party, without the written consent of the taxpayer. Penalties of up to $1,000 or imprisonment of up to one year are provided for violation. The amendment was primarily aimed at commercial tax‐preparation organizations, such as H &R Block, Inc., which has been accused by Federal Trade Commission of selling tax information to other commercial interests. Balance of Payments Provisions The Senate bill gives the President extensive discretionary authority to protect the international economic position of the United States by imposing quotas on imports or by increasing the 10 per cent emergency tariff surcharge to as much as 15 per cent. Either action may apply either ‘generally or selectively, but both the surcharge and the quota may not be imposed’ on the same article. Use of this authority would be limited to two years following a finding that a balance of payments emergency existed and no such emergency could be proclaimed starting later than Dec. 31, 1974.

1431-> Jail Deaths in France Lead Pompidou to Question Reform Moves
PARIS, Sept. 23 — President Pompidou, responding to a wave of revulsion at the slay ing of two hostages by con victs yesterday, took issue to day with proposals for penal reform and the abolition of the guillotine. In reply to a question at his news conference about the tragedy at Clairvaux Prison, where two convicts killed a nurse and a guard before be ing overcome by the police, the President said that he expected that the Government would be blamed. “It's already being said,” he continued, “that one should have psychiatrists, sociologists, etc., around these hardened criminals, to give them some other prospect than life im prisonment.” “I don't believe much in psychiatrists in this field,” he said., “Even when one kills in a moment of wild rage, one is not permanently mad, and what doctor will keep someone who is evidently not mad in a psychiatric asylum?”. The President went on to re count the story of a man who killed his wife, served his time as a model prisoner, married the prison social worker after his release, and killed her two years later. He told the assembled jour nalists, “Happy are those who solve the problem in 50 lines.” The President's comment was foreshadowed in the newspaper Combat, which observed this morning, “Mr. Pompidou will not have an easy task if he must decide, in the face of pub lic opinion, whether or not to grant grace to these two muti neers.” Nobody has gone to the guillotine since Mr. Pompidou came to office in early 1969. A poll at that time showed a substantial majority of the pub lic in favor of abolition, and advocates had some hopes for passage of such a measure at the forthcoming session of Par liament. But the press today, although divided on the merits of the issue, agreed that the Clairvaux tragedy had dimmed prospects for reform. A Parisian Deputy of the majority party, Claude Krieg, asked in a public statement whether withholding the death penalty in this case “would not be considered a sign of weak ness?” Mr. Krieg and many others also asked, however, whether the authorities had done every thing possible to avoid the tragedy. A lawyer for one of the convict killers said he had volunteered to serve as an in termediary but his offer had been ignored. Unions representing the judi ciary and prison staffs declared in a joint statement that a “climate of insecurity” reigned because of a shortage of per sonnel and other means to carry out reforms already de creed. Outside a hospital in Troyes, near Clairvaux, guards from the prison mobbed and tried to overturn the ambulance in which the two convicts were being taken to Paris after treat ment for head injuries. Two young guards resigned, on the ground that they “didn't want to die for 1,100 francs [$200] a month.” They com plained among other things that, recent reforms, permitting the prisoners to receive newspapers and to listen to the radio, had spread the news of the Attica, N. Y., mutiny among them. On the other hand, Prof. Mi chel Foucault of the College de France, a leading advocate of penal reform, said tonight that tension had been running high at Clairvaux since an escape attempt early this year. He as serted that six men implicated in the break had been “badly beaten in the court before the eyes of the other prisoners.” “There is a movement of re volt,” he said. “I think Pompi dou's toughness is linked to this situation. The Government is likely to suspend the reform movement, but that will not solve anything. They will amuse the gallery with the ;death pen alty.' “The Clairvaux tragedy poses the question of the penal sys tem and not that of capital punishment,” he added.

1432-> SENATE BILL AIDS RURAL INDUSTRY
WASHINGTON, July 7 — Congress was presented today with a plan designed to reverse the trend of immigration of the rural poor to big‐city slums and to attract industry to rural areas. Democratic Senators Herman E. Talmadge of Gedrgia, chair man of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota intro duced the complex measure. It would create a new rural bank ing system to be funded Initial ly by $2‐billion in Federal ap propriations over a 10‐year period at a rate of $200‐mil lion a year. The proposed system would be modeled after the existing Farm Credit Administration, which provides loans to agricul tural enterprises. The new sys tem, however, would extend aid to enable private industry and business to locate in rural areas. It would also enable private banks to participate instead of competing with the rural bank ing system as they do at pres ent with the Farm Credit Ad ministration. Major provisions of the 72‐ page bill provide the follow ing: ¶Creation of a new post of assistant secretary in the De partment of Agriculture in charge of rural development credit. Under him would be two separate agencies, a Farm De velopment Administration to handle farm credit and a Rural Enterprise and Community De velopment Administration to handle all nonfarm rural credit. This setup would replace the existing Farmers Home Ad ministration. ¶Establishmenx of a 19‐mem ber Rural Development Credit Board. This board would super vise a Rural Development In vestment Administration and Rural Development Credit Agency. ¶Ten regional rural develop ment credit banks would be set up under the Rural Develop ment Credit Agency, which would oversee the operations of 300 to 500 multicounty fi nancial agencies that would finance the local projects. ¶The Secretary of the Treas urywould subscribe to capital stock in the system. Each bor rower would be required to buy an amount ofcapital stock in a multicounty financial agency equal to at least 5 per cent, but not more than 10 per cent, of the amount of his loan.

1433-> Plot Foiled, 4 Hostages Are Freed
A plot to rob a check cashing service — apparently modeled on the successful robbery last week of a Brook lyn bank — went awry yes terday when the four holdup men were spotted in the act of kidnapping their victims. The police gave the follow ing account of the incident: John Davila, 32 years old, the owner of the check cashing agency, was forced out of his car early yester day morning by two gunmen near his home at 47 Riving ton Avenue, in the New Springville section of Staten Island. The gunmen bundled Mr. Davila into one car and then went to his house and forced his wife, Carole, and their two sons, aged 6 and 7, into another. But a neighbor, Dominick Tesoriero, wit nessed the scene and called the police. The wife and children were taken to a motel across the Verrazano‐Narrows Bridge in Brooklyn's Sheepshead Bay area, where they were held hostage by two other men. Mr. Davila was driven first to a bank at 49th Street and 13th Avenue, in Brooklyn, where he has an account, then to one of his check cashing stores, at 6218 New Utrecht Avenue. But the gunmen did not stop at either one. When they came to the bank, they real ized that the police had staked it out. Mr. Davila warned them as they ap proached his store that many of his customers were policemen. The would‐be robbers de cided to forget the whole thing. They let Mr. Davila go, then telephoned the motel to tell their accomplices there to abandon the hostages. What the gunmen did not know was that they could have made off with $10,000 in cash without having re sorted to any of their ma neuvering. Mr. Davila had slipped the money to his wife while they were still in Staten Island in case she had to buy her way out of the kidnapping. She still had it when she was released at the motel. The holdup attempt actu ally cost the robbbrs money. Aside from the bridge tolls, they had paid the motel, the Golden Gate Inn, $49 on Thursday to reserve two rooms for the hostages. One of the gunmen registered under the name of Frank Fusco. On April 13, three bandits got away with about $250,000 from the Community Nation al Bank at Fort Hamilton while holding 13 relatives and friends of the bank man ager hostage in a Staten Island home.

1434-> To THE EDITOR:
The Motion Picture Academy redeemed a lot of lost prestige when it chose excellence over popularity in awarding this year's Oscars. Movie Mailbag It has often been under fire for doing just the opposite in recent years, its Oscars often pandering to politics and public sentiment rather than professional skill and performance. The most obvious example of this was John Wayne's win last year for playing himself, while such contenders as Dustin Hoffman and Peter O'Toole had mastered much more challenging roles not at all In keeping with their own characters. The same thing loomed this year when the somewhat controversial “Patton” came up against the crowd pleaser “Airport” and the sentimental “Love Story,” with their record‐setting attendance figures. But for all their popularity, they simply weren't Oscar material and, in granting its awards, the Academy clearly said so. In the single award each won, they got all that they deserved. And John Mills's win over Chief Dan George, who was merely playing himself, was another case in which skill won out over sentiment and politics. Maybe now, even George C. Scott will put more confidence in the Academy's judgment. It has proved, for this year at least, that it still has an eye for quality and artistic achievement.

1435-> Ex‐Jersey Mayor Linked to Zicarelli Gets Bribery Term
MOUNT HOLLY, N. J., April 23 (AP) — A county judge to day gave former Mayor John R. Armellino of West New York a tongue lashing and then sen tenced him to 48 to 56 monthly in state prison for conspiracy to protect underworld gambling in his town. Sentenced with Armellino was a reputed Mafia figure, Joseph Zicarelli, the alleged boss of the gambling. He was sentenced to 12 to 15 years in prison and a $7,000 fine. Burlington County Judge J. Gilbert Van Sciver Jr. said Ar mellino's constitutents had not received good and faithful service from their former Mayor but rather “fraud, de ceit, betrayal, masquerade.” The indictment charged that Mayor Armellino had accepted $1,000 a week for four and a half years to protect Zicarelli's gambling. All except Zicarelli remained free on bail pending appeal. The judge also criticized the 50‐year‐old Armellino for his reticence during his testimony for the state during the three‐ week trial in March. Armellino had pleaded guilty earlier to two counts. He referred to Armellino's “failure to be forthright when given the opportunity” and said his testimony “smacked of hesitating effort at conceal. ment.” Also sentenced today was Frank Mallamaci, 59, of West New York, who got 10 to 11 years in prison and $7,000 in fines. Mallamaci was described during the trial as Zicarelli's “alter ego.” William C. Fourgerel Sr., 56, of Weehawken, got 12 to 14 years and was fined $7,000. Fourgerel ran the gambling op eration in West New York, as well as the operation in Gutten berg, North Bergen and Secau cus, according to testimony. William C. Fourgerel Jr., 30, of Hackensack, and Ludwig Bruschi, 36, of North Bergen, each got 24 to 28 months and $1,000 fines. Armellino's brother Michael, 63, of West New York, received an 18‐to‐24‐month suspended sentence, was fined $1,000 and put on probation for two years. Both Armellinos pleaded guilty March 15 before the trial began and both testified. The former Mayor was fined $2,000.

1436-> Dance: Playfully Seizing on a Ritual
Igor Stravinsky, or his American literary amanuensis, once called the composer's “Symphonies of Wind Instruments” an “austere ritual.” It is in part this aspect of the music that Alvin Ailey has seized upon in his ballet “Myth,” given for the first time last night at the New York City Center by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. It is a simple and mythic work. A woman—walking and prancing in beauty—and three men, together offer a kind of sylvan world. With the lighting by Nicola Cernovitch, suggesting a Rousseaulike jungle, and the expressively stylish costumes by A. Christiana Giannina, suggesting Vogue magazine on a very expensive safari, Mr. Ailey's quartet has more shape than substance. Yet the shape is agreeable, and although the substance may be insubstantial, it is far from unpleasant. • Mr. Ailey's choreography is light and playful. It hints blithely at relationships, but states no more than does the furtively primitive Stravinsky music. Written in 1920, this music—one of the first Stravinsky scores to embrace his new dandy cosmopolitanism — has all the acerbic charm now associated with second‐period Stravinsky. And Mr. Ailey uses this with a deft understanding of its spirit. ?? It is not easy to devise a style of ballet that encapsulates that between‐wars air that Stravinsky's music of this period so cleverly captured. But Mr. Ailey succeeds with this strange quartet—led by Consuelo Atlas's superbly sensuous jungle queen, and her three hunter‐suitors, Clive Thompson, Kenneth Pearl and Freddy Romero. This is precisely the kind of work that mixes kindly with the music and leaves a final impression that is fundamentally more musical than kinetic. You notice the long lines of the Stravinsky melodies and the dancers matching them by creping pantherlike across the virgin stage, or punctuating rhythms with sudden, startled jumps, or making, from the shifting dynamics of the music, a whole parade of physical movement. Miss Atlas, superbly womanly, looking at an only faintly hostile world with finely sexual arrogance and flaring nostrils, is superb. She has a manner with her that is not only indisputable but also beyond criticism. You do not vote for a queen, you accept her —and mere criticism is a lowly form of suffrage. Her suitors also have their virtues, and I particularly liked the cool grandeur of Mr. Thompson. Mr. Thompson also impressed me in the closing work on the program, “Mary Lou's Mass,” where, with a fervent quietude, he assumed the role of the preacher. The leading female role—originally danced by Judith Jamison—was here given by a vibrantly fluent Sara Yarborough. The program opened with a revival of Joyce Trisler's “Dance for Six,” a happily baroque dance exercise set to Vivaldi music. This is most engaging choreography, fast and svelte. Miss Trisler uses the sewing‐machine rhythms with a gentle subtlety, and the dances, although not especially memorable, have a certain and special quality of grace. The ballet was delicately danced, and among the six I especially noted the eloquence of Linda Kent and the forcefulness of Hector Mercado. These are two notably improved dancers this season—but then Mr. Ailey's company seems to be continually on the rise. No wonder it is almost impossible to get tickets for it.

1437-> Police to Stage Tours Of Stations This Week
The Police Department will celebrate Law Enforcement Week starting today by opening its 76 stations to visits by the public. In an attempt to improve police‐citizen cooperation and have the public become better acquainted with the operations of police precincts, guided tours will be given to all visitors to the stations. There will be displays of special equipment and rescue equipment, and some precincts will show films of police activities. Schoolchildren have been especially invited to the tours and safety lectures. Large groups planning visits should contact the stations in advance to make arrangements, the department said in announcing the program.

1439-> Station in Space ...
The latest Soviet space spectacular follows a long series of indications by Kremlin leaders that their present priority in manned space flight is establishment of a long lasting station in space. This latest experiment seems an important — as well as expensive — step on the road toward that objective. Evidently many functions could be served by such an orbiting platform. Most discussion has tended emphasize useful, peaceful objectives. These goals range from creation of astronomical laboratories whose tele scopes would be free of the atmospheric haze and distortion that plague terrestrial telescopes, to providing a site for study of earth's ecology and resources with cameras and other sensors that operate most efficiently hundreds or thousands of miles above ground level. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that space stations will be restricted to benign purposes. Soviet and Ameri can employment of unmanned espionage satellites already well‐established, and presumably the military surveillance capabilities of long‐term manned satellites will be even greater. Moreover, manned space stations can also carry weapons, presumably including rockets and nuclear arms. Whatever the limitations set by present international agreements, the possibility that some future space platforms will really be military bases in orbit cannot be ignored. These dangers are inherent in the concept of nationally created and nationally controlled space stations to which the rest of the world has no access. Logically, there should be no national stations in space. All such facilities should be operated by the United Nations employing crews from many nations and they should all be open to appropriate international inspection. In a modest way, the principle involved has already been recognized in the Antarctic where the presence of Soviet scientists at American bases and American scientists Soviet bases has a long, useful and honorable history. With the latest Soyuz and Salyut vehicles in orbit, the sensitive issues raised by space stations must be faced in the nearest future.

1440-> Notes on People
It was reunion time for the Soviet Minister of Agriculture, and some of the people who welcomed him, back in 1955, to Iowa. His hosts treated him to an Americanstyle birthday party, with a cake ablaze with 62 candles. Mr. Matskevich, who is in this country to study ways to increase livestock and poultry production in the Soviet Union, recalled that when he was in Iowa 16 years ago, then 3 years old, presented him with an car of corn. “I had nothing to give you,” he told the now‐19‐year‐old, bearded Mr. Alleman. “Now I give you my watch. It isn't much to look at, but it keeps good time.” His birthday party hosts gave Mr. Matskevich a typically Ameririfle. • In Good Housekeeping magazine's annual poll to determine the world's most admired women, took first place and her former daughter‐in‐law, was ranked 19th. In the top 10, was the second‐most‐admired woman, followed by Premier of Israel, of India, and of Monaco. This was the second year in a row in which a ballot of 1,000 members of the magazine's consumer panel found Mrs. Kennedy the most admired woman. • the New Orleans businessman who was unsuccessfully prosecuted by District Attorney Jim Garrison on charges of conspiring to kill President Kennedy, has taken a new job. Mayor Moon Landrieu of New Orleans named him manager of a $2.5‐million renovation of the city's historic French Market. Mr. Shaw has been a member of the French Market Board for six months. • During his weekly general audience, took somewhat puzzled note of the “Jesus people” in the United States. He said he had seen American publications with pictures of hippies wearing “I love Jesus” shirts. “Why,” he said, “is not explained. But, then, many attitudes of these paradoxical young people are unexplained.” He added that “according to the latest fashion” multimedia productions were being devoted to the figure of Jesus, and even if they denied Him, they provoked reappraisals and the realization that “the presence of Christ is with us—it enlightens us if we open our eyes to His light, it pursues us if we close them.” • Spain's two most prominent families will be linked with the marriage, in the spring or early summer, of Generalissimo Francisco Franco's eldest granddaughter, , to a grandson of Spain's last King, Alfonso XIII. Their engagement was announced officially yesterday by General Franco, and it will be celebrated Dec. 23 in an “intimate family reunion” at El Pardo palace. Although little political significance was attached to the engagement—it was said to be the result of a true love match—the wedding of the 35‐year‐old Prinde Alfonso, who is Ambassador to Sweden, and the 21‐year‐old Miss Bordiu will undoubtedly be the social event of the decade in Spain. • made it official that Christmas is coming.

1441-> Chess: Is the Game Art or Science? It Can Be Both—or Neither
The safest answer to the old question “Is chess an art or a science?” is the noncommittal “It's a sport.” But there are features of chess that link it to the fine arts on the one hand, and the sciences on the other, and they can hardly be ignored. One plays a game of chess to win, and therein lies the sporting element, but out of this struggle between two contending intellects can come an object'—the game itself—that can give pleasure to others who couldn't care less which player won. Chess games also provide certain ‘hard data’ for analyses that are sufficiently objective to link chess to science. The relationship of the pieces in any given chess position is somewhat similar to relationship of, for example, atoms in a molecule, in that both can be examined in terms of various causal laws. Those who prefer to think of chess as an art or a science usually have in mind the games of the great masters. For every Bobby Fischer or Boris Spassky in the world, however, there are thousands of people who play at some lower level, and in their games, the sporting element is paramount. Out of every major international tournament come both games of lasting beauty —works of art, if you will—and much material for analysis—the hard data of the science of chess. But for every major tournament, there are many minor ones, in which the players are mostly interested to beat each others' brains out over the chessboard. Sometimes out of one of these lesser events comes a game of lasting value, sometimes a new idea in the opening worthy of extensive analysis. But the many people who take time out from their jobs to play chess for a weekend or a week do it mostly for the fun of matching wits against other people like themselves.

1442-> The World
One day not long ago, an American who had been in Japan before got a laugh from a Japanese customs inspector when he returned to this country. As the visitor piled his luggage onto the inspection rack, he was asked: “Have you anything to declare?” Anticipating the litany of questions all incoming foreigners are asked, the American replied: “No, and I don't have any guns, swords, knives, watches, gold jewelry, drugs, or alcohol.” The customs officer chuckled, “Ah, you know Japan very well,” and waved the visitor on through without opening the bags. In marked contrast, the American businessman who wants to sell his products in the world's fastest growing industrial and consumer market here has no easy time of it. Nor are Japanese import restrictions any laughing matter, having been the source of an increasingly bitter dispute between the United States and Japanese Governments for more than five years. The Nixon Administration, particularly in recent months, has been especially anxious to knock down Japanese import barriers so that American exporters could sell more and thus help to rectify an imbalance of trade that has contributed to the weakness of the dollar. But Japan has been reluctant, especially on agricultural products that are a major American export and on industrial products where the Japanese feel they are not yet competitive. Premier Eisaku Sato, in response to a question during a “meet‐the‐people” session last week, said the Government had to protect home industries even though liberalized imports might mean lower prices for consumers. Thus, when the Japanese Government removed quota restrictions from 20 items two weeks ago, it raised tariffs on eight of them. They included feeder cattle, for which American cattlemen had seen a potentially lucrative market here as Japanese diet and tastes change. But the Government imposed a $225 tariff on each head of cattle, making the ‐Imports uneconomical and taking away with the left hand what it had given with the right. Over the years, Japan has built up what might be called a defense in depth to protect its home market. The barriers include import quotas, tariffs, governmental “administrative guidance,” internal restrictions, and a tendency to “by Japanese.” A Ford LTD, for instance, is not subject to a quota. But a duty of 10 per cent of the cost of the car, its insurance during shipment, and transport charges is assessed. On top of that comes a 40 per cent commodity tax intended to hit cars of that size. Smaller Japanese cars are subject to a much lower tax, usually around 15 per cent. Then, the Ministry of Transportation does not recognize United States safety standards. So the Ford LTD must undergo an item‐by‐item inspection here—it takes 90 to 120 days and costs the dealer about $1,000 in fees, labor costs, and capital carrying charges. All told, a Ford LTD with air conditioning and power equipment is listed by the dealer here at 4.6‐million yen, or about $13,600 at the current floating rate of exchange. The same car in the United States is listed at $5,100. Even with the Kennedy Round of tariff reductions, Japanese tariffs remain relatively high. Moreover, Japan maintains a varying levy on some items so that if an exporter lowers his prices, the tariff increases to keep the price above that of domestic goods. Japan has preferential tariffs for 892 items from developing countries that are 20 to 100 per cent lower than regular tariffs. But those items also have import ceilings. When they are reached, the regular tariff is applied. Then there is the shadowy device known as “administrative guidance.” It usually takes a cumbersome round of meetings to impose but it means that the Government makes clear to importers that buying a certain foreign item would not be in Japan's best economic interests. That advice—and the promise of later favors—is not lightly disregarded. In addition Japanese companies, especially those in the mammoth “zaibatsu,” or combines, such as Mitsubishi, buy as much as they can from sister companies or affiliates. The reasons for Japanese protectionism are economic, political and cultural. American grapefruit and oranges would compete with the “mikan,” or mandarin oranges grown by Japanese farmers—and the ruling Liberal Democratic party's main strength is in the rural areas. Leather goods would compete with those made by the “burakumin,” or outcasts, whom some officials consider to be dangerous. The Japanese computer industry is in a fledgling state and the Japanese business community, the source of the ruling party's political funds, wants it to develop. But perhaps more important, the Japanese do not want foreign businesses, with their different ways, to upset the social equilibrium of a society that has its own paternalistic, personalized way of doing things. Despite Japan's defense in depth, imports here last year ran to $19.3‐billion, of which $5.7‐billion came from the United States. Imports from America this year have been running well above $400‐million a month for most of the year. Why? Japan, a country poor in resources, needs huge amounts of raw materials, such as American coal, to feed its roaring industry. Increasingly affluent Japanese consumers want food and goods that are not produced at home. Japanese industry, like every other in the world, does not make everything it needs. And the pressure from the United States and other trading partners has gradually chipped away some of the defense. But for the most part, Japan lets in what it wants or needs from whom it wants and under the conditions that it sets. That is likely to remain so for a long time.

1443-> NIXON WILL VISIT CHINA BEFORE NEXT MAY TO SEEK A ‘NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS’” KISSINGER MET CHOU IN PEKING
SAN CLEMENTE, Calif., July 15—President Nixon said to night that he would visit China before next May at the invita tion of Premier Chou En‐lai to “seek the normalization of re lations between the two coun tries and also to exchange views on questions of concern to the two sides.” Mr. Nixon's brief and unex pected announcement was made on nationwide radio and television from Los Angeles. Mr. Nixon disclosed that the arrangements had been made by Henry A. Kissinger, the chief White House adviser on national security, who secretly visited Peking during his recent worldwide tour. The announcement was being made simultaneously in the United States and in Peking. Mr. Nixon said. “Our action in seeking a new relationship with the People's Republic of China will not be at the expense of our old friends,” he said in an obvious allusion to Natonalist China. “It its not directed against any other nation. “We will seek friendly rela tions with all nations. Any nation can be our friend with out being any other nation's enemy. “I have taken this action,” he continued, “because of my profound conviction that all nations will gain from a reduc tion of tensions and a better relationship between the United States and the People's Re public of China. “It is in this spirit that I will undertake what I deeply hope will become a journey for peace, peace not just for our generation but for future gen erations on this earth we share together.” Mr. Nixon's visit will be the first by an American President to China. It had not been known that Mr. Kissinger was in China at all on his 11‐day trip that took him to South Vietnam, India, France and other countries this month. The President said Mr. Kis singer and Premier Chou con ferred in Peking from July to 11. That was when he was reported to be in Pakistan tem porarily incapacitated by stomach ailment. Mr. Kissinger arrived at the Western White House Tuesday and has been in daily consultation with President Nixon since then. He was with the President tonight when he flew by helicopter from the Presidential compound to the National Broadcasting Com pany studio in suburban Los Angeles to make the announce ment. In a statement of fewer than 400 words, Mr. Nixon said he had requested the broadcast, at 7:30 P.M. Pacific time, to an nounce a “major development in our efforts to build a last ing peace in the world.” He said that he had pointed out on a number of occasions over the last three years that “there can be no stable and enduring peace without the participation of the People's Republic of China and its 750 million peoples.” “That is why I have under taken initatives in several areas to open the door for more nor mal relations between our two countries.” He read this statement: “Premier Chou En‐lai and Dr. Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's assistant for national security affairs, held talks in Peking from July 9 to 11, 1971. Knowing of President Nixon's expressed desire to visit the People's Republic of China, Premier Chou En‐lai, on behalf of the Government of the Peo ple's Republic of China, has ex tended an invitation to Presi dent Nixon to visit China at an appropriate date before May, 1972. “President Nixon has accept ed the invitation with pleasure. “The meeting between the leaders of China and the Unit ed States us to seek the normalization of relations be tween the two countries and also to exchange views on questions of concern to the two sides.” Earlier in the day, it became known that the President had called a meeting of the National Security Council for tomorrow at the summer. White house here, where an intensive review of foreign policy has been under way for several days. This re view, it was disclosed, had in cluded extensive discussion of the seven‐point Vietcong peace proposal put fa‐. ward at the talks in Paris on July 1. The President, who arrived here on July 6, is due to return to Washington on Sunday. The arranging of a Presiden tial trip to China was by far the most dramatic development in the remarkably rapid thaw, in relations between the two countries that has occurred in recent weeks. The United States has never had diplomatic rela tions with the Chinese Com munist Government that came to power in 1949, and the Unit ed States has opposed entry of Peking into the United Nations. President Nixon on several occasions recently has said that China had become so pow erful and so energetic that it would be a mistake for it to continue in isolation from Western nations. In a proclamation last week designating Oct. 24 as United Nations Day, Mr. Nixon pointed to a report by his commis sion for the observance of the 25th anniversary of the United Nations, headed by Henry Cab ot Lodge, and commended it to the attention of all American citizens. That report contained, among other things, the recommenda tion that the United States adopt a “two‐Chinas policy” that is, to recognize both main land China and the Chinese Na tionalist Government on Tai wan. The United States has rec ognized the Nationalist Govern ment, which is represented in the United Nations. The President's trip to China will have important political im plications in this country. President Nixon will presum ably run for re‐election in 1972. Much of the conservative wing of the President's Republican party is opposed to a thaw be tween the two countries. There is evidence that President Nixon agonized long over the decision but that he obviously feels the appearance of President going forth in search of world peace will enhance his stature. The President spoke less than than 24 hours after it had become known that Peking for the first time had expressed an interest in playing a part in a settlement of the Vietnam war by participating in a new Geneva conference on Indo China. Premier Chou En‐lai had expressed such an interest to Gough Whitlam, the leader of the Opposition Labor party of Australia, and the Australian Embassy in Washington quick ly transmitted the development to the State Department. Administration experts on China said in Washington this morning that they were taking the Chinese offer of participa tion seriously and saw it as positive development.

1445-> Study Sees Large Saving If Space Shuttle Is Used
WASHINGTON, June 15 —The space agency released today the conclusions of a economic analysis of the space shuttle program showing that about $12‐billion would be saved over the next 20 years if the controversial project went into operation and the space effort were maintained at the level of the last eight years. The money saved, which might be regarded as a paper profit, would be the difference between the costs of space operations using the shuttle and the costs of space operations using the nonrecoverable booster rockets, such as the Saturn and Atlas series that are now used. The shuttle could be employed many times to put payloads into orbit, rather than just once. Hundreds of millions of dollars a year are now spent on booster rockets that are fired once and then fall into the ocean after putting their payloads into orbit. Costs Projected The study was undertaken by Mathematica, Inc., a Princeton, N.J., research group, under a $600,000 contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which is seeking support for the shuttle as its main space vehicle of the future. Mathematica released a 600page interim report in March. The conclusions are contained in a 63‐page “executive summary” of an “economic analysis of new space transportation systems” that was made public today. The study projects the cost of the shuttle over the next two decades, assuming that it would be used by NASA and the Air Force for both civilian and military space programs, at $12.9‐billion to $15.4‐billion, depending on the number of flights flown each year. Assuming that the civilian and military space effort over the next 20 years is maintained at the level of the last eight, the study infers that the accrued savings from space shuttle operations would about equal its costs. Current shuttle concepts call for a piggy‐back vehicle that would resemble in size a Boeing 747 linked to a C‐5A, the world's largest plane. Equipped with a dozen engines, the larger craft would act as the booster to put the smaller into orbit. The booster would then be guided back to earth by a two‐man crew and landed like a plane. The payload would be landed in similar fashion after its orbital mission was over. Proponents of the shuttle argue that without it the United States would be all but unable to construct large orbiting space stations manned by dozen or more astronauts or assemble in orbit a large manned spaceship for a flight to Mars. Foes See Boondoggle But Congressional opponents of the shuttle contend that it would be a multibillion‐dollar boondoggle. They argue that the space program should concentrate on the development of far less expensive unmanned vehicles, so the savings could be used for urban development, improved health care and a more liberal welfare program. One of the main conclusions of the mathematica report is that the United States should’ make up its mind what size space program it wants and then decide whether to build the shuttle. “Finally, we state with emphasis,” says the report's last conclusion,. “any investment can only be justified by its goals.” “A new reusable space transportation system should only be introduced if it can be shown, conclusively, what it is to be used for, and that the intended uses are meaningful to those who have to appropriate the funds and to those from whom the funds are raised, as well as to the various Government agencies that undertake space activities.” Costs Vary Widely The report's summary gives the costs of a series of possible “scenarios” based on assumptions about the size and shape of future civilian and military space programs. The costs of what the report foresees as the most probable scenarios vary by several billion dollars a year. One of the more probable projections, Scenario 23, assumes that the spending levels of the military and civilian space programs for the next 20 years will be about the same as those of the last eight. If this assumption turns out to be valid, the authors of the report calculate that about $12billion in 1970 dollars would be saved through space shuttle operations between now and 1990. A larger national space effort, which is politically unlikely, would generate greater savings; a smaller program, lesser savings.

1446-> Jury Set to Study Attack on Newark Teachers
NEWARK, Feb. 15—An Es sex County grand jury will be gin hearing information this week concerning the attack on striking Newark teachers by group of black youths two weeks ago, it was disclosed today. The disclosure was made by John Redden, the director of the Newark police, as the teachers' strike entered its third week with no sign of a settle ment. The Newark Teachers Union and the. Board of Education have not met since last Satur and the teachers have warned that they will resume picketing tomorrow if their Is no prog ress in the talks by tonight. In other developments, the Organization of Negro Edu cators, a Newark‐based group of black teachers, charged that black teachers who wanted to continue teaching had been verbally and physically ha rassed when they had tried to enter schools in the predomi nantly white North Ward. Elaine Pettigrew, a teacher in the third grade at the First Avenue Elementary School, told a news conference that she had been warned not to teach by parents and that other teachers in her school had interrupted her classes and threatened her students. Miss Pettigrew said her over coat had been torn and her pocketbook taken after she asked for police protection. Other blacks who continued to teach reported that their windows had been smashed and that they had received threat ening phone calls. Mrs. Carole Graves, president of the Newark Teachers Union, said” meanwhile that the union had filed a complaint with the Civil Rights Division of the De partment of Justice, charging that the teachers' civil rights had been violated by the as saults. The central issue in the strike is the teachers' demand that a provision in their last year's contract calling for compulsory arbitration of grievance proce dures be renewed. The Board of Education disapproves of the provision and has maintained that it expired with last year's contract

1447-> POINT OF VIEW
The proposal currently be ing debated before the Con gress to initiate a “Recon struction Finance Corpora tion” type guaranteeing agen cy threatens to open a Pan dora's Box, which it would be extremely difficult to close. The implicit expectation of the proponents of this legis lation is that it would be a minimum program designed to help out a few special cases. The cost to the tax payer, it is argued, would be small and the benefits large. Faltering companies in key industries or key areas es sential to the national inter est, it is maintained, could be supported, thereby fend ing off potentially cumula tive bankruptcies with their associated deleterious effects on jobs and business con fidence. But it is just not credible that such a foot‐in‐the‐door program can be kept on a limited basis. The number of candidates that would emerge for such guarantees could reach staggering dimensions. Who would be the final arbi ter of so vague a standard as what serves the “national interest?” Can one realistic ally imagine the rejection of a petition of a company in a key Congressman's district cited by him as being in the national interest? More than 20 years ago the Hoover Commission with the history of the Recon struction Finance Corpora tion in mind noted that “di rect lending by the Govern ment to persons or enter prises opens up dangerous possibilities of waste and fa voritism … it invited politi cal and private pressures, or even corruption.” To place the Federal Gov ernment in a position where it can pick and choose which particular private enterprises should or should not be allowed to slip into bankruptcy must inevitably lead to sub sidization of the least effi cient concerns in an indus try. We often lose sight of the tremendous churning that goes on in a free, competi tive economy—of the way in which concerns, vying for profitability, attempt to mar shall their resources in the most productive manner. It is the very threat of bankruptcy that often jolts concerns, large and small, from inefficient practices in their utilization of labor and capital and in their methods of financing and marketing. To have the possibility of falling back on a guarantor of last resort must inevitably remove this very valuable prod. To institute such a mechanism could only impair the viability of our free enter prise system and slow the growth of American living standards. Moreover, it is important to remember that when the Federal Government guaran tees private credit, it does not add to the total financial resources available. It only moves one borrower up in the credit rating queue at the expense of other borrow ers who are not fortunate enough to have such a guar antee. While the quantity of long term savings flowing into the capital markets does vary from year to year, it is not an unlimited source of funds. Government loan guarantees, direct and indirect, necessari ly single out certain areas of the economy for special treatment. At present, it is primarily housing, via Gov ernment‐guaranteed mort gages. Presumably, in the fu ture we shall be seeing other areas where the financing re quirements are met by “set asides” in the market through the guarantee mechanism. Government loan guarantees tend to reduce the size of the pool of long‐term savings available for non‐guaranteed private borrowing. This is because the avail ability of Government guar antees increases the effective credit demand at any given interest rate, and inasmuch as the aggregate supply of savings is limited; it acts to raise interest rates to non guaranteed borrowers. Thus, Government guaran tees to some companies could have, the effect of depriving funds at reasonable cost to other private borrowers. Or worse, in order to prevent this unhappy consequence the Federal Reserve could be pressured to accommodate the increasing demand for funds through an expansion of the money supply. This in turn would act to feed the very inflationary forces that have been instrumental in bringing a number of com panies to the verge of bank ruptcy and would thereby accelerate the number of pe titioners for Government loan guarantees. Such a vicious circle would be difficult to break once we begin moving toward ever more extensive uses of Gov ernment guarantees. The inevitable secondary consequence of the develop ment of a broad loan guar anteeing authority would be a move, sooner or later, by the Federal Government to increase its regulatory con trol over the private‐enter prise system. Someone is bound to argue (with some validity) that if the Govern ment is a guarantor of last resort for a certain class of business enterprise, it should also oversee the operations of such corporations. A standby guarantor could reasonably be expected to re quire the regulation of, for example, pricing and market ing practices, debt‐equity ra tios and dividend payouts. In fact, it might want to regu late anything that, if mis handled, could lead to the necessity of a loan guaran tee — that is — almost every important business decision. We cannot look upon Gov ernment loans or guarantees as a temporary expedient pending a return to prosper ity. In fact, the types of prob lems that have now led to the call for Government guarantees are structural and threaten to be long‐standing. Although our level of ac tivity by any historic stand ard is high, profit margins have only just emerged, and then by the narrowest of margins, from their lowest levels since the nineteen thirties. The debt burden of our business structure has risen sharply. As a result, interest charges, loan amorti zations and other legally fixed obligations have now reached the point where a substantial number of large, as well as smaller, business enterprises are barely able to meet their commitments at the present depressed lev els of cash flow. Unfortunately, the current outlook suggests that the problem of subnormal corpo rate profitability and attend ant financial difficulties is apt to persist to some extent throughout this decade. So long as this condition pre vails, increasing demands will be heard to substitute Government guarantees for private financial worthiness. The solution to our corpo rate financial malaise, how ever, is not the symptom fighting Government‐guaran tee mechanism, inasmuch as this must surely lead to new problems that are likely to be far worse than our cur rent economic disease. The only viable long‐term solution is to remove the inflation bias from our economic sys tem. This has acted as a damper on productivity in creases and exacerbated an already difficult collective bargaining process. It is difficult to envisage, even under the best of cir cumstances, a return to the higher profit margins and cash flow of five or 10 years ago. Nonetheless, sufficient gains can be achieved to sub stantially ease the financial burden currently confronting American business. To solve today's financial difficulties by introducing a new wedge of Government into our economic system could only trade far greater difficulties for our free enter prise system in the future for beguiling short‐term solu tions to today's problems.

1448-> China's Delegates to U.N. Are Listed, With Job Titles
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Nov. 17—A list of the mem bers of Peking's delegation to the United Nations became available today, providing the names of the members and their job designations. It has not been disclosed what the specific duties of each member are in every case, but Kao Liang, for example, who is listed merely as a “secretary,” has been acting as coordinator and press officer for the delegation and was the head of the advance team that came here before the full delegation arrived.

1449-> IN THE NATION
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 — Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr., the scourge of the snoopers, is about to open hearings on the proliferation of data banks, and it's none too soon. Every day, new disclosures make it more imperative that safeguards be imposed on com puter storage, and distribution of per sonal information. Last week, for instance, Deputy Attorney General Richard Kleindienst told the American Bar Association that the Justice Department had made 253 applications to Federal Courts in 1969 and 1970 to make electronic “Intercep tions”—wiretaps and bugs. As a result, he said, there had been over 800 ar rests and 72 convictions and all but twelve of the applications had been “productive.” These statistics show that more than 700 persons were arrested but have not yet been convicted of any crime. Unquestionably, a high proportion of these persons never will or should be convicted; yet, under present practices, their, arrest records will go into Gov ernment files, which now means computer data‐processing center. These records will then become in stantly available to hundreds of state, local and private agencies—even in some cases to prospective employers —few of which are under any par ticular strictures about their privacy or as to how they may be used. Moreover, 253 applications to bug and tap must have resulted in liter ally thousands of conversations being intercepted. And Mr. Kleindienst said most of the applications had been “pro ductive.” This means that an untoward amount of unprocessed and unverified data on individuals, not all of it lead ing to arrests and not all of them necessarily criminals, also Is finding its way to the waiting computers. But that just the beginning. New Jersey, which put an eavesdropping law into effect in 1969, has just re ported that in the second year, of operations, its agents tripled the num ber of wiretaps they conducted. In 1970, New Jersey officers alone re corded 24,192 conversations, of which 19,443 were reported to be incriminat ing: 287 arrests resulted, but no con viction data were given. New Jersey is one of only twelve states with eavesdrop laws but the American Bar Association is urging the other 38 to get cracking at the earphones. So the raw material to go into the data banks, for distribution to interested agencies and persons, is accumulating, rapidly. The police are not the only eager collectors: Senator Ervin already has disclosed that the Dragon Lady of the State. Department, Director. Frances Knight of the Passport Office, has at her disposal a computer bank of 243‐ 138 names of persons considered— not necessarily proven—to be subver sive or to fail to “reflect credit” on the United States. And how much do we know about the links, official or unacknowledged, between state and Federal agencies and private concerns —credit bureaus, for instance—that Collect data on individuals for com puter storage? Very little. Mr. Kleindienst said the‐Justice De partment interceptions were directed at organized crime, so it may seem quixotic to object to gathering, stor ing and distributing data on those en‐, gaged in that nefarious field, But: the question is whether this is being done under rules that give maximum pro tection to innocent people. An arrest, for example, is not proof of guilt; thousands of totally innocent people are arrested every year, but are never convicted. Yet the arrest record becomes a permanent liability that can hound an innocent person throughout his life. Even the F.B.I. tacitly concedes this by its policy of expunging arrest records from its files —but only when notified by the ar resting agency that no conviction resulted, a notification local police seldom bother to make. Dr. Alan F. Westin of Columbia University, the director of a study on data‐bank implications, said in speech at Dickinson College last week that computer technology itself made possible data‐processing systems that would automatically wipe out certain obsolete records, record all requests for and distribution of data, notify the individual concerned of such trarina tions, and otherwise safeguard com puter information and its use. This may well be the most potent sugges tion Senator Ervin's subcommittee will hear.

1451-> NIXON WILL IGNORE CALL BY CONGRESS FOR VIETNAM CUTS
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17— President Nixon, in a rebuke to Congressional doves, an nounced today that he would disregard an amendment set ting forth the policy that United States troops should be with drawn promptly from Indo china, subject only to the re lease of American prisoners of war. That restriction was con tained in a military procure ment authorization bill that the President signed into law today. The House of Representa tives, responding to a Presi dential warning that such legis lative restrictions could hinder the search for a negotiated set tlement, handed the Adminis tration a victory by refusing to cut off funds for military op erations in Indochina after June 1. By a 238‐to‐164 vote the House rejected an amendment to the defense appropriations bill that would have provided that none of the funds could be used to finance military, combat or support operations in or over Indochina after June 1 if American prisoners of war had been released by then. The amendment was offered by Republican Edward P. Boland, Democrat of Massachusetts. After two days of debate the House went on to pass the bill, which provides $71‐billion in new funds for the Pentagon — about $2.5‐billion less than requested by the Administra tion. The votes were the first direct test of Congressional reaction to Mr. Nixon's announcement last week that 45,000 troops would be withdrawn in the next two months but that residual force would be main tained in South Vietnam until there was a negotiated settle ment of the war. The relatively one‐sided vote indicated that the Administra tion was still in control in Congress on the Vietnam issue, particularly in the House, which has been more hawkish than the Senate. Since the last test in the House in October — when a nonbinding amendment on troop withdrawal was defeated by a vote of 215 to 193 — the doves have lost strength, large ly because of many members’ reluctance to cut off funds for the war. The apparent effect of the President's statement challeng ing the withdrawal policy laid down by Congress was to hard en the lines between the execu tive branch and the doves and to encourage a new Senate move to impose a policy of complete withdrawal on the President. When the defense appropria tions bill reaches the Senate, move is expected to attach an amendment specifiying that the President can use the funds only to withdraw troops from Vietnam. Mr. Nixon's statement, issued by the White House press office a few hours before the House vote, was made as he signed the bill authorizing $21.4‐billion for weapons production and re search by the Pentagon. To it Congress had attached a modi fied version of a troop‐with drawal amendment sponsored by Senator Mike Mansfield, the majority leader. The amendment, still in the Senate‐passed military‐aid bill, calls for total withdrawal in six months, contingent on the re lease of prisoners. As modified in a Senate‐House conference on the fund bill, it declares it to be “the policy of the United States to terminate at the ear liest practicable date all mili tary operations of the United States in Indochina and to pro vide for the prompt and orderly withdrawal of all United States military forces at a date cer tain, subject to the release of all American prisoners of war.” Mr. Nixon, in his remarks, did not take direct notice of the fact that the modified amend ment represented a statement of national policy rather than an expression of Congressional opinion. But he made it clear that he did not feel bound by it. “To avoid any miscon ceptions,” the President em phasized that the Mansfield amendment, in his opinion, “ex pressed a judgment about the manner in which the American involvement in the war should be ended” but “does not rep resent the policies of this Ad ministration.” The amendment, he con tinued,’ “is without binding force or effect, and it does not reflect my judgment about the way in which the war should be brought to an end.” Signing the bill containing the Mans field amendment, therefore, he said, “will not change the poli cies I have pursued and that shall continue to pursue toward this end.” “Our goal—and my hope—is a negotiated settlement provid ing for the total withdrawal of all foreign forces, including our own,” the President said, “for the release of all prison ers, and for a cease‐fire throughout Indochina. “In the absence of such a settlement, or until such a set tlement is reached, the rate of withdrawal of U.S. forces will be determined'by three factors: by the level of enemy activity, by the progress of our pro gram of Vietnamization and by progress toward obtaining the release of all of our prisoners wherever they are in South east Asia, and toward’ obtain ing a cease‐fire for all of Southeast Asia.” Mr. Nixon added that “legis lative actions such as this hin der rather than assist in the search for a negotiated settle ment.” Basically the same argument was used by, the Administra tion's supporters in opposing the Boland amendment. Repre sentative Gerald R. Ford, the House Republican leader, said it would stop troop withdraw als and jeopardize efforts to free the prisoners. To applause from the Demo cratic side, Mr. Boland found it “incomprehensible and inde fensible” for the President to say he would “Ignore a law passed by Congress.” Senator Frank Church, Demo crat of Idaho, who will lead the move in the Senate to impose a fund cutoff, protested in a statement that “the Mans field amendment is now part of the law and, as such, is not subject to dismissal by the President.” Noting that Mr. Nixon had asserted that the amendment was not binding, Mr. Church asked: “What is he going to do next? Dispatch Henry Kissinger, his foreign policy adviser, to Capi tol Hill to disband the Congress? “It is the height of fashion these days in Southeast Asia to establish one‐man rule, one‐ man elections, and disband people's assemblies. It has hap pened in South Vietnam, in Cambodia and in Thailand to day. But ours is a government of law.” After cursory debate the House also rejected, 161 to 52, an amendment by Representa tive Andrew Jacobs Jr., Demo crat of Indiana, that would have set Nov. 7, 1972—Election Day —as a date for cutting off funds for the Vietnam war. Before passing the defense appropriations bill by a 324‐to 51 vote and sending it to the Senate, the House defeated amendments that would have reduced the, appropriations to last year's level, $69.5‐billion, and would have imposed a spending ceiling of $72.2‐billion —5 per cent below the Penta gon's plans in the current fiscal year. Also defeated, by 211 to 183, was an amendment by Repre sentative Sidney R. Yates, Democrat of Illinois, that would have barred the President in an emergency, from exceeding authorized manpower strengths for more than 60 days without Congressional approval.

1453-> Minh Charges U.S. Gives Election Help to Thieu
SAIGON, South Vietnam, July 15 (AP) — Gen. Duong Van Minh, a possible contender for the Presidency of South Vietnam, charged today that American support of President Nguyen Van Thieu could pre vent a fair and honest elec tion on Oct. 3. He suggested that President Thieu was certain to be re elected if the United States Ambassador, Ellsworth Bunk er, remained in Saigon. The comments, made by the 155‐year‐old retired general to reporters, came a day after an attack on President Thieu by another possible contender, Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky. The Vice President accused Mr. Thieu yesterday of dictatorial practices and of maneuvering to rig the election. General Minh told the news men: “My American friends have told me that the United States wants me to run. Then if Thieu is elected by only a small mar gin, it will look like he won in a fair election.” Describing Ambassador Bunk er as “a great specialist in elec tiorls of this type,” the general went on: “All my American friends have told me that he strongly supports Thieu and that a free and honest election will be very difficult with the presence of Ambassador Bunker. Bunker has said, ‘Hands off the elec tion,’ but that is not enough.” General Minh said that Pres ident Thieu was campaigning with the help of a machine “made in the U.S.A.” This, he said, consisted of printing presses, radio and television stations, planes and helicopters, all supplied by the United States to the South Vietnamese Government. He echoed the charge he made in an interview on July 5 that Mr. Thieu was trying to “manipulate the election” and said that, if he runs, he might pull out of the race “as late as Oct. 2” because of his doubts about its fairness. He expressed the belief that Vice President Ky might to the same, thus leaving Mr. Thieu unopposed and making the election a “colossal farce.” The general said that a fair election and a policy of coexist ence with North Vietnam were South Vietnam's only hopes for survival.

1457-> Realty Syndication Plan By Bank America Barred
The Federal Reserve has blocked the BankAmerica Cor poration, at least temporarily, from setting up and selling partnership interests in real estate syndications. The typical syndication plan is organized in a manner some what similar to a mutual fund and is sold by securities deal ers to investors seeking tax sheltered income. Meanwhile, in a separate de velopment yesterday, the Fed eral Reserve Board proposed to define “property manage ment services” permissible for bank holding companies as in cluding the management of “farms, office buildings and other business or industrial properties, residences ranging from single‐family dwellings to high‐rise apartment buildings and the management of air rights or oil and mineral rights of a particular parcel of land.” In its proposal, the Reserve said property management does not, in the board's judg ment, include such activities as the buying and selling of prop erty or the development of real estate.” A spokesman, for the Bank of America noted yesterday that the delay was imposed by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco on the bank's plan to syndication services to be of fered by a new company called BankAmerica Realty Services, Inc. The spokesman said that otherwise the plan would have gone into effect automatically following a 45‐day waiting peri od, which has already expired, and the delay was simply the result of a “failure of communi cation” between the regulatory authorities and the company, the world's largest commercial bank. Neal L. Petersen, an attorney for the bank, said that under the proposed plan partnership interests would be sold pri vately to a limited number of investors of substantial means, so that the offerings would not have to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Com mission. The function of the new company as a general partner in the proposed syndication ventures, he added, would, in an economic sense, be identical with the real estate advisory role it already plays (with the approval of the Federal Re serve) in relation to BankAmer ica Realty Investors, a real estate investment trust Spon sored by the bank, as well as affiliates of the holding company. However, Irwin L. Jennings, a senior vice president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, said that the selling of partnership interests in real estate syndications was not in cluded in the present list of activities permitted bank hold ing companies. He said the bank would thus have to apply directly to the Federal Reserve Board in Washington for per mission to do so. This was confirmed by a spokesman for the board, who added that the board had not yet considered whether this as pect of the real estate business was “so closely related to banking as to be a proper in cident thereto.” The issue actually involves the broader question of wheth er bank holding companies should be allowed to partici pate in some aspects of the securities business — notwith standing the separation of banking and securities activi ties decreed by the Banking Act of 1933. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court blocked the First National City Bank from operating a “comingled invest ment account” that the Court said was essentially the same as a mutual fund. The real estate syndication— which should be distinguished from the real estate investment trust, one of which the Bank of America already operates— involves the creation of a part nership in which the promoter serves as the general partner, and the public puts up the cash by buying limited partnership interests. The general partner acquires and operates the property (and receives a fee for his expertise) while the limited partners get the income from the properties plus the tax benefits from the depreciation, interest deduc tions and so forth on the prop erty. By contrast, the real estate investment trust simply makes real estate investments or loans and passes the income along to its owners without any special tax shelter.

1460-> METS BOW, 9 TO 3, AS STAUB EXCELS
MONTREAL, Sept. 7—Mrs. Joan Payson flew over from Maine tonight to watch her New York Mets in Canada and had a sensationally unreward ing trip as the Montreal Expos shellacked her boys, 9‐3. She was accorded a warm reception by the crowd of 13,254 persons in Jarry Park, just as the Mets were accorded a hot reception by the Expos— in particular, by Rusty Staub and John Bateman, who con tributed a home run and a triple each inside five innings. And to give the occasion the full glow of a reunion, the Mets were shackled by Steve Renko, a former teammate who pitched his 14th victory of the season with lavish support. For Mrs. Payson the trip must have been as confusing as it was unrewarding because the sum mer's epidemic of injuries made deep inroads into the troops. Manager Gil Hodges, deploying people wildly, used two second basemen, two third basemen, two shortstops and four men who switched among the out field spots in shifts—winding up with Tim Foli, a utility in fielder, playing center field. Hodges also used five pitch ers, but that part of the deploy ment hadn't been planned. It was forced on the Mets when the Expos scored eight runs inside three innings off Gary Gentry and Nolan Ryan. They got two in the first when Ron Hunt walked on four pitches and Staub lined his 15th home run of the season downwind over the right‐field fence. They added one in the second when Bateman drove his 10th of the season deep into the left‐field seats, making it 3‐0. Then in the third Hunt singled to left, Gary Suther land walked on the 3‐and‐2 pitch and Staub—“Le Grand Orange” of Texas — lined triple into the alley in left center. Both runners scored and when Cleon Jones dribbled the rebound, Staub was waved in, too. He swept across the plate redhead‐first, a one‐hand hook slide that beat the tag, and now it was 6‐0. Then Ron Fairly popped a catchable fly into short right field that nobody caught, the ball bouncing off Ken Bos well's glove as he tried an overhead save. Hodges decided it wasn't Gentry's night and sent in Ryan, last seen walking five batters and hitting one in two innings in Philadelphia. This time Ryan got two quick outs before he started his thing. He gave up a scoring single and two walks and socked Hunt on the left fore arm with a fastball, forcing in another run before Ron Taylor rushed in and closed out the inning. For Hunt, the onetime rough house of the Mets, it was an other footnote to his violent life and times as the major leagues' most‐wounded clay pigeon. It was the 42d time this season he had been hit by pitchers. He already holds the modern record for targetry. If he can mage to get hit seven more times, he will tie Hughey Jennings of the 1896 Baltimore Orioles. While all that was going on, Renko was beating his old teammates for the third tim this season. All three times the victim was Gentry. Renko held the Mets to one hit until the seventh, when Ted Martinez tripled and Art Shamsky sin gled. That was the only mo ment of cheer they provided for Mrs. Payson north of the bor der tonight except for a pair of tag‐end runs in the ninth. The medical reports started early: X‐rays showed no liga ment damage on Tommie Agee's right knee. But 20 more cubic centimeters of blood were drained off. Dave Marshall also had X‐rays on his right side, showing a muscle strain, and Don Hahn's X‐rays showed only a sprained left thumb. Also, Boswell's right shoulder was hurting and he left the game after four innings.

1463-> RIFT BREAKS OUT ON STOCK QUOTES
A dispute broke out yester day between the two principal companies that supply, auto mated stock‐market quotations and other computerized servites through the securities industry to the nation's investors. The Bunker‐Ramo Corpora tion stopped supplying, certain over ‐ the ‐ counter quotation services to the Ultronic Sys tems Corporation, charging that Ultronic had allowed wide spread dissemination of the service to unauthorized users. Ultronic retaliated with a petition to the New York State Supreme Court, asking for a preliminary injunction and re straining order to require Bunker‐Ramo to resume the service. Late in the day, the National Associaticin of Securities Deal ers in Washington asked Bunk er‐Ramo to resume the quota tion service, pending a prompt resolution of the dispute. The N.A.S.D. said it was investigat ing the matter. At issue is the Level One service of the National Asso ciation of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations system. Bunker‐Ramo is the operator of the NASDAQ system, which was started in February and which provides automated quotations for over‐the‐counter stocks. Bunker‐Ramo, Ultronic and another company, Scantlin Electronics, sell automated quo tations services to brokerage firms. Only Bunker‐Ramo op erates the NASDAQ system, but it provides NASDAQ quotes to the two other companies. The two others in turn sell the NASDAQ quotation services to brokerage firms. Bunker Ramo charged that Ultronic had failed to charge many of its brokerage‐firm customers for the Level One service, which involves bid and asked prices from market‐makers on some 2,800 issues carried in the NASDAQ system. These quotes are automati cally calculated by Bunker Ramo computers, and are trans mitted instantly to the other distributors who then make the data available to authorized subscribers approved by the N.A.S.D. The other distributors, Ul tronic and Scantlin, are sup posed to charge their subscrib ers for the services, according to Bunker‐Ramo, and then remit specified amounts to Bunker‐Ramo. The company said the N.A.S.D. bylaws stated that subscribers must remit to the NASDAQ operator $20 a month for the first desk‐top device, or terminal, in an office and $10 a month for each subsequent unit in the office for all devices ca pable of receiving Level One data. The quotations ultimately ap pear on desk‐top devices that are operated by brokers. The same devices existed prior to NASDAQ and were then used primarily for issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Ex change. Anthony A. Barnett, vice president and general manager of the NASDAQ service for Bunker‐Ramo, said Ultronic, in effect, had failed to inhibit the Level One service for its sub scribers, causing it to be available automatically to all of them without charge. “The net effect was that they were giving the service away,” he said in a telephone inter view from NASDAQ headquar ters in Trumbull, Conn. He add ed that revenues of about $100,000 a month were being lost because of the failure to charge. He noted that Bunker‐Ramo and Scantlin had lived up to agreements to charge their cus tomers for the service, while Ultronic, by failing to charge, had violated contractual agree ments and had achieved a com petitive advantage. Mr. Barnett said that Bunker Ramo had invested over $25‐ million in the NASDAQ system and that its agreement with the N.A.S.D. permitted it to achieve a minimum rate of re turn on the investment. G.T.E. Information Systems, Inc., parent of Ultronic, issued a statement calling the Bunker Ramo action “arbitrary and un warranted.” It said the sus pension has affected more than 1,000 customers. The statement quoted J. T. Lawson, president of Ultronic, as having said, “Our attorneys advise us that Bunker‐Ramo's action is without justification and we intend to take every available legal means to compel the immediate restoration of service.” Both Ultronic and Bunker Ramo noted that the suspen sion did not affect NASDAQ Level Two and Three sub scribers, who receive more de tailed quotation information, nor did the action involve any of the quotation services for listed securities.

Concerts can be exciting, beautiful, stirring, stimulating and all sorts of other things. But they are not often joyful in the way that the one given by the New England Conservatory at Town Hall Wednesday night was. Performing were the conservatory Tour Chorus led by Lorna Cooke de Varen and the Scholarship Brass Quintet. What created the high spirits was not just the music played, but the high‐spirited rand expert) way these young people launched into everything. The program helped. It was full of nuggets, among them psalms from the Ainsworth Psalter (1612), which is music the Pilgrims sang when they first arrived here. In addition to a generous helping of old music—Janequin, Monteverdi, Gibbons (for the last‐named's “London Street Cries,” the chorus spread through the hall), Pachelbel —there was plenty of new music Ives, Ravel, Schoenberg, Beeson and first New York performances of works by Malcolm Peyton and Daniel Pinkham. The crown of the evening was a stunning, robust, athletic, scintillating performance of Alvin Etler's Brass Quintet.

1467-> Books of The Times
If any romance, any gallantry Still clings to the pathetic and turbulent relationship between Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Essex, Robert Lacey's book will siphon it off. It is a sec, cold‐eyed, underplayed pitiless assessment of an aging, imperious woman playing a fanciful game that sud denly gets out of hand and of a man in dangerous waters and clearly out of his depth. No one was more in error in judging his own worth than Essex, and no one ?? more dearly for the mistake. Technically his death sentence was due to the revolt he thought he was heading in the winter of 1601. But, as Mr. Lacey tells it, it was such a Mack Sennett affair, so ludicrous in what it professed, so creaky and inadequate in operation, that a juster sentence would have been to dress up the man in motley and set him in the stocks. The ignominy of a custard pie in the eye would have achieved more in bringing the man to his senses than the separation of his head from his body. But I suppose armed insurrection to the Elizabethans was no laughing affair. The excesses of the War of the Roses were still warm in the memory of the Queen and her council. After all, it was Henry Tudor, Elizabeth's grandfather, who finally brought a little quiet to the kingdom and that was not such a long time ago. That she was fond of the tall, russet haired courtier, some 34 years younger than she, there can be no doubt, though love as we understand the word was the last term that could be applied to their intimacy. The Queen liked to be made much of, for reasons of state to begin with, for personal reasons later on. To have such an attractive gallant pay hom age to her, to have him whisper in her ear, to flirt and dance, must have done much for her ego. In her own way she paid for the privilege, for Essex presumed on her friendship. Without permission, he left the court to join the fighting in Portugal. His marriage to Frances Walsingham, the widow of Philip Sidney, didn't go down too well with his royal friend, and his amorous bouts with the ladies of the court must have brought a sour strain into their friendship. And Essex had an arrogant habit of knight ing people after a battle with casual abandon—a practice that set Elizabeth's teeth on edge. One time, as we know, she boxed his ears and he in fury put his hand on the hilt of his sword. These antics, though, did not seem to mar their friendship. If it was strong enough to withstand such challenges, how then did it get out of hand? It is the author's thesis that there was no real feel ing on either side, that the cement that bound them was economic in character. Essex had been impoverished by his father and he came to court in great measure to re‐establish his fortune. He could have done it. But a number of things worked against him. He was willful and extravagant and no great manager of his own affairs. In addition, says Mr. Lacey, an English editor and historian, the Queen never wanted him to be free of debt. Had he remained in her good graces, the rights and perquisites would surely have con tinued throughout her life. But she did not want him independent. He was bound to her not by love but by need. From the evidence, the real threat to their friendship was that Essex was an ambitious dope — arrogant and incom petent. Stupidity and power make up a dangerous mixture, usually for others, sometimes for those who possess them. Essex was just not bright. His contempo raries at the court were as avaricious as he and looked after their own interests as well as public ones. But they were, at their best, good administrators, able servants, men of skill and purpose. Essex had all the trapping but none of the substance. No one looked more like a Renaissance man and was less so than this favorite of the Queen. His military activities, in spite of the money and energy he poured into them, were marked by woeful staff work and ari emphasis on form. His last campaign in Ireland, in a guerrilla‐type operation. showed that he had not the slightest idea. Though he aspired to the post of diplomat, he had none of the qualities necessary to be a good one. He was un stable, volatile, quick to anger, governed by spleen, not brain, and subject to melan choly fits that paralyzed all bodily actions. He believed he could redeem any miscal culation, unsupported charge or wild sur mise by resorting to the sword. All this must have been known to the Queen. Why then did she give him offices and commissions, bringing misery to her and himself to the block? That is a good question. The author prefers to think the Essex was a man of the future because he chal lenged the absolutism of Elizabeth. But he seems more like one of those touchy, head strong and brutal clods who kept killing each other during the Lancastrian and Yorkish wars. He was a lot closer to the Percies than to Robert Walpole. Mr. Lacey blames the Earl's deficiencies on his family background and his later instability on a dose of syphilis. Both reasons seem super fluous to me. Essex was just a fool—not the first man of whom more was de manded than could be delivered. The author's tone is cold his attitude not far from mocking. He has a habit of anticipating results, so that we are aware of the results before we encounter the incidents that produced them. All the drama and excitement are anticipated and defused. Thus everything about the book is peculiarly cold. The romantic approach may be out. But is the clinical one for such a subject enough?

George Lois and his fellow officers also want to see the club with its almost 600‐ members become a political force in the city with the city coming to it for advice on design and communica tions. “We'll do it for nothing,” said Mr. Lois, “and the club will gain prestige because people will look at it and say, ‘They care.’ “ For years, he noted, the club has been important in people's minds only because of the prestigious awards they presented annually. But, he asks, “Is the club going to exist for a dinner? Is that what a club is all about?” Maybe because he is one, Mr. Lois feels very special about art directors. “As a group,” he said they care more than copywriters — they're more socially aware.” Is that true? The first blizzard of the season is always made up of news releases from the wine and liquor boys eager to announce their holiday promotion plans. And from the nearest drift, this nugget contributed by 21 Brands for its Ballantine's Scotch, is easily the bright est of the lot: “It is a total marketing effort orchest rated to penetrate the con sumer consciousnes with the same via a variety of instru mentalities.” Now that's quite a challenge for Cun ningham & Walsh to live up to. “Large” and “most” are favorite words at this time of the year and Barton's Brands, with McCann‐Erick son is promising the “most intensive advertising promo tional program for a single brand.” That brand is Bar ton's QT. It will get an extra $2.5‐million in advertising in one 60‐day period. “One of the largest tele vision blitzes ever prepared on behalf of an imported wine,” is what Bas Charring ton Vintners (U.S.A.) and Compton are planning for Alexis Lichine French wines. There's $1‐million going into TV in the 12 top markets and a print backup. The message for the folks, “Lichine wines can easily complement their drinking habits.” “The most ‘splendiferous’ holiday‐season merchandis ing support program,” is what Schenley is publicizing to its distributor principals and sales force in meetings going on this month in 10 cities. But far from being paro chial, Schenley, or at least its Howard S. Feldman, is of fering some Industry‐wide predictions — fourth‐quarter sales up nearly 4 per cent to $3.86‐billion. Can Alka‐Seltzer sales in creases be far behind? “The most dramatic holi day treatment ever” is what Buckingham Corporation's Cutty Sark Scotch is getting through Clyne Maxon. It's been accomplished by using a photograph of the famous Cutty Sark clipper ship with her rigging ablaze with lights. Sort of a three‐masted Christmas tree. Spring Theme* While the liquor crowd is looking forward to Christ mas, the soft goods gang, obviously folk with greater vision, have their eyes on next spring. The Blue Bell boys also, apparently, have their eyes on the economy, because for their Wrangler jeans and sportswear for lads and lassies they're using the theme, “Wrangler thinks Americans spend too much for clothes … And Wrangler is doing something about it.” Besides a national print ef fort, Altman Stoller, the agency, will have the youth oriented products promoted with 7,500 spots on 300 radio stations in February and March.

1469-> Books of The Times
“There is something very special about these northern voyages,” Samuel Eliot Morison casually remarks at the start of his account of the earliest explorations of the treacherous North Atlantic, where “anything might happen to you.” And he's made a very special book about them. We're moved, to begin with, by its existence: a 700‐page narrative from an 83‐year‐old historian who announces that it is the first, “God willing,” of a three ‐ volume study. If it were feeble, who would say so? We could just compose valentines about his distinguished career instead of reviewing the look at hand. But no such polite sidestepping gavottes will be needed. “The European Discovery of America” is splendid: It is wittily, vigorously written, shrewd and decisive in judgment, unfailingly enjoyable. The southern voyages that will be coyered in Admiral Morison's second volume—Columbus, Cortez and the rest—are a more familiar, heroic success‐story, with a builtin imperial theme. These ventures across the uninviting northern ocean are more obscure, the records of them more fragmentary. They have always seemed brave but distinctly unthrilling failures. Leif Ericson (well, maybe), John Cabot, Verrazano, Cartier, Frobisher and John Davis —did they ever fire your imagination in school? None of them found the Northwest Passage; they didn't even bring home any gold. Here they suddenly come to life. Admiral Morison's search for information about them, his piecing together of wisps and fragments, becomes an adventure. There's a wonderful chapter, early on, about the sixth‐century voyage of the Irish monk St. Brendan. It seems as dreamlike as the Owl and Pussycat's excursion until Admiral Morison applies to it his own experience of small‐boat navigation in the Atlantic and tests the story for its elements of plausible historical possibility. He sifts the Norse sagas in the same way, locating Vinland in Newfoundland—with a snort at the “scores of books and articles by assorted oddballs” on “Viking remains” in New England: “If you imagine that common sense will rule the approach to any of these problems, you are very wrong … there will always be people who believe that the Vikings tramped all over North America, shedding implements, battle‐axes and runic inscriptions.” Investigation of the dim past is continually freshened by firsthand observation. Admiral Morison pays tribute to a friend in whose Beechcraft he flew over unphotographed coasts, to a Maine fisherman who taught him navigation through fog without a compass. I particularly like his interview with an aristocratic lady in the Azores, who set him straight about the, social rank of the Azorean voyager of 1500 after whom Labrador is named: Whatever he may have achieved elsewhere, she sternly told him, in his home town the fellow was “a nobody—no one ever heard of him!” The great 15th and 16th‐century British voyages are prefaced by a discussion of life aboard the small ships. What did sailors wear? How well were they fed? (Very heartily indeed, on Frobisher's 1577 trip: a pound of biscuit and a pound of beef a man per diem, with a gallon of beer, a quarter‐pound of butter and half a pound of cheese!) We are taught to look at the drawings of ships on old maps as more than decoration: They can be read. The mumbo‐jumbo of a Lowland Scots chantey yields information on how a ship got under way. If you're a reader who skips footnotes, you will have to change your ways. Some of the book's most entertaining passages are in small type at the ends of chapters—such as the definition of “codex” as “a European manuscript sold to an American for a sum written in five or six figures,” the amiable putting‐down of hoaxes (Admiral Morison believes Yale's Vinland map to be one of these), and the sterner cuffing of a few scholars who arouse his ire. Meanwhile, an episodic record of apparent defeats is gradually revealing its epic shape. John Cabot, lost at sea, nobody knows where, after having given England her claim to America. Verrazano sailing to New York harbor and turning away without discovering Manhattan; then eaten by cannibals in the Caribbean while his brother looked helplessly on. Sir Humfry Gilbert lost too, reading Sir Thomas More's “Utopia” at the end. Finally, Gov. John White arriving at Roanoke Island on an August night in 1590, to find the Virginia colonists, totally vanished. “We let fall our Grapnel neere the shore,” he sadly recorded, “& sounded with a trumpet a Call, & afterwardes‐many familiar English tunes of Songs, and called to them friendly; but we had no answere.” With this moment of profound stillness, Admiral Morison's book ends. As the 17th century opened, there was not a colonist in northern America. A thousand years of northern voyages had failed. “What a contrast to the wonders the Spanish had accomplished in the West Indies, Mexico, Peru and New Granada!” Within a decade, with the founding of Jamestown in 1607, thet ide will suddenly shift. Admiral Morison has brought our shadowy prehistory into the light, and the fresh perspective is breathtaking

1470-> The World
“There's been nothing like this since the announcement of the Soviet German nonaggression pact in August, 1939,” said a veteran diplomat last week. He was talking of President Nixon's plan to go to Communist China. And the comparison seemed justified—if only by the extent to which it pro duced a crazy mix‐up of former friends and foes. “Rarely, I think, has the action of any President so captured the imagi nation of the American people as President Nixon's magnificent gesture last week,” said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who could yet be the Demo crats' choice to oppose the President's bid for re‐election next year. The visit could lead to the “great trilogy of betrayal” following Munich and Yalta, said Robert Morris, former counsel to the Senate Internal Se curity subcommittee and one of the anti‐Communist hard liners who once regarded Richard Nixon as their stand ard bearer. In Europe and Asia, too, there were abundant signs of confusion, incre dulity and questioning of some funda mental assumptions. Two equally loyal Soviet satellites—Poland and Bul garia—split publicly in their evalua tion of the news. Warsaw said “the only possible reaction is to welcome Nixon's decision,” while Sofia saw in that same decision only evidence of Peking's “secret collusion with im perialism.” Pravda last night indicated the Kremlin was taking an intermediate position for the moment. For the first week after the Nixon announcement, both North Vietnam and North Korea — clearly troubled about Peking's motives — simply hid from their people the news of the invitation to the President to visit China. Simultaneously in Taiwan and Japan there were signs of similar ap prehension about Mr. Nixon's motives. “Overnight every assumption about the shape of the international situa tion and its probable development has been called into question everywhere,” one diplomat commented. “Whole libraries of position papers and con tingency plans have been made worth less. Now everybody's trying to figure out what's going on and what his country should be doing differently today in order to be safe six months or a year from now when all the im plications are out in the open.” In this strange situation, the follow ing questions dominated the discussion: While reportedly jubilant over the mainly enthusiastic domestic reaction he had aroused, President Nixon kept out of the limelight last week. He briefed Congressional leaders on his planned trip, but he left it to Secretary of State William P. Rogers to explain his purposes to foreign diplomats. If there was a Claw In the Presi dent's satisfaction, it was the fear that he might have aroused unrealistic ex pectations that could backfire. But his effort to dampen speculation on what his trip might produce only succeeded in sharpening anxieties in some quar ters as to whether the whole venture had been thought through adequately in advance. Former Under Secretary of State George W. Ball, for example, criticized Mr. Nixon's “flamboyant diplomacy” and warned of risks ahead. Yet the record shows that Ricnard Nixon for some time has favored re knitting this country's ties with China. In October, 1967, more than a year before his election, he wrote: “Taking the long view, we simply cannot af ford to leave China forever outside the family of nations, there to nurture its fantasies, cherish its hates and threaten its neighbors. There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its poten tially most able people to live in angry isolation.” The immediate pressures for Mr. Nixon's dramatic step, however, seemed two‐fold. One was the relative weak ening of American power on the world scene. The other was the war‐weary mood of the American people as the 1972 Presidential election approached. As for the world scene, there was a time when the United States could deal with the Soviet Union—such as in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis—from a position of strength born of abso lute nuclear superiority. Today Mos cow enjoys effective nuclear parity with the United States. In the current configuration of world power, China is the obvious choice as the nation, with which the United States should try to improve relations to offset growing Soviet power. As for the domestic scene, Mr. Nixon has made plain that he hopes to run for re‐election next year as a “peace candidate,” as the “man who brought the boys home from Vietnam.” He can hardly have forgotten the campaign impact of General Eisenhower's decla ration in 1952 that “I will go to Korea,” implying he would end the Korean War. Now Mr. Nixon has told the na tion in effect, “I will go to Peking,” a message implying that he may thereby find a way to end the Vietnam war. At the very least, therefore, his China gambit seems to have won him more time in Vietnam. The critics who two weeks ago were badgering the President with demands that he re spond positively to Hanoi's seven point peace plan unveiled in Paris have been momentarily engulfed by the groundswell of approval for Mr. Nixon's decision to go to Peking. The basic answer is simple: fear of the Soviet Union. Peking's foreign policy now is aimed at gaining friends and reducing the possibility of a Soviet attack, either an invasion on the Czechoslovak model of 1968 or a Soviet pre‐emptive strike aimed at eliminating China's nuclear capability. Mr. Mao considers the Soviet leaders “world storm troopers,” as the Chinese press called them last month, who aim to impose the Brezhnev Doctrine on the Chinese People's Republic. That doctrine holds, in effect, that the Soviet Union has the right to intervene militarily in any country where, in Moscow's opinion, true Communism is being dismantled. Soviet spokesmen long ago convicted the Mao regime of just such a dis mantling operation. To set the stage for Moscow's ultimate objective, Mr. Mao believes, the Kremlin is now seeking to free its hands on other fronts by reaching settlements with the United States— as in the strategic arms limitation talks—and with Western Europe. By receiving President Nixon and perhaps even normalizing relations with the United States, the Chinese pose a potential threat to Moscow of an eventual Washington‐Peking military alliance. But even short of that distant possibility, the Kissinger‐Chou talks have already warned Moscow it cannot act on the assumption that China is isolated and without powerful friends. A stronger position vis‐à‐vis Moscow is the minimum gain Mr. Mao expects from President Nixon's Peking visit. Mr. Mao's maximum hopes probably encompass a large range of issues. Fully aware of the strong pressures in the United States for peace in Vietnam and a reduction of overseas commitments, the Chinese leaders may hope to persuade President Nixon to withdraw American troops not only from Indochina but possibly also from Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, thus altering the balance of military power throughout East and Southeast Asia. Moreover, by consenting to the Nixon visit, Peking knew it would build powerful momentum for the United Nations Security Council seat it wants. And improved relations with the United States hold out for Peking the prospect of access to both the capital and the technical know‐how the United States possesses and China badly needs. This question produced the sharpest debate of all last week. Much of the favorable domestic reaction to the Nixon visit clearly stemmed from the hope that it would help end the Indo china bloodletting, or at least United States participation therein. In Washington, some experts argued that after more than 25 years of struggle and war the Vietnamese Communists won't let themselves be “sold out” by any big power, and that the Chinese really have no alternative but to support the Vietcong's seven points in Paris. But in Paris, Saigon's spokesman at the peace talks, Nguyen Trieu Dan, claimed that without large Chinese deliveries of military and other supplies, Hanoi could not continue the war at present levels. Peking obviously has a means of putting pressure on Hanoi, and Paris observers noted with interest last week that a high level Chinese delegation is scheduled soon to visit that city. The question being asked: Will the Chinese delegation look over the shoulders of the Hanoi and Vietcong representatives to the peace talks? There seemed little doubt last week that Hanoi feared that the Nixon trip signaled a Washington‐Peking agree ment to impose a Vietnam settlement. Hanoi's official party newspaper, Nhan Dan, warned against any “compromise between the big powers in an attempt to make smaller countries bow to their arrangements.” It said President Nixon “has been running about wildly in search of a way out. But he has gone to the wrong place.” Chou En‐lai, for his part, seemed to be trying to reassure Hanoi last week that Peking will not sacrifice North Vietnam's interests for rap prochement with the United States. He told a group of Americans in Peking that the American people's demand for withdrawal of their troops from Indochina “is even stronger than the demand to restore the relations between the Chinese and the American peoples.” Still, it is hard to believe that Vietnam did not occupy much of the 20 hours Henry Kissinger spoke with Chou En‐lai, or that it will not be a prime matter on the agenda of Mao‐Nixon talks. The Chinese have already sent out signals suggesting they would back a new Geneva con ference on Indochina and support the idea of a neutralized South Vietnam. Meanwhile, American troops continued to leave Vietnam at a rate of several thousand a week, and combat in South Vietnam has diminished to the point where American deaths there this month seem likely to be the lowest in any month since 1965. In light of all that, simple logic suggests that Mr. Kissinger probably at least sounded out Premier Chou on whether the Chinese might help the United States make a graceful exit from Vietnam. One did not have to be a card holding Kremlinologist to discern last week that Moscow was unhappy—to put it conservatively—about the new turn in Sino‐American relations. Soviet officials expressed to Americans in Moscow their suspicions about Wash ington's motives. The attitude toward the Chinese was even harsher. New Times, the Soviet Foreign Ministry's semi‐official maga zine, charged last week that “as soon as they see a chance for an accom modation with imperialism that could be profitable to the national interest of China, the Chinese leaders do an about‐face. They forget their duty to the national liberation movement.” The implication was clear: Peking had sold out the Vietnamese Communists to curry Mr. Nixon's favor. Red Star, the Soviet Defense Ministry organ, said Russian‐language textbooks in China have been revised to delete the words “peace and friendship,” while Chinese studying Russian are obliged to chant the following commands in that lan guage: “Stop. Lay down your arms. Surrender. You will remain alive.” Last night, Pravda's statement greeted a Sino‐American rapprochement, but warned against Sino‐American anti Soviet collaboration. Moscow's wor ries were plain enough. In the short run, better relations with Washington relieves Peking of fear of a conflict with the United States and thus strengthens its ability to defy the Russians' demand that it cease preaching Mr. Mao's heretical brand of Communism and anti‐Soviet propaganda. That is not a turn of affairs the Soviet leaders would welcome. The long‐run implications are even more unpleasant for Moscow. Good Sino‐American relations could mean the infusion of large amounts of American capital and technological capability into the Chinese economy. The result could be a China powerful enough to become a serious military threat to the Soviet Union. Yet Moscow kept its cool at the top level last week. Soviet propaganda organs began the official attack on the Sino‐American rapprochement in a low key. Izvestia published a letter from Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko to United Nations Secretary Thant re iterating Moscow's support for Peking's admission to the United Nations. And Soviet negotiations with the United States (the missile talks in Helsinki) and with the Western allies (on the future of Berlin) continued as though nothing had happened. But behind the scenes a review of Soviet foreign policy options undoubt edly was taking place. There were, after all, potential ways for Moscow to try to undermine any incipient Washington‐Peking axis by an appeal ing offer to one—or even both—of the two sides. Moreover, there were world trouble spots — Vietnam, the Middle East, Berlin—where Soviet pressure could remind the partners in the Nixon‐Mao dialogue that any attempt to conspire against the Soviet Union might be fraught with serious conse quences. “We shall not be flustered,” Jap anese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato told reporters the day he heard about the proposed Nixon visit to Peking. But last week, reacting to a storm of criticism charging that Washington had scored a jump on Japan, the Premier declared he was ready to go to Peking “whenever I decide condi tions permit.” And he made no secret of his bitterness over not having been consulted in advance about the Kissinger mission and its goal, saying: “We are ready to keep a secret. There should have been full consultations in advance.” The planned Nixon trip to China hit Japan especially hard because Japan—among all the world's major nations—is perhaps most preoccupied with the China “problem.” China is not only Japan's near and massive neighbor but also the source of much of Japanese culture and a potent, recurrent factor in Japan's history and destiny. If Premier Sato felt betrayed, it was because he and his followers had long supported a pro American policy against domestic opponents who wanted a pro‐Chinese policy. Japanese businessmen with large investments in Taiwan wondered what the future of their factories there would be if Taiwan—as they suspected —soon comes under Peking rule. Other Japanese businessmen last week began to abandon contacts that might displease the Chinese Communists. Major Japanese companies canceled scheduled economic conferences with Chinese Nationalist and South Korean representatives, and five of six Japanese shipping companies serving Taiwan announced withdrawal from that route. The general impression was that many Japanese — businessmen and politicians alike—had concluded that Peking was going to be the dominant power in Asia and were already preparing for that eventuality. Thirty college students carrying banners accusing President Nixon of preparing to “sell out” Taiwan dem onstrated in front of the United States Embassy in Taipei last Monday. Since the Nationalist Government could have mobilized thousands of demonstrators, the minuscule, symbolic group testified to how cautiously President Chiang Kai‐shek was weighing his choices. Nevertheless, there were clear signs of official anger and bitterness. Thus Premier C. K. Yen declared that if Washington was increasing its con tacts with the Chinese Communists in order to change their “hostile and aggressive ambitions,” it was “har boring unrealistic illusions, helping inflame the regime's maliciousness and increasing the danger of subver sion and attack upon the democratic nations.” The English‐language China Post called the proposed Nixon trip “an incredible folly,” compared Mr. Nixon's statement to Neville Chamberlain's at Munich. To the gloomy rulers in Taipei it came as no surprise last week that the Senate Foreign Relations Commit tee in Washington voted unanimously to repeal the 1955 Congressional reso lution authorizing employment of American military forces to defend Taiwan. To counter Taiwan's fears, it became known last week, President Nixon had sent a personal message to Generalissimo Chiang assuring him this country would honor its treaty obligations to defend Taiwan. The most pressing policy question for Generalissimo Chiang and his as sociates concerned the United Nations. They could see the storm signals in dicating that Peking might be voted into full United Nations membership this fall. For the Generalissimo the issue seemed to be coming down to whether to abandon the United Na tions voluntarily or fight to retain a General Assembly seat, thus accepting the two‐Chinas policy that both he and Mr. Mao repeatedly have rejected. So unhappy were the leaders on Taiwan, there was speculation they might even sound out Moscow for support. If the Taiwan leaders refuse to accept dual Chinese representation, a Peking victory is inevitable and Washington can argue that Taipei's inflexibility was to blame. But if they, accept the idea of dual representation, they still run the risk that the Gen eral Assembly will vote that Peking is the only legitimate representative of China—particularly if the United Slates, as Taipei has begun to fear, fails to make a vigorous fight for the two‐Chinas position. • As the arguments and maneuvering set off by the historic move toward Sino ‐ American rapprochement con tinue, it is plain that both sides have made substantial wagers on the out come, and that both have already reg istered significant gains and losses from the mere announcement of the invitation. Only time will tell whether President Nixon had scored his great est political triumph or has marched into the most difficult crisis of his life.

1472-> For Rogers, No Golf, but an Endless Round of Talks
Secretary of State William P. Rogers, a man who thrives on frantic activity and excels at quiet persuasion, has been devoting himself to both pursuits virtually around the clock since he set up field headquarters in New York last Thursday to direct major American diplomatic campaigns. The ostensible reason for the presence of Mr. Rogers here is the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly, which traditionally brings scores of foreign ministers to the building on the East River to engage in speech‐making and, for the most part, casual diplomacy. But to a greater extent this year than in the past, the General Assembly session serves as an opportunity for Secretary Rogers to conduct diplomatic business involving American interests in every part of the globe. When he went to bed Friday night at the end of 16‐hour day, which included 11 ministerial conferences, a working lunch in the grill of the Waldorf‐Astoria Hotel, a black‐tie dinner at the United Nations and the drafting of his Assembly speech for today, Bill Rogers was too hoarse to say goodnight to his advisers. But on Saturday he was up before 9 A.M., (though he thought it was 8) and put in an hour's work in his personal apartment on the 19th floor of a building on United Nations Plaza before strolling across First Avenue for a three‐hour session with Australian and New Zealand Cabinet ministers at the United States Mission to the United Nations. At the apartment, he received his daily intelligence briefing—based on material prepared overnight by the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research and the Central Intelligence Agency—and read a summary of the most important telegrams received during the night from embassies abroad. As Mrs. Rogers brought in coffee, the Secretary and his closest advisers again went over the draft of his General Assembly speech. He made several suggestions—add this section, delete that — and found time for a telephone conversation with U. Alexis Johnson, the Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, who is minding the store in Washington. He held an impromptu news confegence in the lobby of the United States Mission building, then jumped into his limousine and headed for his temporary office in Suite 35‐A of the Waldorf Towers. This suite, guarded by Marine Corps corporal and State Department security men, has been — and for the next eight days will continue to be — the scene of Mr. Rogers's conferences with the visiting foreign ministers. However, a lunch for the French Foreign Minister, Maurice. Schumann, and a dinner for the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, were held in Suite 45‐A of the Waldorf Towers, 10 floors higher. This more spacious apartment is the home of George Bush, the Connecticut Yankee transplanted to Texas who since March has been chief American delegate to the United Nations. The lunch and dinner were held on Sept. 24, the day that Mr. Rogers's frantic diplomatic peace actually began. The General Assembly session had opened three days earlier. After attending a Cabinet meeting at the White House, Mr. Rogers flew aboard an Air Force jet transport from Andrews Air Force Base, near Washington, to La Guardia Airport here. As soon as he reached the Waldorf‐Astoria, he was ready to receive in Suite 35‐A the Foreign Ministers of Norway, Iceland, Turkey and Iran and the chief Japanese delegate to the United Nations. On the 25th, a Saturday, Mr. Rogers visited the UnitNations Secretary General, U Thant, and discussed the Middle East dispute with him and with Dr. Gunnar V. Jarring, the Swedish diplomat who has been mediating it. He also called on the General Assembly's new president, Adam Malik of Indonesia, held a news conference in the lobby of the United Nations building, and flew to join President Nixon in greeting Japan's Emperor Hirohito. Secretary Rogers was back in Washington from Alaska last Monday night. He spent Tuesday, Wednesday and part of Thursday in the capital, sitting in on Mr. Nixon's conferences with Mr. Gromyko and Sir Alec DouglasHome, the British Foreign Secretary. On Thursday Mr. Rogers lunched with Mr. Gromyko and signed with him agreements on the prevention of nuclear accidents and the establishment of a satellite hot line between Washington and Moscow. For good measure he talked with the Peruvian Foreign Minister, Edgardo Mercado Jarrin, and with Egypt's Foreign Minister, Mahmoud Riad, and held a background briefing for newsmen before hurrying to Andrews to catch his jet for New York. During his marathon day last Friday, Mr. Rogers saw the Foreign Ministers of Tunisia, Sudan, Britain (for the second time that week), Sweden, the Congo (Kinshasa), the Netherlands, Venezuela, India, Canada, Bahrain and West Germany. The procession of foreign dignitaries started at 9:30 A.M. and ended after 7 P.M. with intervals of less than five minutes between them and with only a quick lunch break downstairs. He ate a minute steak. A meeting with his advisers followed the exit of the West German minister, and Secretary Rogers barely had time to get into his dinner jacket for Mr. Thant's banquet for 250 guests. He sat next to the Hungarian Foreign Minister, a reticent man, and listened intently to the dinner toasts, which often carry diplomatic double‐entendres. Mr. Rogers hoped to see a half‐dozen ministers after his Assembly speech this morning, including Israel's Abba Eban, to pursue his two‐year effort at Middle Eastern peacemaking. He will remain in New York for nine or 10 more days, seeing ministers, listening to their problems and trying to explain American policies and plans to them. These talks are not simply diplomatic niceties. The meetings involve sensitive negotiations related to the two principal American diplomatic campaigns this fall —one to win a temporary settlement in the Middle East and the other to prevent Nationalist China's expulsion from the United Nations—as well as a large number of other world issues, such as disarmament and United States problems with dozens of countries. Secretary Rogers's talents in the field of quiet persuasion and tactful arm‐twisting —he is, after all, a corporate lawyer and a former Attorney General of the United States —are especially required in the complex Middle Eastern talks and in the battle over Chinese representation in the United Nations. But, in his present job, he needs an encyclopedic knowledge of virtually every international problem. Last week alone he was required to explain President Nixon's new economic policies to a score of anxious foreign ministers; tell the Canadians why the United States may wish to explode underground nuclear devices in the Aleutians this month; dicker with the Russians, the French and the British over the selection of a new United Nations Secretary General (Mr. Thant is retiring this year); urge the Indians not to aggravate their dispute with Pakistan; listen to a Sudanese request for more diplomats in Washington and to a Venezuelan inquiry about surveying the country's river systems; press the West Germans for an agreement to offset the costs of stationing American troops on their territory; argue about textile imports with the Japanese; and hear from the British about their problems with Soviet Mr. Rogers also had to take a position for the United States on a European security conference proposed by the Soviet Union (Washington is not in a hurry), explain to the Swedes why the United States thinks that the Vietnam peace talks in Paris are stalled, and tell the new state of Bahrain that Washington is watching keenly Soviet moves in the Persian Gulf. To cope with these problems, Mr. Rogers, of course, draws on his nearly three years of experience as Secretary of State. But, every morning, he must also go through two sets of briefing books — one for the morning and one for the afternoon sessions — so that he can anticipate questions and be ready with the answers. If there is a short break between conferences, he may quickly peek into the pertinent briefing book. Many of the ministers are old friends or acquaintances from previous visits and conferences, and this makes matters somewhat easier on occasion. Not so, however, with Mr. Gromyko, a tough and careful bargainer. When Mr. Rogers remarked jokingly to the Russian the other day that he was the oldest foreign minister in the world in length of service — nearly 20 years — Mr. Gromyko re plied dryly, “I haven't analyzed this problem.” Yesterday, as he spent his Sunday putting finishing touches on his speech, Secretary Rogers remarked wistfully, “It sure would be nice to be out with a golf club.” But, just then, the telephone in the apartment rang and one of his aides said, “Mr. Secretary, the President wishes to speak to you.”

1474-> U.S. Jets Attack in the North For the 77th Time This Year
SAIGON, South Vietnam, Thursday, Nov. 18 (AP)—Four American supersonic fighter bombers destroyed one antiair craft artillery gun and damaged another yesterday in the 77th raid inside North Vietnam this year, the United States com mand said today. A communiqué said the at tack was carried out at the Ban karai pass, 40 miles north of the demilitarized zone, near the Laotian border, after North Vietnamese guns opened fire on the United States jets. “There was no damage to the U.S. aircraft,” the communiqué said. The command said the F‐4 Phantom jets were on a bomb ing mission against the Ho Chi Minh trail supply network in eastern Laos when they were fired at, and were diverted to bomb the gun sites. No American ground action was reported.

1475-> A Druse Leader in Israel Named a Deputy Minister
JERUSALEM, Oct. 3 (AP)—The Israeli Government has appointed a Druse leader, Sheik Jaber Muadi, as Deputy Minister of Communications, making him one of two Arabs to have achieved deputy ministerial status in Israel. The other Arab is Abdel Aziz Zuabi, a Nazareth Moslem appointed Deputy Health Minister in May. The Druses—there are about 36,000 in Israel—are a group that broke from Islam in the 11th century and are strongly anti‐Moslem despite their Arab background. The Druse Union of Israel, a group of intellectuals, has accused the Israeli Government of expropriating Druse farmland, denying the Druses sufficient funds for village development and paying them less for their harvests than Jewish farmers receive. Israelis regard the Druses as loyal to Israel, partly because they have been persecuted by Arab governments. They are the only non‐Jews in Israel permitted to serve in the army.

1476-> Health of Nation Lags Behind Scientific Gains.
WASHINGTON, July 15 American medical science has made spectacular advances in the last quarter‐century, but improvements in the over‐all American death rate and the infant and maternal mortality rates have leveled off and the United States still lags behind many other nations. This phenomenon, along with rising medical costs and bottle necks in the delivery of health care, are key factors in a grow ing national debate that is like ly to spill over into the 1372 political campaign and is enus ing pressure for health care reforms. It is prompting new interest in such questions as: How healthy are Americans? And how good is the care they receive? This interest was demon strated today with the issuance health problems by the Na tional Health Education Com mittee, which brought together many of the findings of the public health authorities in government and private agen cies. Like other analyses, this re port showed there were no easy answers to the question of health care. Despite all the scientific ad vances, the country is in the grip of at least two vast epi demics — venereal disease, which in its most widespread form, gonorrhea, has doubled frequency in the last six years, and heart disease, which is the nation's No. 1 cause of death. However, medical science has made tremendous strides in transplanting hearts, in curing polio and curbing infectious dis ease with antibiotics. The truth is, no one really wants health care at all; what everyone wants is health. But in the United States, health is a mosaic of contrasts and con tradictions. Obesity rubs elbows with malnutrition. Many old kil lers have been vanquished, but sonic remain and others have come forward. Moreover, In American so ciety a person's state of health and chances of getting good medical care depend a lot on who he is, how much money he has and where he lives. This has always been true, but today the best of care can do so much that it makes the worst seem doubly hard. The middle‐aged man who has his heart attack near a hos pital equipped with a special coronary care unit has a much better chance of survival than the man whose hospital lacks one. The young person with early Hodgkin's disease has a good chance of cure or control of that usually fatal illness—if he goes to one of a handful of major cancer centers that most patients never reach. The kidney patient whose fainily—or community—can af ford the huge expense of the artificial kidney machine may live. The patient without such resources will probably die. Several Americans have lived for more than a year with transplanted hearts. Several thousand have had kidney transplants. Yet between 100 and 200 persons each year die of tetanus, an infection that should be totally preventable by inoculations that have been available for decades. Statistically, American chil dren are among the largest in the world and probably among the healthiest. But a few of them have kwashiorkor, a form of infant malnutrition so severe that it is often fatal. The cause is simple lack of good protein food. The underlying cause is almost always poverty. Indeed, throughout American life, the problems of poverty and ill health tend to be closely linked. Often, too, they are compounded by geography. Some of the most acute health problems are in rural areas where isolated communi ties simply have no care at all. To Government bureaucrats this is a “failure of the delivery of health care.” To the sick person far from the nearest doctor or hospital it may mean a minor illness made grave through neglect. It May mean death. Throughout the United States there are 134 counties, with a total population of near ly 500,000, that have no doc tors at all in private practice. In general, Americans are lalmost certainly healthier and far less prey to disease than they were a few decades ago. The dread infections that used to rage through whole com munities are muted. Diphtheria, typhoid fever, paralytic polio, whooping cough, undulant fe ver and rheumatic fever are no longer among the common risks of life. Their retreat has been rapid since the advent of anti biotics and new vaccines after World War II. Death and dis ease rates from tuberculosis have been declining steadily for more than 50 years. But tuberculosis has not vanished, nor have the others. There are nearly 40,000 cases of tuberculosis a year, most of them among the poor, the down‐and‐out. Paralytic polio and diphtheria still occur in small outbreaks that seem all the more tragic because they need not have occurred. The chief cause is lack of immuniza tion; and the chief cause of that, again, is poverty. The nation's infant mortality rate has dropped from about 65 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1930 to less than a third of that toll today. Maternal death rates and over‐all death rates have also declined steadily during most of the last 40 years. But in those indexes of health the United States is behind many of the other highly de veloped nations. At least dozen countries have lower in fant mortality rates than this, according to figures from the National Center for Health Statistics. The rate at which American mothers die in child birth exceeds that of 100 other countries and the women of six other countries live longer than their American sisters. There has been a lot of debate over the worth of this kind of score keeping. Some critics say true comparisons are impossible because of dif ferences between populations and methods of record keeping. Other public health specialists doubt that these factors ac count entirely for the poor showing of the United States. The differences are particu larly striking when infant mor tality rates are compared. For many decades these rates de dined steadily in virtually all of the world's economically advanced countries. Then, about mid‐century, the prog ress slowed and there was a general leveling off. A compa rative study done by the Na tional Center for Health Statis tics showed that this unfavor able new trend started five years earlier in the United States than in six countries of Northern Europe—England and Wales, the Netherlands, Scot land, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. No one knows why. In general our rates were less favorable than theirs before the leveling off and we still lag behind them. Some experts think it more useful to consider trends in the United States over time than to compare this country with others. This exercise is not entirely reassuring either. In 1949 the average 35‐year‐ old American could look for ward to 37.3 more years of life. During the two decades of med ical miracles that followed, the outlook for the 35‐year‐old age group improved only little more than a year. That improvement was less than it was between the years 1900 and 1919—before anti biotics, sulfa drugs, heart sur gery and intensive care units in hospitals. There were im provements in health care dur mg those first two decades of the twentieth century, but, from the evidence, there must have been other factors too. Better sanitation of all kinds was probably one such factor. In fact, the over‐all American death rate declined steadily from 1900 to about 1950. About then the improvement slowed to a virtual halt, for reasons that are still obscure. “This failure to experience a decline in mortality rates in the United States since about 1950 is little known, unexpected and extremely important,” ac cording to Dr. William H. Stewart, former Surgeon Gen eral of the Public Health Sere Pie blames two factors for the new trend. The firct of these is the suc cess of the last few decades in treating infectious disease. The degree of success was so mark ed and so rapid, he believes that there simply has not been room for enough further improve ment to make dramatic changes in mortality. The sccond tactor, he says,’ was the emergence of chronic diseases and accidents as “the great undertone of mortality” today. These causes of death are certainly not new, but their impact was less when so many died of acute infections. Paradoxically, the improve ments in medical care and public health are also bringing into sharper focus some of the effects on personal health that are more related to life style and socio‐economic status than to medical care itself. Experts guess that there are probably more than 200,000 narcotics addicts in the United States today, many of whom will die young after years of poverty, degradation and pain. The number of alcoholics and problem drinkers runs into the millions. Their final problems are always medical, but it was not failure of health care that first lured these men and wom en into the grim quicksand of the drug world. Even in more fortunate cir cumstances, life style probably puts a strong imprint on state of health. This is an area of many complexities and contra dictions but some salient points emerge. We kill 50,000 fellow citizens a year with that prime Ameri can weapon of violence, the automobile. Heart specialists say millions of Americans eat too much and exercise too little, and that many die early because of this. Some cancer specialists say we have virtually created our own epidemic of lung cancer, killing ourselves at the rate of more than 60,000 a year while we debate new gimmicks for breaking the smoking habit. Americans today are also widely believed to be the most over‐medicated society that has ever existed. An official of the Food and Drug Administration estimated recently that about two billion drug prescriptions year are written in this coun try. Recent studies suggest that a significant part of all this drug dosage does the patient little or no good and that many of the prescriptions are for drugs of doubtful value. Furthermore, it has been estimated that 1.5 million hos pital admissions a year are caused by bad reactions to medicinal drugs. While such things put their stamp on the quality of the na tion's health care, the total pic ture revealed by national statis tics is no more than a rough approximation. Dr. Theodore D. Woolsey, director of the National Center for Health Statistics, said re cently his organization was trying to develop better ways of measuring the state of Amer ican health. The center has started a continuing nutrition survey, for example, and is, looking into ways of gauging an important aspect of health that seldom finds its way into the statistics—the population's unmet needs. It is also looking, into a relatively new notion in health statistics, the concept of a person's years of disability free life. It is clear, for example, that American life expectancy has increased markedly since the early years of this century. The child born in 1900 lived, on the average, 49.24 years. The child born in 1970 had an av erage chance of 70.2 years. Much of the difference re flects the drop in the nation's infant mortality rate over those years, but the longevity figures do not tell the whole story. How much of the person's later years are impaired by serious chronic illness? That is the im portant factor the national cen ter is seeking now. Even with the conventional data available today it is clear that great inequities exist in American health. “Some care in this country is superb,” said Dr. Lester Bres low of the University of Cali fornia at Los Angeles, during a recent interview. “Other as pects are mediocre, some is very bad—and the poor tend to get the worst.” Indeed, migrant workers, In dians and blacks have more than their share of ill health. Although not all of the reasons are known, evidence points to poverty as a major factor. Nonwhite American babies die at a rate nearly twice that of white babies. Nonwhite mothers die at a rate four times that for white mothers. On the average, nonwhite Americans can expect to die seven years earlier than whites. An indication of the poverty factor in this is information showing that infant death rates in urban slums tend to be markedly higher than in pros perous neighborhoods in the same cities. Yet, in Denver, Dr. Thomas Sbarbaro said his community's neighborhood health centers had been able to reduce the infant mortality rate among the poor to the level of the city's prosperous residential areas. The program appears to have done so simply by provid ing proper health care for peo ple who never had it before. On the other hand, a study in another city showed that chronic disease rates among adults varied with the amount of air pollution in the neighbor hood, and that the poor lived in the most polluted areas, an other hint that health care is by no means the whole of the health story. Among the most difficult of the nation's unsolved health problems is heart disease. Few specialists think any changes in the health care system would have profound impact on this huge American health hazard. Recent data from the long term Framingham heart study, now closed down for lack of Federal funds, shows why. The study disclosed that half of all persons who died sudden ly, presumably from heart dis ease, had no previous evidence of that disease detectable by doctors. Even among those with known heart disease, almost half of all deaths occurred quickly and outside the hos pital. The authors concluded that the only road to any substantial reduction in premature death from heart attack would be prevention of the underlying disease itself. Some experts think this goal would require major changes in American life style. Others doubt that anyone knows with certainty what those changes ought to be. Few, if any, think the goal could be achieved with out a major commitment to long‐term research. Even in heart disease, pover ty emerges as a health factor. Rheumatic heart disease tends to be more common among the poor. Even coronary heart dis ease, the kind that often cul minates in a heart attack, seems to hit hardest in the lower income groups. The sta tistics show that it is not really a rich man's disease, despite popular opinion to the con trary. Not only in that health prob lem, but in most others, pover ty and illness are intertwined in the whole fabric of life. Poverty begets disease and ill ness begets poverty.

1477-> OFF‐FARM DRIFT WORRIES MOSCOW
MOSCOW, Oct. 3—A growing flight from the Russian countryside, especially by young people drawn to cities by higher wages, is giving increasing concern to the Soviet authorities. Agriculture has been traditionally one of the weakest sectors in the Soviet economy and, despite recent reforms, rises in farm labor productivity and mechanization do not appear to have offset the effect of the continuing exodus. The situation is said to be particularly serious in central Russia, the region around Moscow, where the rural population is reported to have declined more than 25 per cent between the censuses of 1959 and 1970. A side effect of the abandonment of rural communities has been a growing tendency of affluent city dwellers—scientists, artists, writers—to buy country homes in depopulated villages. The Government is reported to have moved to halt this practice in an apparent effort to stop the spread of private ownership of real estate. Prospective buyers are said to have been advised that they may acquire summer homes, or dachas, as they are called in Russian, only in suburban communities specifically designated for that purpose. If Muscovites insist on buying abandoned farmhouses at some distance from the city, they have been told, this will be considered an official change of domicile and they will lose the right to keep an apartment in Moscow. Residence is strictly controlled in the Soviet Union through a police‐registration system. In a review of the migrations from rural areas to cities, a noted Soviet demographer wrote last week that the process was entirely normal for a developing Industrial society and should in itself not be matter for concern. The author, Viktor I. Perevedentsev, warned, however, that the Government should take steps to stimulate outmigration from southern regions of the Soviet Union with heavy surplus of rural population and seek to slow the shift from northern areas suffering a shortage of farm labor. Writing in a weekly newspaper. Literaturnaya Gazeta, Mr. Perevedentsev noted that the 1970 census showed a decline in rural population in the Baltic republics. Byelorussia, the Ukraine and the Russian Republic, which extends from European Russia through Siberia to the Pacific. However, the number of people in rural areas was found to have risen in nine other republics, all situated in the southern tier of this vast nation. They are Moldavia, the three Caucasian republics of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, the Republic of Kazakhstan, and tthe four central Asia states — Uzbekistan, Kirghizia, Tadzhikistan and Turkmenia. The southward movement of Soviet population, of a magnitude that has now become evident, has replaced what used to be an eastward movement toward Siberia. That flow appears to have come to a standstill, and has even been reversed in some cases, largely because living conditions in Siberia have lagged behind those in the rest of the country. In a survey of rural migrants who moved to cities, the desire to improve incomes was cited as the principal cause, Mr. Perevedentsev reported. He said that the average monthly wage in industry in 1969 was 128 rubles ($142) compared with 93 rubles in agriculture. He said that the use by rural residents of a private garden plot was often cited as a balancing factor — that is, farmers could grow part of their food and sell the rest on the open market. However, the demographer noted, such reasoning often ignored the additional amount of work involved, in effect lowering the farmer's living level compared with that of the city dweller.

1478-> State Aides Scored in Albuquerque Riots
ALBUQUERQUE, N. M., June 15—The city's top elected official today accused the Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico and the State Attorney General of “inciting” yesterday's fourhour‐long riot by making speeches in which they agreed that the Albuquerque police had been “brutal to hippies, Mexican‐Americans and Negroes. Albuquerque City Commission Chairman Charles Barnhart said that the speeches by Lieut. Gov. Robert Mondrogan and Attorney General David Norvell were “racist” and had incited the volatile crowd to create disturbanes. The riots, in which 12 persons were hurt, were not brought under control until last night when 500 New Mexico National Guardsmen, moving out under a cloud of tear gas, helped the city police arrest 289 demonstrators, many of whom were throwing fire bombs and stones at the police. Squads of Guardsmen patrolled Albuquerque streets today in an effort to restore calm to the city, which has been under periodic siege from “street” people and militant minorities since Sunday afternoon. In the two days of rioting, 41 persons have been hurt and more than 400 have been arrested. Damage, mostly from arson and from broken windows, has been estimated at $3‐million. The patrols on duty today were put together from a contingent of 1,300 guardsmen who were rushed to Albuquerque from a summer encampment at El Paso. City and state officials did not consider the situation to be under control today but the city refused to order a citywide curfew. The police were told to prevent mass meetings “for unlawful purposes” but to allow other meetings. A 7 P.M. curfew for meetings of five persons or more was lifted. Mr. Mondragon and Mr. Norveil had told a mass meeting called by a Mexican‐American and Negro coalition, the Black Berets, that the state would investigate allegations of police brutality in Albuquerque. ‘It Is Not Alleged’ “I know we have had police brutality,” the Lieutenant Governor said. “It is not alleged but factual.” Some 300 to 400 demonstrators, almost all of them ranging in age from 15 to 25, streamed from Roosevelt Park after the Black Beret rally, and many of them ran down U. S. 66, Albuquerque's main east‐west street, breaking store windows and overturning cars. Merchants along the highway, which is named Central Avenue in the city, were critical of city policemen who watched the rioters throw stones, bottles and fire bombs without making any effort to stop them. The police acted only after the riotous crowd, which had eluded the state police by crossing the campus of the University of New Mexico, made second attack on an automobile agency where about 100 new automobiles were sitting in parking lots. Policemen fired tear gas across the parking lots to disperse the group of demonstrators, who were breaking windows in the cars. It was not until four hours later, at 7:30 P.M., Mountain Daylight time, that the police and the National Guard made an attempt to arrest any of the rioters. The city administration said this morning that it had waited until the National Guard was available before trying to control the situation.

1479-> Crowds in Alabama Give Nixon Warm Welcome
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., May 25 —President Nixon toured the heart of George Wallace coun try today, calling for unity and cooperation between the races and receiving, in the process, a warm welcome that may well rekindle his hopes of capturing heavier Southern support in 1972. The novelty of a Presidential visit to these parts plus the presence of Governor Wallace, who shared the platform with Mr. Nixon in Mobile and flew with him and three other South ern Governors on the Birming ham leg, gave the day all the flavor and trappings of a Presi dential campaign. Although it was difficult to distinguish between those who came to see him out of affection and those who were merely curious, the crowds that lined the streets and jammed the in tersections in both Mobile and Birmingham for Mr. Nixon's first Alabama visit since as suming office were large and enthusiastic. Mr. Nixon returned the com pliment, in both deed and word. He stopped his motorcade fre quently to leap from his car and shake hands, and when he touched on the sensitive racial issue in an informal speech to editors and publishers in Bir mingham he suggested that the South had made more progress than the North in desegregating public schools. “I have nothing but utter contempt for the double, hypo critical standards of those Northerners who look at the South and say: Why don't those Southerners do some thing about their race prob lem,” he said. The President then went on to cite statistics released by the Department of Health, Edu cation and Welfare in January showing that 38 per cent of black children in the South now attend schools with white majorities, as opposed to 28 per cent in the North. He as serted that the North had made no perceptible inroads on the problem of racial isolation in the public schools in two years. There were virtually no anti war demonstrators in either city and—with the exception of a few mothers in Mobile carrying signs lettered “America Should Mean Freedom of Choice”— there was little visible evidence that Southerners were holding Mr. Nixon personally responsi ble for recent Supreme Court decisions speeding the pace of school desegregation. Mindful, perhaps, that both Mobile and Birmingham will soon have to undertake more busing of Negro and white pupils to carry out the Court's orders, the President urged his audiences to resolve their dif ferences “in a peaceful and con structive way.” “We cannot be a strong na tion in a spiritual and moral land ideological sense if we are torn apart by regional differ ences, by racial differences, by religious differences, by differ ences between states, by dif Iferences between state govern ment and Federal Government,” he told a crowd gathered at the Alabama state docks in Mobile, this morning for a ceremony dedicating the beginning of the Tennessee ‐Tombigbee Water way. He said that such differences were not easily erased and would persist, but he added: “Let us remember that what we must do is join together in working out those differences in a peaceful and constructive way... Let Americans today be united, North, East, West and South, all races and de ligions, for the great goals of peace, prosperity and opportunity for every American and every people in the world today.” The ostensible purpose of the President's visit to Mobile this morning was to begin construc tion on the Tennessee‐Tombig bee Waterway Project, planned as a 253‐mile link between the Tennessee River at the lower end of the Ohio River Basinl and the Gulf of Mexico. His visit to Birmingham this afternoon, meanwhile, was de signed orginally to marshal support for his domestic pro grams among editors and pub lishers from 12 Southern states who assembled here and were briefed by high Administration officials. Mr. Nixon spoke to them at the conclusion of the briefing. Although the welcome In Mo bile seemed the warmer of the two, there was evidence of first‐rate advance work in both cities. His well‐wishers seemed well‐equipped with signs and flags, and in Mobile the Presi dent was able to take advan tage of a lunchtime crowd. Mr. Wallace, by contrast, re ceives a few scattered boos when the two men appeared in front of the Parliament Hotel here before the editor's brief ing.

1480-> The Science of Caring
BRISTOL, England—It is not given to us mortals to perceive the full consequences of our actions. Moral responsibility is therefore an issue that cannot be decided by scientific pro cedures. When an evil is traced back to a cause that we have freely created, we can almost always produce an excuse. “I had no idea that this would hap pen, Sir!”— thus, perhaps, Rutherford, for splitting the atom. “It was all in a good cause, Sir!” — the discoverers of DDT. “If I hadn't done it, Sir, some body else would!”—nuclear fission, shall we say. Every such excuse is valid, however essentially infantile. The scientist is not in the front line, pulling triggers and dumping defoliants. In the complex of social institutions within which we try to make ourselves at home on earth, the mind and pro fessional expertise of the individual scientist is not a negligible force. The enormous size of the technical com munity seems to guarantee anonymity and to countenance irresponsibility, yet the intellectual leader carries ten thousand of his colleagues with him in a “break‐through,” and sets ten million humble laborers on a new course of manufacture, commerce and use. We scientists cannot take personal pride in the “achievements” of our science and technology and simultaneously repudiate responsibility for its failures and abuses. We are either humble workers in the vineyard — or we are indeed the New Men come to make better world. I see no salvation in resolves or resolutions, however aptly phrased and apparently benevolent. To accept them without reservation is essentially to abjure responsibility; it is the aban donment of judgment and a flight from rationality itself. An innocuous pledge can do no good until it is called into question, when precisely the issue of interpretation in particular unforeseen circumstances must be faced. It is then that we must rely again upon our spiritual and intellectual resources: the will to do good, the imagination of suffering, the rational calculation of the consequences of action or inaction. Social responsibility in science rests therefore upon the way in which scien tists are made. Whether or not we have the inborn talents for success in research, we are molded by upbring ing and ethcation. But social respon sibility is not a subject to be learned from a course of lectures. It is not something one can practice ostenta tiously, as an example to the young. It is an attitude of mind, a sensibility of the spirit implicit in an educational system, in personal relations, in insti tutional policies. We instill into our technologists the highest professional standards, so that they are rightly suspicious of the claims of anyone but an expert in their own field—and then we entrust them with tasks that demand expert judgment over many fields. How can the aircraft engine designer take re sponsible decisions about noise? Our specialized courses of study— pure physics, pure chemistry, pure bio chemistry, even pure medicine and pure engineering—are absurd and non sensical as a training for active life, whether in research itself or in tech nical development. The interdiscipli nary, technological, historical and economic aspects of our academic dis ciplines must be taught, positively, wisely, expensively and at length. We must also deal with the political and moral questions associated with science. A course in civics in grade 5B is not enough, nor is any amount of doctrinaire Marxism. The Industrial Revolution was a political event with deep moral consequences, not merely a triumph of technique. How was it possible, we must ask, for the rivers and winds of our beau tiful land to be so bemired? What forces of greed or ambition drove on the mill owners and railway builders —and by what other forces were their monstrous pretensions curbed? How do political and economic forces exert their leverage, and to what extent is science harnessed to anti‐human jug gernauts? The questions are countless, the moral and political considerations con flicting, tangled and subtle. We need immense drafts of discussion and ar gument on all such topics, in the seminar room, round the coffee table, in debates, study groups, and tutorials, as strengthening medicines for the grown‐up world in which these issues will assume reality. We must somehow sensitize these earnest owlish experts early to think of people, of pain, of freedom, and of beauty. When they are middle‐aged and grey‐haired, and with the power at last to make such decisions, it will be too late. Sophistry and calculation will then have taken over: the spiritual lobes in their ponderous noddles will have died for sheer lack of exercise.

1481-> Corporate Earnings Rose From 1970 Third Quarter
Through the economic smog overhanging the nation, one patch of blue is clearly visible corporate profits are up for the third consecutive quarter this year. A hefty fourth‐quarter advance over the strike influenced period of 1970 may put this year's profits at a near‐record level. Third‐quarter profits of 1,267 nonfinancial corporations rose 11 per cent to $7,010,800,000 from $6,319,200;000 in the simi. lar three months last year, according to a tabulation by the First National City Bank released today. However, there was a decline of 10 per cent from this year's second‐quarter total of $7,753,200,000. This reflected in part the sharp drop in third‐quarter results of steel producers after the rise in profits in the first two quarters, which came partly from strike‐hedge buying. Profits of nonferrous metals companies were down 90 per cent both from a year earlier and from the second quarter, while for the 32 iron and steel corporations in the survey third‐quarter operations resulted in a net loss, the bank noted. For the first nine months this year net income was up 9 per cent to $21,817,000,000 from the, year‐earlier $19,965,900,000. The growth in profits was well distributed, with 25 of the 30 industries in the survey ahead of the third quarter last year. Altogether, nearly three out of every four concerns improved profits in the third quarter, and two out of three showed better earnings in the nine, months over the 1970 period. Although seven of every 10 manufacturing companies managed to better last year”s earnings, slightly less than half showed a gain over the second quarter, City Bank said. A major factor in the year‐to‐year increase in manufacturers' earnings and the quarterto‐quarter performance was the automobile industry. Without the huge upsurge in auto earnings, manufacturing profits would have been up only 2 per cent on a year‐to‐year basis, it was noted. Accelerated inventory liquidations by customers depressed third‐quarter shipments of steel companies, and industry results plummeted in some cases to their lowest quarterly level since the prolonged steel strike in the 1959 third quarter. The upswing in homebuilding activity ccontributed to higher earnings than Iast year for building materials concerns. The airlines made inspiring comebacks. Even the aerospace companies, although still lower than last year, showed improved earnings over earlier periods this year, reflecting heavy layoffs and intensive cost‐control programs. The rise in sales volume for the 30 industries contributed prominently to the gain. Profit margins showed little improvement. At 4.7 cents per dollar of sales, they were about the same as reported for the 1970 third quarter and down from 5.3 cents in the 1971 second quarter. In its November economic letter, First National describes the United States economy in 1972 as “a winner.” The rate of advance in real output “will be the most rapid in its six years,” it states. “The uncertainties caused by the price and wage restraints in Phase Two of the President's new economic policy have not colored this assessment of the likely course of the economy next year although they are factor in the recent stock market decline,” the bank said. The greatest danger is a resurgence of inflation in late 1972 and 1973, when the margin of slack in the economy has been significantly reduced, City Bank said.

1483-> Formosa's Future
ANN ARBOR, Mich.—The U.N. deci sion seating Peking and expelling Taipei—plus President Nixon's pro posed visit to the mainland—under score the tangle of the Formosan is sue. And now as world leaders finally admit the absurdities of Nationalist Chinese fantasies, a new myth emerg es: that Formosa has been and must be an integral part of China, and that in order for China to achieve, full sovereignty she must annex Formosa. In reality, Formosa's connection to China before 1895 was so loose as to be almost nominal and relations were tumultuous. In the last 75 years the island has had fewer than four years of union with China, 1945–1949, and those were by no means the happiest in Formosan history. In 1947 an up rising occurred, which resulted in the massacre of over 20,000 Formosan leaders. Native Formosans are of Chi nese extraction, but have shared cen turies of experience unique to them and have developed their own identity. Joined after the Second World War by over 2,000,000 continental Chinese now also cut off for more than 20 years from the experience of the new China, all the people in Formosa now have no more connection to China than Americans have to Britain. More over, Formosa's legal status has been undetermined since 1945. Furthermore, China's emotional claims to Formosa have nothing to do with its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Early in this century, when China was struggling to attain full sovereignty, Formosa was never an issue. Mao. Tse‐tung nimself, drawing an analogy with Korea, expressed his readiness to support an independent Formosa. It was only after 1949, when the exiled Nationalists used the island as a base for aggression against China, that Peking's attitude toward Formosa became belligerent. Certain basic points must be kept in mind in seeking a solution to the Formosan problem. First, the U.S. can not maintain its military presence in Formosa permanently. Second, China cannot simply annex Formosa. Third, the Nationalists cannot maintain their rule in Formosa on such an absurd basis. Fourth, the people of Formosa cannot live in a state of hostility with China. Fifth, the unique history and identity of the people on Formosa can not be disregarded, nor their aspira tion to decide their denied. Many Chinese in the U.S. still insist that Formosa must be a part of China, which in fact means rule either by the Peking or the Taipei Government. Yet they themselves have chosen to live under neither Chinese regime and have never considered Formosa to be their homeland. The Chinese must learn to distin guish ethnic origin and culture from politics and law and to discard their archaic obsession to claim anyone of Chinese ancestry as legally Chinese, however far removed from China. They must stop vilifying as traitors those who desire self‐determination and understand that one can be proud of his Chinese heritage and still choose not to be subject to government by China. The real issue is not independence for Formosa but self‐determination for the people there. And the For‐ mosan people want to live in the most friendly association with the Chinese people and would spare no effort to establish the closest economic, com mercial, cultural and even political ties with China. Any settlement of the sovereignty over Formosa must come through peaceful negotiations in which the people of Formosa are fully and ef fectively represented. No one from out side may dictate to Formosans to whom they should belong. Neither Peking nor Washington can speak for them. The present regime in Taipei never has spoken legitimately for the ma jority on Formosa. It cannot do so unless it undergoes a basic struc tural change and the Formosan ma jority is represented effectively at every level. gan. He to the delegation

1484-> About Pro Hockey
Rod Gilbert, the leading scorer for the, leading club in the National Hockey League, wasn't smiling yesterday when he said: “We got to finish first. The last two years we were up there. But this is the season. I don't think any of us will be satisfied with second place.” Most of the Rangers said that it was too early, that it was a long season. But Jean Ratelle summed it up succinctly: “We're clicking.” Yet football and basketball have conspired to put the Rangers in a secondary place in the minds of sports fans here. “It's nothing new,” said Rod Selling. “That's the way it is in New York. When football and basketball seasons are over, people will start talking baseball.” • At the start of a two‐day meeting here, the league, which had agreed that a unanimous vote of the 14 teams should be required for expanding before 1974, suddenly changed its mind. It lowered the number of necessary votes to 12. The move frustrated Charles O. Finley's plans. The controversial owner of the California Golden Seals would like to move his Club from Oakland. If he couldn't, he would have wanted concessions to vote for expansion. Most observers expect an expansion plan that will add teams from Long Island and. Atlanta perhaps as early as next year. Then the 16 teams probably would be divided into four‐team divisions. Finley wants at least two established clubs in his division, so that the fans can be attracted. Since league officials have said they do not want to increase the present 78‐game schedule, the four‐division setup would mean that clubs would play more games in its division than out. Roy Boe, who expects to get the Long Island franchise, and Bill Jennings, the Rangers' president, who will give him one for a $5‐million indemnification, have denied reports that one of Jennings' sons will be an executive of the Long Island team. “As a lawyer, Jennings would have to be crazy to suggest such a deal,” said Boe. “He could leave himself and Madison Square Garden open to all sorts of actions.” Jennings said, “It's news to me,” when asked about it.

1486-> U.S. PRESSES ISSUE OF PRISONER MAIL
PARIS, Dec. 2—William J. Porter, the American delegate to the Vietnam peace talks, pressed North Vietnam again today to permit “a normal flow of mail” from American prisoners held there. Mr. Porter charged four weeks ago that mail from only 50 prisoners had been received this year by the prisoners’ families, whereas almost all the 339 prisoners that Hanoi acknowledges it holds had written last year. Stephen Ledogar, the American delegation's press spokesman, said no mail from prisoners had been received in the United States in the last month. Xuan Thuy, the North Vietnamese representative, avoided a direct answer. His spoksman, Nguyen Than Le, insisted that prisoners were authorized to write once a month and that this policy had not been changed. Mr. Le did not explain the discrepancy, but other North Vietnamese said that perhaps the prisoners were not writing. Mr. Thuy charged that Mr. Porter was bringing up the prisoner question as a maneuver to mask the American policy of prolonging the war and of refusing to accept the peace terms of the other side.

1487-> Lindsay Tours a Methadone Clinic
Mayor Lindsay visited the. city's 14th methadone center yesterday — in the heart of the financial district — and was told by a patient being treated for heroin addiction that the program was “lifesaver.” The clinic, which was opened Jan. 25, has 44 patients, 10 of them women. It is hoped that by the end of the summer 150 patients will be under treatment there. The patients live at home and a number of them are employed in the financial district. The program is supervised by the city's Health Services Administration and the clinc, at 74 Trinity Place, is operated by Trinity Church under the, medical supervision of the Beekman‐Downtown Hospital. By the end of the summer, the Mayor said, the city will have 22 such clinics serving 2,750 patients. The city is seeking $9.2‐million from the state to expand the program to reach 9,000 heroin addicts. The Mayor spoke to one of the patients, a 26‐year‐old printer who said he had been an addict for six years. The patient was enthusiastic about the methadone program, saying: “I don't care if methadone is addictive. It's been a lifesaver. I don't have to live like an addict any more—the lowest form of life.” Methadone is an addictive, synthetic drug. The doctors who endorse its use contend that it blocks the craving for heroin. When given orally to addicts who are tolerant to it, methadone does not give the euphoria associated with the intravenous use of heroin.

1488-> Kerkorian Is Victor Over Dissidents at M‐G‐M Meeting
CULVER CITY, Calif., Dec. 8 —As expected, Kirk Kerkorian, owner of 39 per cent of MetroGoldwyn‐Mayer, Inc., prevailed at the annual meeting here today. But some stockholders angrily expressed the wish that Mr. Kerkorian had attended the session as well. The chief issue at stake was the proposed purchase by M‐G‐M of the Bonanza Hotel and related properties in Las Vegas, Nev., for some $5‐million from the companys' largest stockholder, Mr. Kerkorian. Several stockholders voiced opposition to the plan, charging Mr. Kerkorian would be the sole benefactor, in a blustery three‐hour session in the Veterans Memorial Auditorium across from M‐G‐M's studio headquarters. But the measure was overhwelmingly passed, receiving 1,937,731 shares for, compared with 301,991 against, without Mr. Kerkorian's shares counted. James T. Aubrey Jr., president, told the meeting that management had accomplished its goal of turning the company around, noting that profits in the fiscal year ended Aug. 31 were the highest for the company in 25 years. He said earnings for the first fiscal quarter ended in November were not yet available, but would show a profit. Mr. Aubrey said he believed that pattern would continue through the rest of the year. He said sales of real estate had resulted in reducing debt from $82.5‐million at Aug. 31, 1969, to $14,300,000 in the fall of 1971. After a subsequent acquisition, debt now stands at $18,542,000, he said. Most of the heated debate at the meeting focused on the purchase of the Las Vegas properties for Mr. Kerkorian. Several stockholders joined John J. Gilbert and Mrs. Evelyn Y. Davis—frequent attenders of annual meetings — in expressing “outrage” that Mr. Kerkorian was not present. Because of Mr. Kerkorian's absence and in light of the discussion of a Las Vegas deal, stockholders repeatedly invoked the mute of Howard Hughes, the billionaire who has not been seen in public in decades. “Has Mr. Kerkorian met personally with you in California?” asked Mrs. Ethel Rudick, a stockholder, of Mr. Aubrey. “Yes, I see him regularly — at least every two weeks,” was the reply. “It seems remarkable that he meets regularly with you, but he's not at the annual meeting. It's a strange phenomenon,” Mrs. Rudick said. “It all depends—on how well you know, Mr. Kerkorian,” Mr. Aubrey said. “I think it's very good question . . . but you will have to ask Mr. Kerkornan.” M‐G‐M proposed to purchase the Las Vegas property, incorporated as T. L. Corporation, as part of its diversification program

1489-> Ford Criticizes Pay and Price Boards
DETROIT, Dec. 8 — Henry Ford 2d accused the pay and price boards today of helping to create a “depressing” uncertainty in the nation that was holding back economic recovery. The chairman of the Ford Motor Company has been considered a liberal among businessmen because of his outspoken support for various social causes. But he has also been the loudest defender of the automobile industry against its critics, and today's public criticism of the Federal boards was as sharp as any made by a major business leader. And, in a year‐end statement, Mr. Ford also attacked Congress for passing pollution laws that he said were impossible to comply with and, in effect, stated that his company probably could not meet auto antipollution goals set for 1975 and 1976. Mr. Ford said that “recovery from the 1969–70 recession had been slow and consumer and business purchases have been restrained by continuing lack of confidence in the business outlook.” Next year's business depends heavily on the success of Phase Two of the Administration's economic program, he added, and “we support the basic directions of the Administration's program, including price and wage controls and the steps that must be taken to achieve more realistic currency ‐ exchange rates.” But it was even difficult “to know what should be done, and even more difficult, from the standpoint of practical politics, to do what should be done,” Mr. Ford stated, adding: “This is evident as we see the depressing effect of continuing uncertainty over the effects and the duration of Phase Two. There is uncertainty as to whether or not over‐all wage and price levels—as opposed to some wages and some prices—will in fact be controlled. There is uncertainty as to whether or not the controls will permit a level of profits adequate to stimulate the investment and other commitments by business needed for economic growth. And there is uncertainty as to the long‐term repercussions on our own economy of the present controls on International trade.” “Under Phase Two, some goals must be sacrificed so that others can be achieved. But there are serious risks of making the wrong choices and compromises and thereby doing more harm than good. There Is a real risk, based on the Pay Board's decisions thus far, that the economic program will do little to limit underlying cost pressures. If these pressures are not contained, either inflationcontrol will turn out to be short‐lived or profits will be severely restricted. A profit squeeze would undermine both the hoped‐for business expansion in 1972 and our long‐term economic growth. The Pay Board announced a 8.5 per cent a year guideline figure for wage increases and has been criticized because it approved a much larger pay increase for coal miners. Labor leaders also have said that the board privately told major unions, in transportation and in aerospace and the like, that pay increases well beyond the guideline would be approved. If Phase Two policies were reasonably effective, Mr. Ford said, “We believe that the present recovery from the 1969–70 recession will build to a faster pace” next year with a 5 per cent growth in real gross national product. This assumes that the investment tax credit would be passed and that “the Federal Reserve will move quickly to achieve a sustained moderate increase in the money supply,” he added. But “in contrast” to the uncertainty that, he complained about in the domestic economic program, Mr. Ford said that the international measures “will clearly benefit the United States economy.” He also forecast sales of 10.5 million cars in this country next year against 10.2 million this year, including sales of imported cars. And, important to the American economy, he predicted, was that the import growth — 1.6 million foreign cars will be sold in the United States this year would be stopped in 1972. This means that sales of United Statestype cars will run around 9 million next year, up 5 per cent from 8.6 million this year, he forecast. Ford's own capital spending will climb 24 per cent to almost $800‐million, a record, in 1972, Mr. Ford said in his statement, up from $645‐million this year with about $440‐million of that in the United States, up 14 per cent from $387‐million spent in the United States last year. But, of the capital‐spending gain, the biggest chunk, $102‐million according to the Ford figures, will come outside the United States.

WASHINGTON, March 24 (AP)—The Senate approved to‐day the nomination of Frank C. Carlucci 3d to be director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, ending a three‐moth delay that stemmed from a dispute over a California Poverty program. The nomination was approved without dissent. Mr. Carlucci had been serving under a recess appointment by President Nixon, after Senator Alan J. Cranston, Democrat of California, blockgd action late in the last Congress. Mr. Cranston acted in an effort to gain approval of a grant for the California Rural Legal Assistance program, which Gov. Ronald Reagan sought to veto. It has since been funded on an interim, six‐month basis.

1493-> Reagan, Heckled, Pledges Welfare Reform
SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan. 4 —Speaking over the chants of a crowd of radicals espousing the cause of welfare recipients, Gov. Ronald Reagan promised today to restructure the welfare sys tem “to eliminate waste and the impropriety of subsidizing those whose greed is greater than their need.” The crowd of about 100 chanters was made up entirely of young people who looked and talked much like the radi cals whose activities around college campuses provided the conservative Republican Gov ernor with one of his most re liable political issues during his first four‐year term. They carried signs such as “Poor People's Liberation Front,” “Don't let our kids starve” and “Ronnie loves me — this I know — because the rich man told me so.” A leaflet distributed by some demonstra tors was signed “Friends of Progressive Labor party.” During one part of the in augural ceremonies on the west steps of the Capitol an orange sailed out of a crowd of demon strators and was caught smoothly by Houston I. Flour ney, the State Controller, while Mrs. Ed Reinecke, wife of the Lieutenant Governor, jumped aside. Except for this, the demon stration was confined to chants that were frequently obscene. These were mostly downed by the sound amplification system. “Welfare has proliferated and grown into a leviathan of unsupportable dimensions,” Mr. Reagan said. “There is no limit to the potential growth of the present welfare structure, short of total redistribution of the earnings of all who earn and produce” The Governor appeared to political observers here to be attempting to stake out a na tional leadership position with in, the Republican party. That position would oppose the wel fare proposals advanced by President Nixon, most notably in regard to the guaranteed family income proposals that Congress failed to pass. At a recent meeting of Re publican governors in Sun Val ley, Idaho, Mr. Reagan outspokenly opposed the guaran teed income proposal. He also recently vetoed a grant by the Office of Economic Opportu nity, of $1.8‐million to Cali fornia Rural Legal Assistance. Caspar W. Weinberger, for merly Mr. Reagan's budget di rector and now in a similar capacity in the national Admin istration, was introduced today as “President Nixon's personal representative” at the Reagan inaugural. Earl Warren, former Chief Justice of the United States and former Governor of California, also attended. Mr. Reagan did not detail his welfare reorganization plan today. He said he would make his proposals in a speech to the Legislature next Tuesday. His remarks today developed the theme that welfare costs were eating up the state budget, and that the programs them selves were destructive of the moral fiber of the recipients. “Here in California nearly a million children are growing up in the stultifying atmosphere of programs that reward people for not working,” the Governor said, “programs that separate families and doom these chil dren to repeat the cycle in their own adulthood.” “Common sense and simple fairness suggest reducing grants to those with outside income in order to increase our ability to help the totally dependent,” he said.

1494-> CITY REPORTS GAIN ON DERELICT CARS
A total of 72,961 derelict vehicles—about 200 a day— were removed from the streets here in 1970 under the Sanita tion Department's abandoned car program, Acting Commis sioner Jerome Kretchmer said yesterday. The pick‐ups have more than doubled in the last three years. In 1968 the program accounted for 31,578 vehicles; in 1969 the pick‐up total was 57,742. The vehicles are hauled off and shredded or pounded into scrap—or in many cases they are stacked six and seven high for long weeks in piles under the Manhattan approach to the Brooklyn Bridge pending final disposition. Deputy Sanitation Commis sioner Carl I. Butler, in charge of the removal program, has speeded operations by turning over most of the towing opera tions to private contractors. These companies remove abandoned cars in all five bor oughs except the area south of 86th Street in Manhattan where the Sanitation Department it self does the work. Mr. Kretchnmer said that the abandoned car operation was “one of the most successful programs in the department” and without cost to the tax payers. Under the contract system the city is paid from 21 cents to $4.05 every time an aban doned car is picked up, the price varying with the location of the vehicle, the department said.

1498-> Screen: Confrontations in 'Branches':Ed Emshwiller's Work Comes to Film Forum Portrays Fantasy Role of College Students
Ed Emshwiller began making movies in 1959, and ever since he has in one connection or another figured as among the best of those filmmakers who used to be, and maybe still are, known as the New American Cinema. Emshwiller is a cinematographer of considerable accomplishment, and even those who have not much cared for his films ("Thanotopsis," 1962; "Relativity," 1966; etc.) have admired their camera work. In his collaborations with others, for example as photographer of "Hallelujah the Hills" (1962), it is difficult to say much about Emshwiller's contribution that isn't praise."Branches," which opened last night at the Film Forum, where it will play on Thursday through Sunday evenings for the next two weekends, represents something of a collaboration. During the summer of 1970, Emshwiller was in residence at Cornell University where, together with a good many students, he made this film—which I trust was as much fun to put together as it now is to see.As the film's hero (Bill Weidner—long-haired, bearded, and always wearing an undershirt marked with No. 1) sits in the student union listening to a friend (Christian Larson) tell a tale of improbable sexual success, he notices a pretty girl (Connie Brady) at the next table and fantasizes an affair with her. There may also actually be an affair. "Branches" is at no pains to clarify this, and I doubt that it matters much.What does matter is the succession of comic confrontations, somewhere between blackout skit and dramatic agon, that are the film's substance and the better part of its style.Actually there is rather too much style in the serious-cinema sense — superimposed images, repetitions of actions with minor variations, a chorus that alternately praises and blames the hero for obvious reasons. At its most pretentious worst, "Branches" looks a lot like a college arts festival, with much expressive formalism, a collection of modern dancers, and a ballerina who occasionally wanders through in the background.But at its least pretentious best it looks more like some of the nicer parts of college itself—intelligent, clever, at ease with its own discomforts. Bill is the kind of seducer who gets rejected even in his own fantasies, so I find him easy to identify with. And in the course of the little sketches, the returns to the battlefield of the daybed, that identification becomes an increasingly more rewarding pleasure.There are several other confrontations (all the talk is improvised, I understand)—between Bill and an art-as-politics freak, between Bill and a Black Power theoretician, between both Bill and Connie and a women's liberationist and, best of all, a girl (Erica Saxe) forthrightly on the make for Bill. I loved the last and her rage at the beautiful Connie ("You are an evil person. Your hair is evil!"). But I loved Connie more—her reserve, her coldness, her appetites, her complexities, her arrogant good looks.Near the end, Emshwiller, who is old enough to appreciate a bit of sexual metamorphosis, dances her into a tree. He is very good at this sort of thing, and in "Branches," by grace of the life he fosters around himself, he earns his ecstasy.

1499-> Italian Company Hit by Take‐Over Bid
ROME, Sept. 15—A take over bid by an unidentified international group aimed at one of Italy's largest holding companies has caused sudden excitement on the chronically sluggish stock markets in this country. The target of the attempted raid, said to be the first of its kind in Italian financial history, is a 109‐year‐old concern that is generally known as Bastogi. Its official name is Societa Italiana per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali. Founded for the expansion of the railroad network in south ern Italy, which was later na tionalized, Bastogi subsequent ly was transformed into an in vestment company with inter ests in real estate, mines and the chemical and cement in dustries. Bastogi today owns a com paratively small, but strategic, bloc of 3.5 per cent of the shares of Montecatini Edison S.p.A., the ailing giant that is the largest mining and chem ical concern on the European continent. Montedison, as the group is commonly referred to, has for the last few years been in the throes of a power struggle in volving corporate factions, the state‐controlled industry and private stockholders. Financial analysts here think that the present Bastogi oper ation is connected with the Montedison situation. Bastogi has lately been promoting a merger with three other financ ing groups to become the larg est private holding company in Italy and strengthen the still predominant private sector among Montedison's sharehold ers in the face of growing state influence in that concern. A West German bank, the Westdeutsche Landesbank Giro zentrale of Dtisseldorf Milnster, acting as agent for the inter national group that wants to take over Bastogi, today pub lished a tender in the Italian press offering to purchase stock. The offer for 20 million Bas togi shares at the price of 2,800 lire each ($4.54) expires on Oct. 8. Bastogi stock, which had been soaring lately, closed at 2,107 lire a share on Italian exchanges last Friday, jumped to 2,500 Monday and closed at 2,639 in heavy trading on the Milan exchange yesterday. Public tender offers for the purchase of stock, frequent in the United States and in West ern European financial centers, are a novelty for Italy. Finan cial commentators in Milan and here welcomed the Bastogi op eration yesterday as a sign that the long‐neglected small inves tor was at last being wooed. The press here also was filled with rumors that a “mystery man” of Italian finance, Michele Sindona, had a role in the attempted Bastogi raid. Mr. Sindona, a Milan finan cier of Sicilian extraction who has so far managed to attract little publicity, is known to have the backing of interna tional groups and to control a holding company registered in the Principality of Liechenstein, a tax haven. The financier is said to have acted as an adviser to the Vatican in its recent moves to diversify its substantial hold ings and shift assets from Italy to other countries, including the United States. Newspapers here have linked Mr. Sindona lately with Gulf & Western Industries, Inc., a conglomerate, and the Hambros Bank of London. Last Sunday Italy's only Eng lish‐language newspaper, The Daily American of Rome, an nounced that Mr. Sindona had become its chairman and presi dent following the publication's purchase hy an international group. According to financial ana lysts here, the group repre sented by the West German bank already controls a sizable number of Bastogi shares and would become the concern's majority stockholder if it were able to buy 20 million more shares.
