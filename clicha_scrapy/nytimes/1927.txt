1-> MOTION AND REST.
For once we can't follow AGNES REPPLIER. In the February Forum she tells us that "pleasure in motion is fundamental and universal." Isn't that too broad a statement? There are plenty of static and sedentary folk averse to motion, save in the "pictures," if they can muster resolution enough to drag thither their bland and portly bodies.

8-> MUSIC
Serge Rachmaninoff is certainly one of the simplest and the greatest pianists now before the public. His recital yesterday afternoon in Carnegie Hall did not discover this fact; it only reminded us of it. No one projects a musical ideal, a dramatic emotion, with less of self-advertisement in the communication. 
--------
9-> EDUCATION IN HAWAII.; Public School System Is Said to Follow American Lines.
In THE TIMES for July 24 is an editorial, "Hawaii, Oriental or Occidental?" It is written in a very sane and fair-minded spirit, but it is in part based upon misinformation. The following lines are quoted from the editorial:

WARSAW, July 6. -- The trial of General Zymierski, who defended the city of Warsaw against Marshal Pilsudski during the May revolution last year, continued its gruelling examination of witnesses today, though the majority of the long cross-examinations seemed irrelevant to the charge against the General of corruption in the purchase of 1,000,000 gas masks for the Polish Army from 1924 to 1926. 
--------
19-> BONDS ACTIVE AND FIRM ON STOCK EXCHANGE; Effect of Cheaper Money Offset by Volume of New Issues -- Foreign Loans Advance.
The listed bond market was active and firm yesterday.

Neither the New York Federal Reserve Bank nor the Bank of England reduced its discount rate yesterday.

48-> We Could Avoid Blundering by Studying the Customs of Others.
THE TIMES editorial "Excellent Intentions" strikes a new note in all this pother over a regrettable situation, and I enjoyed it very much.

NICARAGUAN MOVE SCORED London Thinks We Are "Getting Into a Mess," With the Monroe Doctrine Running Wild.
LONDON, Jan. 8. -- London and New York are talking to each other by wireless telephone. New York evidences more enthusiasm than does London. Perhaps that is due to London's more phlegmatic temperament; perhaps, also, it is due a little or a lot to the quicker appreciation which New York generally shows in regard to something novel.

57-> PATIENCE AND REASON.
There is no denying that the successive steps taken by the Washington Administration in the Nicaraguan matter have made a bad impression both at home and abroad.

63-> THE SCREEN; An Hour of Real Fun.
W. C. Fielda, the veteran stage comedian, has struck his stride as a screen actor in the picturization of J. P. McEvoy's play, "The Potters." Yesterday afternoon this film aroused many a round of hearty laughter from the large audience in the Paramount Theatre.The rôle of "Pa" Potter fits Mr. Fields like the proverbial glove. His performance is a real achievement, for he has resisted the temptation to be extravagent or to duplicate his mirthful actions. The moods of "Pa" Potter are reflected admirably by Mr. Fields, and whether it is a lowering of an eyelid, a gesture of his right hand, a frown or look of exuberance, one feels delighted with this Mr. Potter. The tale contains a nice quota of suspense, and the adapters, Sam Mintz and Ray Harris, have been far more restrained in translating this stage effort into a scenario than is usually the case.Fred Newmeyer, who directed several of the most successful of Harold Lloyd's comedies, is to be congratulated on his sound work in producing this picture. He has kept the story on an even keel and has permited the romance between Mamie Potter and "Red" Miller to stay within its proper limits. And although "Pa" Potter is the centre of attraction, he never appears to be trying to steal anybody else's thunder.The first scene in this production is in itself distinctive and it starts the story bowling merrily along. It is that of a coffee pot boiling over. And then there is "Ma" Potter, impersonated by Mary Alden, busy getting the family breakfast ready. Upstairs Bill Potter is giving the finishing touches to his hair and mustache, and "Pa" is having a frightful time trying to get near enough to a mirror to shave himself.The narrative races along without the least hesitation, and while one may regret that Potter is gullible enough to invest $4,000 in the then worthless oil stock, one is afterward highly gratified when the impressionable gentleman discovers that, after making what he thinks is a good bargain, he still is the owner of a share of stock that had completely slipped his mind.There are moments when "Pa" Potter is just the stenographer, and then there are his dreams of wealth. It is difficult for him as he figures out on paper that the stock will give him at least an income of $20,000 a day, to control his flexible physiognomy. Then he has his boastful periods, his gloomy instants, and others of unconfined joy.The adamant "Ma" Potter ships her husband back to the oil centre to force the return of the money for the stock "Pa" bought with enthusiasm. It happens, and quite reasonably, that "Pa" gets into a coach which has been uncoupled from the train. "Pa," who believes in making himself comfortable, goes to sleep and finds himself in the same place when he awakens.Miss Alden's portrayal of "Ma" Potter is another proof of her versatile talent. Ivy Harris is attractive and capable as the daughter. Richard "Skeets" Gallagher, rather overdoes the sartorial effects of "Red" Miller, but otherwise he is acceptable.The chief number on the surrounding program is "Opera versus Jazz." THE POTTERS, with W. C. Fields, Mary Alden, Ivy Harris, Jack Egan, Richard "Skeets" Galiagher, Joseph Smiley and Bradley Barker, adapted from J. P. McEvoy's play, directed by Fred Newmeyer; "Opera versus Jazz." At the Paramount Theatre.

544-> DEATH VALLEY' A FINE FILM.; Picture of the West at 55th St. Cinema -- College Tale at Hippodrome.
In a simple, powerful and dramatic manner, Paul Powell has pictured in "Death Valley," the new film at the Fifty-fifth Street Cinema this week, the story of a small group of prospectors in Death Valley in the American desert. Against this arid, desolate, seething background the director unfurls the love story of the "boy" and the "girl," the young man's efforts in search of gold, the attempt to steal it from him and finally the happy reconciliation.It is not much to work upon, but the director has made the story so integral a part of the locale that it would be entirely out of place in any other setting. One feels, as the picture progresses, that here are men and women who are entirely credible, struggling against a ruthless, relentless nature and not merely puppets in a picture doing the director's bidding. The picture moves along at precisely the lethargic pace that its atmosphere demands. You feel the utter hopelessness of the existence of these people, of the heat and the squalor that are slowly but inevitably grinding out their last powers of resistance.Not all of the scenes have been handled in an original manner, but there are a number that are powerfully gripping. In particular those sequences where Rex, a dog, tries to make his master understand that the "man" has stolen his gold, and the one where the "boy," fearing that the dog is crazed from the heat, draws his rifle from his sadle and turning his head fires at his companion, who, with a mute look of appeal and bewilderment, lifts one paw as if to ward off the discharge.The cast is uniformly excellent. DEATH VALLEY, with Carroll Nye, Rada Rae, Sam Allen, Raymond Wells, Grace Lord and Rex, by Raymond Wells, directed by Paul Powell. At the Fifty-fifth Street Cinema.

576-> A Roughhouse Comedy.
Whatever Mrs. Norris wrote in her novel, "The Callahans and the Murphys," at the Capitol this week, is a rough and tumble comedy that plays for loud laughs and occasional sentiment. Veering from the recent vogue of Irish-Jew burlesque, it is all-Irish and, as might be expected, full of fights and broad slapstick. It frankly makes no effort at the surprise style of screen entertainment. It is a smash-bang sort of thing all through, putting such properties as a flower-pot, a keg of beer, and a baby to proverbial uses—and, with those who have always liked such, hilarity results.The cast speaks for itself. Those who have followed stage and screen at all know Marie Dressler and Polly Moran. To them falls most of the work—and they work industriously at their mugging for comic effect and fighting for the fun of the thing. Of course, there is an Irish picnic, which in all cross-word puzzles definitions is the key for "mêlée"—and in this respect the picture is nothing if not orthodox."Let George Do It," a two-reel comedy of the conventional kind is also on the program and gets its share of laughs. THE CALLAHANS AND THE MURPHYS, with Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Sally O'Nell, Lawrence Gray, Frank Currier, Gertrude Olmstead and Eddie Gribbon, based on a novel by Kathleen Norris, titled by Ralph Spence, directed by George Hill: "Legend of Killarney," ballet corps and Chester Hale Girls.

648-> Nju."
It is not often that one has the pleasure of witnessing in the same film two such intelligent actors as Emil Jannings and Conrad Veidt. They are to be seen in "Husbands or Lovers," a German picture produced several years ago under the far more intriguing title of "Nju," which happens to be the innocent name of the woman to whom two fools make their prayer.This production reveals its age in its technical side, but the acting in it is far better than the average run of pictures of today and the story is unfurled without those artificial ideas that so often offend the eye. It was directed by Paul Czinner, who not only elicits natural actions and emotions from his players, but also sees to it that they are clad to suit the characters. Mr. Veidt, as the tall, slender man who fancies his friend's wife, wears trousers that are about an inch and a half above his shoe tops, while Jannings has a habit of running around his apartment with his suspenders hanging down. Jannings walks with deliberate steps, while the Lover in the story has a long, swift stride.No end of thought appears to have been given to some of the episodes in this production. You never for an instant behold a character being idle, even if it is merely an unimportant gesture. The thawing of anger into a laugh is especially well done. It happens when Jannings goes to see Veidt (there are no male character names). Jannings has a pistol in his pocket, but he is a coward. He decides to dissuade Veidt from calling on his wife. He does so, and the two men part in a friendly action. You then have one scene where Jannings is pondering at the door and another in which Veidt is weighing matters upstairs. It is splendidly done.Jannings reveals the husband's cowardice when he attacks his wife. She had declared her love for the tall, slender man. Jannings had been humble, pleading on his knees for Nju not to leave him. Her love for the slender young man is too strong, however, and so the lethargic husband is infuriated at hearing his wife speak of her affection for this other man.There are scenic limitations in this production, but the producer has done admirably in spite of the lack of up-to-date effects.Mr. Jannings in character is a little like he was in "Variety" except that here he is a man with a broken spirit, while as Stephen Huller he was a man of iron. He uses no make-up, except possibly a little greasepaint. Mr. veidt is also excellent as the intruder. In most Hollywood productions Mr. Veidt would have looked as if he had just stepped out of a bandbox. Here Mr. Veidt dresses his part without wondering whether his trousers are well pressed and if he has enough cuff showing. Elizabeth Bergner, who plays the wife, is a capital actress. On the screen she does not appear a raving beauty, and the fashions of other days hinder the effect of her interpretation. HUSBANDS OR LOVERS, with Emil Jannings, Conrad Veidt, Nils Edward, Migo Bard and others, a Rimax production, directed by Paul Czinner; overture, "Kamenoi-Ostrow;" "The Eternal Student;" No Blondes Allowed," with Charles King and Charles Dorety.

--------
693-> The Coal Miners.
A smudgy little coal-mining centre serves as the chief background for a maudlin pictorial subject, heralded as "White Flannels." It is an adaptation of a story by Lucian Cary and is concerned with a mother who virtually wants to keep her 20-year-old son tied to her apron strings; that is to say, she objects to his engagement to a local girl and, having married a coal miner, she is eager to have the young man go to college.The tearful incidents in this affair are set forth with a series of thumps, the intention apparently being that nothing shall escape any spectator's eye. Mrs. Jacob Politz, the mother, is frequently in a state of mental agony, and as the son is an upright, fine, young fellow, she appears to be making a mountain out of a mole hill.One of the high spots in this film is the dinner after the football game. Young Politz is the gridiron hero who saves the day for Strathmore University. Mrs. Politz not only goes to witness the game, but she gains entrance to the dining hall afterward as a waitress. Each time she thinks that her son might see her she conceals her face with a tray. And, of course, it is the campus flirt who scolds Mrs. Politz, with the result that Frank treats the girl in the same manner as this story has been handled—roughly.The inspiration for the title comes from the chapter in which Frank, wearing white flannel trousers, volunteers with others to go down the mine to the rescue of men caught in a cave-in.Louise Dresser is an exceptionally clever actress, but, as she has to live up to the director's instructions, her performance as the mother suffers. Jason Robards plays the son. He is quite sincere, but here again the director wants no mistake made about his being a hero on the football field and also in the mine. Virginia Browne Faire figures as the campus flirt.The Vitaphone features are far and away the most interesting part of the Colony program. First there is Herman Heller conducting a Vitaphone orchestra. This is followed by Sylvia Froos, who sings songs like "Where Did You Get Those Eyes?" and "I'm Telling the Birds." John Barclay is to be heard and seen (in shadow form) in three numbers. His voice is well reproduced, but there is a noticeable lisping in his renditions. Another Vitaphone subject is Roger Wolfe Kahn and his orchestra, which comes forth in sterling fashion. WHITE FLANNELS, with Louise Dresser, Jason Robards, Virginia Browne Faire, Warner Richmond, George Nichols, Brooks Benedict, Rose Blossom, Rosemary Cooper and others, adapted from a story by Lucian Cary, directed by Lloyd Bacon; overture, "Morning, Noon and Night"; Vitaphone features.

694-> EDISON AT EIGHTY.
Today the world does honor to EDISON on his eightieth birthday. In the annals of invention there is no figure like his. We must go back to LEONARDO to find a mind so technically imaginative.

803-> Messrs. Beery and Hatton.
After having had their fun in the army and navy, Wallace Beery and Raymond Hatton are now to be seen in another jarring comicality called "Fireman, Save My Child," in which they are ludicrous members of a fire department. Having fire, water and mud with which to deal, they are never at a loss for something that might be construed as fun. When they tire of playing with fire they resort to extracting mirth out of a dog, and the indefatigable Mr. Beery appears in one scene pretending to bite a dog, saying to the animal after he had done so:"Now, how do you like it?"This periodical explosive mirth brings to mind the old Yorkshire song which began:"Don't come down the ladder, Daddy,'Cause we've taken it away."Mr. Beery impersonates Elmer and Mr. Hatton appears as Sam. The latter in the first chapter is a rather imaginative crook, while Elmer is a thick-headed Scandinavian. The daughter of the Fire Commissioner is frequently eager to ask the firemen to help her with piano moving and other phases of household work. Her manner of calling on them is to turn in a fire alarm, and when the uniformed men appear it is usually Sam and Elmer who obey the wishes of the attractive Dora.Quite as much fun as any one could expect to get from the post by which the firemen slide from their beds to business, is filmed in this comedy. The big moment in this chapter comes when Captain Kennedy is giving a few tips to some other men. This is quite well done, for there is actually an element of suspense about the hectic scenes, particularly when the Captain decides to take the full distance from the cot floor to the ground floor and discovers to his discomfort that Sam and Elmer have taken a portion of the post away.You also have in this picture the rich episodes of Elmer and Sam jumping into what they believe to be only a puddle and then finding out that it is about ten feet deep. The Captain and others also take their turns at this muddy water.To say that Mr. Beery appears to find these comic activities more congenial than villainy is apparent from the evident enjoyment he gets out of the roaring episodes. His acting is clever, but it would be preferable to see him and his colleague, Mr. Hatton, in some contraption wherein they, as characters, were supposed to have just the slightest suspicion of gray matter. Mr. Hatton makes Sam just as stupid as Elmer, that is after Sam has snatched Elmer's $100 bill from him. FIREMAN, SAVE MY CHILD, with Wallace Beery, Raymond Hatton, Josephine Dunn, Tom Kennedy, Walter Goss and Joseph Girard, directed by Edward Sutherland, from a story by Monty Brice and Tom Geraghty; "Charles Gounod," one of the "Famous Music Master" series; "Row, Sailor, Row," a comedy.

1079-> The Chemist's Beauty Clay.
Although "Slaves of Beauty," the new pictorial offering at the Hippodrome, is a very uneven piece of work, both in direction and acting, it possesses an occasional glimmer of irony, which unfortunately has not been permitted to glow with any great strength. J. G. Blystone, the director, is not wholly responsible for extinguishing this interesting spark, for it is obvious that he was guided by a scenario in which the commercial angle or that of popular appeal had by no means been ignored.This film is moderately diverting, what with its beauty parlor scenes, the flashes of adipose ladies who are joyful at losing mere ounces and the idea of having a hard-working chemist utterly careless about his own personal appearance so long as his discovery of a rejuvenating clay mixture is successful.The picture is based on a story by Nina Wilcox Putnam, who appears to be entitled to the giant's share of the credit for the worthy bits. It is a narrative that is refreshing, even in its present form, after some of the hodge-podge that comes to the screen.In an early chapter, the chemist is anything but hero to his wife. He is, as a matter of fact, a nuisance, because of noisome odors that emanate from his laboratory drive away Anastasia Jones's customers. When by accident he realizes that he has discovered a beautifying clay, he becomes persona grata in his own home. But only for a time, for Anastasia, when presiding over her Fifth Avenue beauty shop, determines that her husband's dilapidated appearance shocks her patrons. Anastasia, herself, improves her looks by her husband's clay, and regular flattery from an obsequious and somewhat effeminate manager of the shop has the effect of causing this ungrateful creature to want to divorce her husband.The chemist, Leonard Jones, has his day, and it is on the last morning of this film. The outcome teaches Anastasia the lesson she needed. The effeminate manager finds himself forced to go to a rival beauty establishment because he has a black eye, which was given to him quite neatly by Anastasia's daughter's young man. No other than Anastasia's husband presides over the rival beauty shop, and when he has become reconciled to his wife, he chances to observe Paul Terry, the effeminate manager, having his eye doctored. Mr. Jones enters the cubicle quickly, and when Paul declines to protect himself, Anastasia's husband believes that he at least has the privilege of blackening Paul's other eye. Hence Paul leaves the picture with two lovely black eyes.Holmes Heroert is admirable as the chemist. Olive Tell is quite good in most of the sequences. Paul Terry is played by Earle Foxe, who depends a little too much upon his eyebrows in acting. The other players are only fair. SLAVES OF BEAUTY, with Holmes Herbert, Olive Tell, Earle Foxe, Margaret Livingston, Richard Walling, Sue Carol and Mary Foy, based on a story by Nina Wilcox Putnam, directed by J. G. Blystone; "A Dog's Diary," an "Aesop Fable"; vaudeville acts. At the Hippodrome.
