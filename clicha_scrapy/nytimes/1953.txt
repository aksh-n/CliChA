415-> ' Eight Iron Men,' Drama About American Soldiers in Italy, Arrives at the Globe
Although a great deal of shooting occurs in "Eight Iron Men," the Stanley Kramer war drama that arrived at the Globe yesterday, it would be not only painful but wholly misleading to say that a brand new year of movies has opened with a bang. This film, from "A Sound of Hunting," which was a play by Harry Brown, done in 1945 on Broadway, is a dismally meretricious thing, half of it smoldering dugout drama and the other half cheesecake burlesque.For long stretches in this picture, nothing much occurs outside of some brassy conversation among assorted members of a tattered platoon, of weary American soldiers holed up in the ruins of an Italian town. And much of this conversation has rather tediously to do with the problem of rescuing a comrade pinned down by an enemy machine gun in a shell hole out in a street of the town.While the story is swinging in this circuit, there is a lot of loud and angry talk among men who have differences of opinion and have got on one another's nerves. Some are for doing the job quickly, some are for taking their time and some, as the picture continues, are for letting the whole project drop.But, every so often, the story swings away from such solemn talk to other talk about food, regulations, furlough, home and dames. And when it is in this circuit, the jesting is bawdy and broad, offering very strong reason for suspecting that it is precociously contrived. There are even a couple of sequences, supposed to be reveries or dreams, which are generously populated by beautiful women in scanty costumes.Towards the end, the one soldier in the dugout who has done most of the talking about dames and has given the clear impression that he is the most deliberate goof, casually picks up his equipment, goes out in the street alone and methodically knocks off the machine gun that no one else has been able to touch. Then it is found that the pinned-down comrade has been comfortably dozing all the time.This little touch of anti-climax, presumably meant as irony, was not in the play and it adds nothing to the very meager qualities of the film. These include dialogue that is racy and generally picturesque, without being trenchant or revealing, and several vigorous acting jobs. Bonar Colleano, as the noisiest of the platoon—the one who's always talking about dames—and Lee Marvin, as a hard-boiled sergeant, turn in the best of the lot. Nick Dennis, as a dialectician, and James Griffith, as a dour Bill Mauldin type, handle the second-fiddle humor, while Richard Kiley plays a nerve-wracked soldier well.However, the effort is futile. Mr. Brown's war-worn play, adapted by him for this project, comes off a crass and pointless film. EIGHT IRON MEN, screen play by Harry Brown, based on his own play.

1136-> At Loew's State
In "Torch Song," which arrived yesterday at Loew's State, Joan Crawford's obvious charms are enhanced by Technicolor, and she wears a profusion of gowns and accessories likely to dazzle designers and debutantes while singing and dancing the numbers of a bulging musical comedy book. Miss Crawford, it is only fair to state, never looked lovelier, and it might be indicated also that "Torch Song" is not precisely a bright new kind of story. Miss Crawford's desperate need for love is the essence of the drama here, a film problem, it would appear, that she has encountered before.The lady is, in this case, a Broadway star who arrived at her zenith the hard way and is ruthless in maintaining that position during rehearsals of a new show to the extent of giving her associates, backstage and elsewhere, assorted megrims.At this point, however, Michael Wilding, a blind pianist, arrives on the scene as her arranger-accompanist to replace a predecessor who has been forced to flee her tantrums. The versatile Mr. Wilding, a drama critics before the war in which he lost his sight, also is secretly in love with Miss Crawford and, as a philosopher and psychologist of sorts, is a great hand at needling his lady fair. She finally responds by recognizing that she not only loves but needs him.It should be pointed out that the aforementioned essentials do not include some sparkling, contemporary lines contributed by John Michael Hayes and Jan Lustig, the scenarists, as well as good renditions of the Jack Lawrence-Walter Gross tune, "Tenderly"; the Kermit Goell-Fred Spielman number titled "You Won't Forget Me" and a production song and dance scene featuring "Two Faced Woman" by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz.Michael Wilding is restrained but fairly effective as the pianist; Gig Young, Marjorie Rambeau, Henry Morgan and Dorothy Patrick are competent as Miss Crawford's boy friend, mother, stage manager and rival, respectively. But it is Miss Crawford's show and she plays it to the hilt justifiably, displaying her legs in a turn or two and a respectable amount of emotion to project both her tough but beautiful exterior and the essentially soft lovesick woman underneath it. However, despite its glitter and polish, her "Torch Song" is strangely familiar. TORCH SONG, screen play by John Michael Hayes and Jan Lustig; based on a story by I. A. R.

1154-> THE SCREEN; At the Art Theatre
A program featuring a revival of "Congress Dances" at the Art Theatre yesterday was supplemented with a puppet featurette from Germany, "The Seven Ravens." Produced in 1947 in the American zone by an enterprising outfit called Diehl Brothers, with English dialogue added, this significantly black-and-white offering is ideally suited for children. Provided, we suspect, that the youngsters don't demand the splendor of a Czech predecessor, "The Emperor's Nightingale."Competence, rather than poetical imagination, marks most of the footage, which runs for nearly an hour. This Grimm fairy tale of a pastoral maiden whose brave seven-year silence restores her seven brothers to human form is pantomimed amid tastefully miniature forests, villages and palace interiors. Except for the princely hero, who suggests an idiot out of Cocteau, the tiny thespians are quite fetching to behold.Furthermore, their manipulation is admirably lifelike and adroit. However, the nimble photography saves the day, surmounting the generally slack editing, defining the pace and prodding this minor but perfectly respectable little endeavor toward the big league. It points, at least, in the right direction. At the Art Theatre THE SEVEN RAVENS, an M & A Alexander Productions, Inc., release, adapted from the Grimm fairy tale; photographed by Alfonse Lufteck, produced by Diehl Brothers and distributed here by Noel Meadow.

1177-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Martin and Lewis Go Dramatic in 'The Stooge,' Which Bows at Paramount Theatre
Here is some information that is likely to shatter your faith in man: Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis have gone dramatic in their current film. "The Stooge," which put in an appearance at the Paramount yesterday after languishing for almost two years in Hal Wallis' studio vaults, has the two rambunctious comedians playing characters in a sentimental plot and actually pawing at the heart-strings before it comes to an end. Students of the exotic and the brazenly bizarre are likely to find the display more intriguing than will the addicts of straight belly-laughs.To be sure, the script, put together by Martin Rackin and Fred F. Finklehoff from a story contrived by the latter and Sid Silvers, who was once a stooge himself, makes plenty of room for the playmates to crack jokes and clown around in the manner to which their fanatics have become accustomed. Mr. Lewis, enrolled as a Brooklyn bumpkin who amiably strings along as the unbilled foil for a vaudeville performer with an over-abundance of conceit, does plenty of things that are comic. In his old familiar slapstick style he wrestles with the plumbing in a Pullman and gets foolishly tipsy on champagne. And Mr. Martin, as the puffed up performer who owes his success to his self-effacing stooge, comes back, of course, with the wisecracks and frequently hauls off and sings.This is moderately funny or silly, according to how one responds to the frenetic brand of entertainment dished up by these two outgoing boys. Most stirring, whichever way you take it, is one sequence in which Jerry is forced to sing a song number ("I'm Yours") before a theatre audience, with the key being raised on each bar. (You don't think that very funny? All right, you at least must agree that Mr. Lewis is a comedian who will gallantly try anything.)But evident from the beginning is this rather surprising thing of having Mr. Martin and Mr. Lewis play reasonably human characters—Mr. Martin an unpleasant swelled-head and Mr. Lewis a sweet-natured dunce. And as the thing progresses, it is evident more and more that they are headed for a showdown in a burst of sentiment. Sure enough, it happens, with the performing teammates busting up over the classic matter of billing and then coming back together again when Mr. Martin flops as a "single" and Mr. Lewis rushes to his rescue from out of the audience.There is also a wife for Mr. Martin, whom Polly Bergen nicely plays, and an agent, performed by Eddie Mayehoff, whom he makes very droll and honorable.Now, we don't want to take the position that Mr. Martin and Mr. Lewis could not play a straight dramatic show, if they wanted—even "Hamlet," to mention the extreme. But the mixture of slapstick and sentiment that is tossed off in "The Stooge" is a little bewildering for them, not to mention their customers. The going gets rather sticky and unfunny toward the end. This is not only oddly depressing; it is perilous to one's simple faith in man. THE STOOGE, screen play by Fred F. Finklehoff and Martin Rackin, from a story by Mr. Finklehoff and Sid Silver; directed by Norman Taurog; produced by Hal B. Wallis. A Hal Wallis Production released by Paramount Pictures.
