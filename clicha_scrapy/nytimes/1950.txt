9-> THE SCREEN; Apologies to Puccini
Since Puccini's bittersweet musical ode to the Bohemian life needs no evaluation here, let it be said at the outset that the passages from "La Boheme," as recorded in "Her Wonderful Lie," seem to maintain their classic stature. As for the story of this modern adaptation of the opera, which came to the Little Carnegie, on Saturday, the less said the better. The sufferings of the garret artists are very often no greater than those besetting a viewer. There is an obvious attempt by the producers to avoid the pitfalls of photographing a static opera set by paralleling the affair of a latter day pair of Parisian singers with the tragic romance of Mimi and Rodolfo. But it is a stiff, sometimes maudlin and often boring business hardly worth all the effort.Columbia exported to Rome a company of willing hands, including Janis Carter, who plays the model confidante of the hapless heroine; Marc Platt, Gil Lamb and Sterling Holloway, as the artist friends of René (Rodolfo); Franklin Pangborn; John Abbott, as a conductor, and Douglass Dumbrille, as the heroine's rich suitor. Aside from the fact that they had the unusual distinction of doing their chores in English in Italy for an American film, it is hard to see why their trip was necessary.As Reneé Lamertin, a Polish singer who freezes in a Left Bank seventh-floor walk-up until his girl friend gets him his opera opportunity, Jan Kiepura is a wooden figure given to posturing and sudden outbursts. Marta Eggerth is pretty, blonde and sings a few of the airs, including the deathbed aria, pleasingly as the ill fated Jeanette, who, dying of consumption, lies wonderfully in denying her love to René. "Her exit came too early," says one of the principals when that pale lady expires. That can be listed as a debatable opinion. Apologies to PucciniHER WONDERFUL LIE, screen play by Ernst Marischka, Hamilton Benz and Rowland Leigh; from a story by Mr. Marischka and Gustave Holm; based on Henri Murger's novel. "Latin Quarter" with music from Giacomo Puccini's opera, "La Boheme"; directed by Carmine Gallone; a Cineopera production presented by Columbia. At the Little Carnegie.Denise Vernier . . . . .

273-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; 'World Youth Festival,' New Soviet Documentary With Narration in English, Opens at Stanley
Since the Russians are not adverse to recording practically every event occurring in the macrocosm surrounding Moscow, it is not surprising that a corps of cameramen was set loose to perpetuate last year's congress of youth in Budapest.Photographed in the pleasing pastel shades of what the Soviet film makers term "Magicolor," "World Youth Festival," the 55-minute documentary which arrived at the Stanley on Saturday, concentrates, oddly enough, on the lively arts and sports. And, though the achievements of Soviet youth dominate the proceedings, propaganda, as voiced by the English-speaking narrator, is kept in a minor key.With reportedly 10,000 delegates representing eighty nations as the nucleus for the 250,000 persons who took part in the festival, cameras caught a wealth of color in costumes, including Mongolian, African, Bulgarian, Norwegian, Chinese, Indo-Chinese and the varied dress of the more exotic peoples of the U. S. S. R.Highlighted are folk songs and dances of the young Czech, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Polish, Indo-Chinese and Russian artists who attended, as well as the track and field, swimming, bicycle and wrestling stars from Mongolia who participated in the meeting.But its great store of performers and its intermittent reminders that "youth is ready to fight for peace" are not precisely attributes. "World Youth Festival," despite its array of fervent and accomplished thousands, is an uneven and fairly placid report emphasizing little beyond the fact that youth, beauty and talent are international.Although "World Youth Festival" heads the Stanley's bill, "The Story of a Ring," a featurette produced by the Moscow Popular Science Studio, has far greater impact both as pure cinema and as extraordinary subject matter. A charming pastoral dealing with the life-cycle of the stork, it makes what might have been a dry, unpalatable educational film into a sensitive, restrained and moving case history.Also included on the all-documentary program are "The Urals," a color subject on the industrializatin of cities in that mountainous zation of cities in that mountainous area; a color travelogue on Batum and a news report on Peking.

279-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; 'If This Be Sin,' With Myrna Loy and Roger Livesey, Is New Feature at Rivoli
Some pretty good acting talent and some obviously expensive British sets, as well as some beautiful scenery on the Island of Capri, have been expended by Gregory Ratoff in his new film, "If This Be Sin," to the demonstration of a thesis that is as old and bewhiskered as the pard. This thesis, displayed through the behavior of a British barrister who distrusts his wife and causes a minor family turmoil, is that there are none so blind as those who will not see.The sightless in this exposition, which went on at the Rivoli yesterday, are virtually everybody of major importance in the tale. First, there is the lawyer, whom Roger Livesey plays; he can't see that he has neglected his long-suffering wife, Myrna Loy, and that by his neglect he has thrown her into the arms of Richard Greene. And then he can't see her nobility when she generously passes Mr. Greene along to their marriageable daughter, Peggy Cummins, in the hope of avoiding a scene.As for the daughter, Miss Cummins, she can't see very well herself, having trouble perceiving the greatness of her mother's generosity, when she finds out. The mother, too, seems a little walleyed and near-sighted, at times, while Mr. Greene looks to be a fellow whose eyes are shut and who just goes where he is told.With so many unperceptive people knocking about in this film, it's no wonder that a great deal of groping and wandering off blindly is done. The whole picture ambulates slowly, talks a lot and says nothing at all. It could be, of course, that the author of the screen play was also slightly blind.And since we are on the subject, let's admit that we have trouble seeing, too. We have trouble seeing why a picture as flat as this one was ever produced. IF THIS BE SIN, screen play by Gene Markey, from the play, "Autumn," by Margaret Kennedy and Ilya Surgutchoff; directed and produced by Gregory Ratoff, and released through United Artists.

527-> THE SCREEN: FOUR NEWCOMERS ON LOCAL SCENE; 'The Men,' Film on Paraplegic Veterans, at the Music Hall-- Marlon Brando in Lead Roxy Shows Story of Indians, 'Broken Arrow'--Premieres at Capital and Palace At the Roxy At the Capitol At the Palace
A fine and arresting film drama about paraplegic veterans of the war—about men whose battle injuries have left them paralyzed below the waist—has been brought to the screen by Stanley Kramer in his independent production, "The Men," which was fittingly presented at the Music Hall yesterday. And a trenchant and stinging performance as one of these disabled men who struggles against his bleak frustrations toward a calm readjustment to life is given in it by Marion Brando, making his screen debut after his notable Broadway triumph in "A Streetcar Named Desire."Much has been lucidly written about the paraplegic vets, numbering some 2,500, who are residuals of the war. And much has been done to place them normally in the public's inquisitive eye. Sports events in which paraplegics in their wheel-chairs have played normal teams have been held to accustom the public to the capacities of these "immobilized" men, and in many other ways their abilities as participants in society have been revealed. But nothing yet demonstrated has so fully realized and portrayed—at least, to the public's comprehension—the inner torments, the despairs, the loneliness and the possible triumphs of a paraplegic as this picture does.In a firm, forthright, realistic study of a group of paralyzed men, and especially of one young fellow who seems more stubborn and frustrated than the rest, Mr. Kramer and his associates have tactfully but frankly exposed the bitter and ironic aspects of being paralyzed below the waist. They have caught the raw human anguish of bed-ridden and wheel-chair-saddled men, the tensions and friendships and grim humors of a paraplegic hospital ward. And in tracing the course of a stark romance between their hero and a loyal, noble girl they have got a moving comprehension of the confused feelings of a paraplegic's wife.Much of this picture was photographed and practically all of it was derived at the Birmingham Veterans Hospital near Los Angeles. Here Producer Kramer and Scriptwriter Carl Foreman lived for several weeks, and here Director Fred Zinneman recruited some of the minor players in his cast. So there is no wonder that a striking and authentic documentary quality has been imparted to the whole film in every detail, attitude and word.But the major accomplishment of these artists is the simplicity and eloquence with which they have shown the fundamental conflicts in a paraplegic's readjustment to life—the terrible, pathetic reluctance to give up hoping for a "return" and the forcing of the head to take over the life of the dead immobile legs. And in these demonstrations they have coincidently achieved an understanding of doctors, nurses, parents, sweet-hearts and wives.Mr. Brando as the veteran who endures the most difficult time is so vividly real, dynamic and sensitive that his illusion is complete. His face, the whole rhythm of his body and especially the strange timbre of his voice, often broken and plaintive and boyish, are articulate in every way. Out of stiff and frozen silences he can lash into a passionate rage with the fearful and flailing frenzy of a taut cable suddenly cut. Or he can show the poignant tenderness of doctor with a child.Excellent, too, are Richard Erdman, Arthur Jurado and Jack Webb as three varied paraplegics, each a full, rich character in himself, and especially Everett Sloane as the doctor who understands, cajoles, badgers and leads the men. And Teresa Wright, while a mite too wistful and whispy as the girl in the case, conveys the essential compassion and solidity that is necessary to the role.Stern in its intimations of the terrible consequences of war, this film is a haunting and affecting, as well as a rewarding, drama to have at this time.On the stage at the Music Hall are June Winters, Mark Dawson, Sing Lee Sing, Nip Nelson, Rickey Holden, the Corps de Ballet, Glee Club and Rockettes.

Marguerite MartinIn what appears an honorable endeavor to clear the public's mind of the traditional notion that the American Indian was an unprincipled and uncivilized brute, Twentieth Century-Fox has manufactured a richly colorful romantic film, "Broken Arrow," in which the Indians come off better—much better—on the whole, than do the whites. As a matter of fact, one might wonder from this exhibit, now on the Roxy's screen, whether it isn't the white man, not the Indian, who should be regarded as "good" only when he is dead.For here, in this high-minded story of a lanky veteran of the Civil War who tries to make peace between the white men and the Chiricahua Apache tribe of the great Southwest, It is the Indian chief, Cochise, who shows vision and noble character, and it is a group of snarling citizens of Tucson who show blind bigotry and ruthless hate. To be sure, there are also some good white men and some bad Indians—to wit, Geronimo, who refuses to bury the hatchet, to break the arrow—but, by and large, that's how it is.We wish we could tell you unreservedly that the thesis is eloquently conveyed and that this picture demonstrates with real conviction that the Indian has been cruelly maligned. But unfortunately the nobleness of purpose of Twentieth Century-Fox is more to be commended than the talent with which it has made this film.Oh, yes—there are many resonant speeches and protestations of Christian virtue and brotherly love in the script which Michael Blank-fort derived from Elliott Arnold's novel, "Blood Brother." The scenery is mighty pretty—in Technicolor, of course—and there are two or three rather juicy re-enactments of ambuscades, one by some white men on the Indians being as rough as anything the latter pull.But apparently in his enthusiasm to treat the Indian with politeness and respect, Delmer Daves, the director, brought forth red men who act like denizens of the musical comedy stage. Jeff Chandler, who plays Cochise, is twice as clean and stalwart-looking as James Stewart, who plays the drawling prospector by whom the peaceful mission is embarked. Mr. Chandler carries himself with the magnificence of a decathalon champion at the Olympic Games and speaks with the round and studied phrasing of the salutatorian of a graduating class.By comparison, Mr. Stewart is a human specimen of miserable account. He fumbles his words, waves his hands in lazy gestures and throws his whole enterprise on a casual plane. This is all the more disconcerting when he is supposed to fall beautifully in love with a China-doll Indian maiden, whom Debra Paget rhapsodically plays. The scenes of the gitchy-goo love-making between these two by the waters of a lake (could be Minnetonka) are downright embarrassing. And the well-ordered tribal ceremony by which the two love-birds are wed is as clean and starched and artificial as a most elaborate high-church affair.It is notable, however, that the producers do not permit the miscegenation to exist long. The bride is slain accidentally by some viciously maurauding whites.No, we cannot accept this picture as either an exciting or reasonable account of the attitudes and ways of American Indians. They merit justice, but not such patronage.On the stage at the Roxy are the Andrews Sisters, Phil Romayne and Terry Brent and an ice revue, featuring Carol Lynne, Boy Foy and the Skating Blades and Belles.

Chris Willow BirdMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which has used noted vacation oasis as movie backgrounds before, now has discovered Sun Valley as a back-drop for "Duchess of Idaho," which arrived at the Capitol yesterday. The discovery is something less than monumental. For in this romantic comedy in which Esther Williams is abetted by handsome men, beautiful women and equally beautiful swimming pools and snowy slopes suitable for skiing, there is proof that a venerable formula has not been ignored. The principals, as well as their surroundings, never looked lovelier than they do in the panchromatic hues of Technicolor and the story is routine and often painfully obvious. The company, in effect, never left home.Precisely what sort of verve and gaiety the scenarists had in mind is hard to determine from the proceedings. In this case, Miss Williams is cast, naturally enough, as a swimming star who seeks to help her roommate, a secretary to a playboy-financier, snare that elusive gent. However, early in the scheming, Miss Williams loses her heart to band leader Van Johnson. Neither Mr. Johnson nor John Lund, as the dame-chasing tycoon, can understand the plot hatched by the lovely mermaid and it is only after a lengthy series of misunderstandings and partings that the ladies catch the lads they really had their eyes on.Of course, Miss Williams gets opportunities to display her aquatic talents in two opulent production numbers complete with fountains and a squadron of heroic natators. And, it must be noted, that she also handles her dialogue naturally. Paula Raymond, as her lovesick roommate, is a striking brunette who seems convincing as she moans, "I'm always engaged—never a bride—I must be using the wrong soap." Lena Home makes a brief appearance to sing "Baby, Come Out of the Clouds"; Eleanor Powell contributes a tap routine to a boogie-woogie number to prove her talent should be kept before the cameras, and Red Skelton adds an unbilled bit to complete the film's roster of guest stars.Van Johnson is lackadaisical as the baffled baton-waver who also sings one of the picture's tunes; none of which, incidentally, could be termed distinguished. And, John Lund's portrayal of the predatory playboy can be listed as casual too. "Women," he says complaining about his involvement, "always have to have a plot." "Duchess of Idaho" also could use one.Featured on the stage of the Capitol are Bert Wheeler, Sid Slate, Toni Arden, Stan Fisher, Lou Wills, Jr., Sherry Shadburne and Sonny Dunham and his orchestra.

The crowd at the Palace yesterday, obviously in no mood for the heat or the Korean conflict, ate it up.Diana Lynn, in the title role, has a real All-American problem. Should she tell Father, played by Charles Coburn, that she's secretly wed to that fullback at Ohio State, the one he hates so much? If she does, against the advice of her older sister, Barbara Lawrence, he'll annul it. Or should she play it single and compete with the other Pasadena girls for Queen of the Rose Tournament? Miss Lynn nearly blows her pretty top when her husband's team turns up at the Bowl and she's crowned to boot. But Coburn forgives her, Miss Lawrence steps in as the rose regina, and Coburn is nabbed by the aggressive widow next door, played by Charlotte Greenwood and the brightest thing in the picture.Transparent though these goings-on are, Director Frederick de Cordova has seen to it that they don't lag, and the behind-the-scenes peeps at the Festival preparations, together with an actual newsreel coverage of the parade, are quite diverting. So are the performances, even if Mr. Coburn is inclined to snort and bellow. Miss Lynn is elfin and natural, likewise the more willowy Miss Lawrence; Rock Hudson and Charles Drake, their partners, score neatly. And Connie Gilchrist is triumphant in a bit role as a rakish nurse. Anyone who scowls at such nice people should be made to sit through "Peggy" twice. At the PalacePEGGY, screen play by George F.

543-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; 'Good Time Girl,' British-Made Case History of a Delinquent, Starring Jean Kent, Opens at Globe The Cast
The English, who do not regard delinquency or sin lightly, are giving these aspects of living a once-over heavily in "Good Time Girl," the British-made import which arrived at the Globe on Saturday. Hardly new in concept or sparkling in execution, this film commentary on one facet of the postwar London scene has been illustrated before and with better results. The case history of Gwen Rawlings and her determined but ill-fated effort to escape her slum background the easy way is an obvious, dreary and drawn-out business not enhanced by a commonplace story of the few genuinely solid portrayals it boasts.The fact of the matter is that Muriel and Sydney Box and Ted Willis, the scenarists, and David MacDonald, the director, have leaned—awkwardly in most instances—on transparent and largely unconvincing melodramatic devices to spin their doleful tale. Gwen Rawlings' case is, to quote the script, as much the result of "bad luck" and coincidence as it is "bad companions" and "bad up-bringing." Her doom is sealed from the start as she is nabbed attempting to steal a brooch. Escape from the beatings of her father to a sleazy night club brings no uplift but a set of unsavory characters one of whom gets multilated, a crime for which our innocent "moth" gets "burned" to the tune of a three-year stretch in an "approved school."The hardened young women of this correctional institution teach our willing newcomer a few new tricks and our errant sybarite, breaking away from this environment, returns to London and a playboy companion. Imbibing too freely, she kills a man in an auto accident and, fleeing from this horror, she becomes involved with a couple of American soldiers, who have deserted. This trio's short but fast round of robberies finally ends with—you guessed it—murder. And, it also ends, at long last, Miss Rawlings' sad saga.As the hapless teen-ager, Jean Kent is an appealing, pretty and competent actress who handles her lines easily and professionally. Flora Robson makes a couple of brief appearances as a jurist who tells the story to save another girl from the fate of Gwen Rawlings. Herbert Lom, as the mutilated boite owner; Dennis Price, as a jazz pianist who befriends Miss Kent, and Griffith Jones, as the playboy, give her sturdy support. But it should be noted that the British have given us a more convincing view of delinquency and approved schools in "Children on Trial," released here some three years ago. And, it might also be noted that even the commendable acting in "Good Time Girl" does not bring it out of the minor melodrama class.

590-> THE SCREEN: ADVENTURE THEME IN NEW FILMS; Burt Lancaster Plays the Old Swashbuckler in 'Flame and Arrow,' of Strand Theatre 'Where the Sidewalk Ends,' Fox Picture With Dana Andrews, Arrives at the Roxy At the Roxy
Who says that the fire of bold adventure is dying on the screen? Who says that there is no longer interest in flashing romance and deering-do? Shades of Douglas Fairbanks (the ???lder) and Errol Flynn! Take a look at Burt Lancaster and his new film, "The Flame and the Arrow!" Take a look at this gaudy swashbuckler, the arrival yesterday the Strand, and then answer those arch interrogations with a crisp and sardonic "Ha!"For not since Mr. Fairbanks was leaping from castle walls and vaulting over the rooftops of ancient story-book towns has the screen had such a reckless and acrobatic young man to display these same inclinations as it has in Mr. L. Not even Mr. Flynn, the dauntless, in the happy days of his youth, when he (or his energetic double) was swinging elastically from ropes or the trees of Sherwood Forest, could match gymnastics with him. And not since—well, we can't remember—have the movies had such an allout spread of luxuriously romantic hokum as they have in this Technicolored film.They tell us that Mr. Lancaster, who previously has made himself known as a player of cold, laconic gunmen, was an acrobat in his youth and that his nature is only unfettered when he is firmly attached to a trapeze. This is not hard to credit, once you see him perform as a twelfth-century brigand of high spirit and athletic prowess in this film. With a brilliance matched only by the dazzle of his gleaming white teeth when he smiles, he hoists himself up to the tops of houses, leaps onto castle balconies, glides down the folds of great cloth hangings and swings from chandeliers. He rides like the wind on horses, shoots like a fool with bow and arrow and battles hordes of spearmen with blazing torches in his hands.Indeed, he is so exuberant of and by himself that one might be misled into giving him full credit for the vigor of this film. But the simple fact is that the screen play, prepared by Waldo Salt, is a rich and alive accumulation of swashy adventure episodes, and Jacques Tourneur has staged it with his hand on the throttle and his tongue in his cheek. It isn't so much the story, which is one of those rampant affairs about a good-natured peasant outlaw—in this case, in northern Italy—opposing a ruthless tyrant who would bind and enslave the land. Taken simply as a story, it falls all over itself. The important thing is the rush of incident that flows through the picture unchecked and the gay, uninhibited spirit of roughhouse in which it is played.Not only does Mr. Lancaster give it the old sweep and swing, but everyone else plays it madly—even the lady-like dames. Nick Cravat, who (we're told) was the partner of Mr. Lancaster in his carnival days, h???re???abets ??? in wild acrobatics as his mute and comical friend. Frank Allenby and Robert Douglas are amusingly wicked in turn, and Virginia Mayo portrays the beauteous maiden—the inevitable beauteous maiden—with élan.When they all get involved, helter-skelter, with a troupe of medieval acrobats (right out of a modern circus) in the castle's expansive great hall, for the slambang and heave-ho finale, in which everyone gets clonked on the head, you might think you were back with Mr. Fairbanks (cum Buster Keaton). Who says that derring-do is dead?On the stage at the Strand are Jane Pickens, Florian Zabach, Laurette and Clyman and B???uddy Lester and his band. THE FLAME AND THE ARROW, screen play by Waldo Salt; directed by Jacques Tourneur; produced by Harold Hecht and Frank Ross and released by Warner Brothers. At the Strand.Dardo . . . . .

Robin HughesAt the RoxyTwentieth Century-Fox, which has turned out quite a few superior cops-and-robbers films within the last couple of years, deposited still another better-than-average one at the Roxy yesterday. It is called "Where the Sidewalk Ends," with Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney heading the cast.This graphically-presented account of a sadistic detective who accidentally kills a man and tries to pin it on a slippery public enemy doesn't have the over-all trigger tension of "Kiss of Death" or the picturesqueness of "Cry of the City." And the plausibility of the script by Ben Hecht, an old hand with station houses and sleazy underworldlings, is open to question on several counts. Not so, however, his pungent dialogue and unfolding of the plot, which Otto Preminger, who guided the same stars through "Laura" several seasons back, has taken to like a duck to water and kept clipping along crisply till the fadeout.Mr. Andrews is on the spot, and a spot it is. With a killer father in his past and constantly in the police departmental doghouse for banging the citizenry around, he fatally floors a fugitive with a lead plate in his head, a fine war record and some newspaper friends. His frenzied camouflaging is meant to point the finger at an ancient gangster foe but instead victimizes an innocent cab driver, Miss Tierney's father. The showdown, a shoot-'em-up corralling of the gangsters in a huge garage, accidentally clears Mr. Andrews, and he's the white-haired boy at headquarters. And, of course, Miss Tierney is all ready and waiting. But Mr. Andrews decides to spill the beans and marches off under arrest. Mr. Hecht, take a deep bow!The most winning things in the picture are the minor characterizations: Tom Tully as the cabbie, Ruth Donnelly as a tart-tongued hash-slinger, Bert Freed as Mr. Andrews' disapproving pal. Gary Merrill, as the intended victim, is one of the most convincing gangsters since Scarface. Mr. Preminger's megaphoning and some expert photography have resulted in a most vivid blend of action and New York City backgrounds.Miss Tierney is lovely, as usual, and even works up a little animation for a change. But it must be said that Mr. Andrews, who bears the brunt of the picture, performs more intelligently than convincingly. Even with a bulldog mouth, he looks much too level-headed to be a natural-born sadist. Again, it is doubtful if a man of his supposed calibre would give himself up to justice so valiantly. But the real eyebrow-raiser is the scene where the boys at the station house swoop down like triumphant hawks on the naive, open-faced cabbie.Fox may not have plumbed the depths of realism this time, but it still looks interesting, even two-thirds of the way down.The Roxy stage is presenting an ice revue, "The Merry Widow," and Vivian Blaine and Will Mahoney.

677-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Cagney Sparkles in Warners' Musical, 'The West Point Story,' at the Strand
If everything about "The West Point Story" were anywhere near as good as Jimmy Cagney is in it, this Warner musical show, which trooped yesterday onto the Strand's screen, would be the top musical of the year. For the estimable Mr. Cagney is in rare good form in this film, singing, dancing and wisecracking in his most electrifying style and putting on a show of braggadocio that makes one tingle with gleeful delight.As a hot-tempered Broadway hoofer who reluctantly takes on a job of coaching and generally directing the annual West Point cadet show, Mr. Cagney struts brazenly and brashly through a rah-rah-Army romantic script which bears a striking resemblance to those of several previous West Point films. He barks at the embryo generals because he has a strong distaste for "brass," he tries to change the rules of the academy and he makes things exciting all around. Finally, to prove he has the gumption, he endeavors to live the life of a cadet—which, of course, is slightly fantastic but is good for ordinary laughs. And he does an odd job of playing cupid which might better be overlooked.But what he does best is play the wise-guy, the strictly from Broadway kid, and knock off a couple of numbers that have vitality to burn. With the beautifully shaped Virginia Mayo as his professional associate and patient girl, he does some athletic dancing routines to a tune naturally tagged "The Wishing Rock." And, likewise with beauteous Miss Mayo and a whole gang of chorus boys, he whips out an impudent fandango called "Brooklyn," which lauds that pulsing borough.The measure of Mr. Cagney's impact upon the whole tenuous show is patently indicated when he is not on the screen. For then the thing sags in woeful fashion, the romance becomes absurd and the patriotic chest-thumping becomes so much chorus-boy parade. And this is despite some vigorous punching on the part of a bright young thing named Doris Day and some very sincere and manly acting from handsome Gordon MacRae. Miss Day has a cheerful personality. She sings a song trippingly, especially a novelty number by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn, "Ten Thousand Sheep." And Mr. MacRae stands up boldly as a style-cut musical juvenile.Also, Gene Nelson is a dancer who cuts some high-stepping capers as a cadet and Alan Hale Jr. bulges coyly as overweight comedy relief.However, the show is Mr. Cagney's—as much as there is of it. And he makes it twirl like a baton when he has it in his veteran hands.On the stage at the strand are Jackie Miles, Raye and Naldi, Don Cornell, Martin and Florenz and Florian Zabach and the band.

682-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Howard Duff Plays a Crooked Camera Man in 'Shakedown' at Criterion Theatre
One of the season's most thorough-going heels holds the spotlight in "Shakedown." This melodrama from Universal-International, which arrived at the Criterion on the week-end, is somewhat longer on talk than action, but there is enough of the latter to go around the eighty minutes that the film takes to unwind. Howard Duff, starred as an unprincipled newspaper photographer named Jack Early, gives such a credible performance that the contrived script is not nearly as hard to accept as otherwise might be the case.Apparently this is to be the year when newspaper people are to be represented on the screen as something less than honorable custodians of the public's trust. A little while back, in "The Underworld Story," a publisher tried to cover up a murder committed by his son by involving an innocent party.Now, in "Shakedown," we have a photographer working in cahoots with a racketeer to expose a rival in the act of a holdup. Early gets the picture—to be sure, he's a pretty ingenious fellow with a camera—but he holds back the negative clearly showing the robbers in order to blackmail them for a cut of the swag. He then double-crosses his gangster friend and sets a death trap for him because he has designs on the latter's wife.Jack Early is about as black a character as you are apt to run across and, considering gangland justice, if not the Production Code, his own doom is inevitable. But don't think the authors let down their nasty creation at the end. No indeed, for Early manages with his last spark of life to photograph his murderer.Mr. Duff is seldom off the screen in "Shakedown" and his acting never falters, even though the script frequently does. Brian Donlevy and Lawrence Tierney are convincing as the gangsters; Bruce Bennett is indecisive as the managing editor who is troubled by Early's ruthless ambition, and Peggy Dow and Anne Vernon are competent as the photo editor and gangster's wife, respectively.Aside from having an unusually vicious protagonist practising an honorable profession, "Shakedown" is just about average as crime melodramas go. SHAKEDOWN, screen play by Alfred Lewis Levitt and Martin Goldsmith based on a story by Nat Dallinger and Don Martin; directed by Joe Pevney; produced by Ted Richmond for Universal-International.

833-> THE SCREEN; Standard Crime Film
The most disturbing and depressing of the many depressing things about the Strand's current Warner Brothers' shocker, "Highway 301," is the fact that governors in Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina endorse this cheap gangster melodrama as an effective deterrent to crime. In forewords which are personally delivered by Maryland's lame-duck Governor Lane and by Virginia's and North Carolina's Governors Battle and Scott, respectively, these eminent and honorable officials convey the solemn idea that what you are about to see is something that will prove to you how profitless crime is.And what you see is a conventional modern-day cops-and-robbers film, based on the dismal depredations of the so-called Tri-State gang, in which robbing and shooting and violence are exhibited for pure sensation's sake, with the gangsters annihilated in a juicy blood-bath at the end.Opening with the supposed robbery of a bank in Winston-Salem, N. C., by a gang of five sinister hoodlums, not one of whom would win a brain-test prize, this picture recounts their adventures in their escapes, their other crimes and with their "molls" through a series of ticklish moments, until the cops finally give them the works. Steve Cochran plays the gang leader, so he's the most arrogant of the mob, and Gaby Andre as a naive French-Canadian is the most sympathetic of the "molls." As other gangsters, Robert Webber, Richard Egan and Wally Cassell are standard muggs, and Virginia Grey is acerbic as a "moll" who tries to play the game.However, the whole thing, concocted and directed by Andrew Stone, is a straight exercise in low sadism. And the reactions at the Strand yesterday among the early audience, made up mainly of muscular youths, might have shocked and considerably embarrassed the governors mentioned above.On the stage at the Strand are Dave Apollon and his company, Tommy Wonder, Peggy Mann, Lee Marx, Danny Capri and Florian Zabach and his band.

975-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; 'Seven Days to Noon,' British Film Dealing With A-Bomb, at Trans-Lux 52d Street
An intensely absorbing contemplation—that of the crisis which would occur in the crowded city of London if a scientist with an atom bomb got loose and threatened to blow up the city unless atom bombs were outlawed—is pursued with superb pictorial clarity and ever-tightening dramatic suspense in a spanking new British melodrama, "Seven Days to Noon." This terminally overwhelming picture, which John and Roy Boulting produced, opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux Theatre on Lexington Avenue at Fifty-second Street.Let it be written on the record that a more exciting climax for a film than the one arrived at in this picture would be hard to invent today. For there is certainly no thought more oppressive to urban populations right now than that of an atom bomb exploding in their immediate midst. And the torment of fearfully waiting for a bomb to go off at a stated time, unless the man who controls it can be captured, is probably the most torturing to be conceived. This is the terrible anxiety that is patiently constructed in this film.As the frightened officials in London, from the Prime Minister on down, prepare to cope with the problem and the people themselves begin to wonder as the rumors get around, there creeps in, too, a comprehension of the terrible responsibility which the control of the destructive forces of atomic energy presents. And the real implications of this picture are not so much in the crisis dramatized as they are in the image of destruction of civilization that this spectacle provokes.From the moment that an innocent-looking letter is dropped through the Prime Minister's door and the city of London begins moving on an average Monday morning, the heat is on. To be sure, it glows fitfully and mildly (which is typically British) at the start, as Scotland Yard launches a checkup on the scientist from whom the letter comes. And it doesn't assume intense proportions even after the threat is verified and the hunt for the mad, elusive scientist has been going for several days.Indeed, the midsection of this picture has an oddly pedestrian pace for a drama about a mounting crisis, and a flaw appears in the postulate. Assuming that the purpose of the officials is to apprehend the scientist at all costs, it would seem not only practical but forgivable to promise the madman his wish—at least, a consideration—to prevent him from firing his bomb.The answer may be that this film is a parable on the whole social-political problem of the bomb and that such a promise would represent appeasement. Be that as it may, there is this hole in the plot.However, the crisis—and the picture—assume proportions of significance and suspense as the job of evacuating London entirely is decided upon and this major maneuver in transportation is represented on the screen. Here the Boulting brothers—their talents were spread throughout the film—hàve summoned and demonstrated their great passion for journalistic style. With London itself as their set, with its transportation system their props and with its people as their actors, they have staged such a mass exodus, with all its attendant graphic details, as you would think only newsreel cameras could catch. And the ultimate search of the empty city by military units as the zero hour draws near is as tensely exciting and compelling as any realistic war scene ever filmed.In this remarkable picture the Boultings have well employed a cast of uncommonly good actors whose names and faces are little known. Barry Jones, who plays the fugitive scientist, combines a frightening furtiveness with a poignant display of confusion and of despair over the "blindness" of men. Sheila Manahan is touching as his daughter and Olive Sloane does a picturesque job as a broken-down musical actress who innocently harbors the fugitive. Andre Morell as the Scotland Yard inspector and Ronald Adam as the Prime Minister well represent the coolness and determination of British officialdom.To this reviewer, the most significant line in the picture comes when the scientist, unsuspected, overhears a man say in a pub that bombs should be dropped on the "enemy" before the enemy candrop his. Angrily and sadly the scientist says that the man "ought to be made to think about the things he says." As well as entertainment, this film provides something big to think about, too. SEVEN DAYS TO NOON, screen play by Frank Harvey and Roy Boulting, from an original story by Paul Deher and James Brand; directed by John Boulting; produced by Roy Boulting for London Films; presented by Maylux Pictures and released by Arthur Mayer-Edward Kingsley-Distinguished Films.

Not brisk enough, however.Once again Producer Nat Holt, sponsored by Twentieth Century-Fox, is offering a long, parched ear of Western corn for those who crave it. Obviously many do, for Mr. Holt's samples are perennial and unchanging. Again we have a story about an honest, lantern-jawed cowboy clashing with the boss of a prairie town, photographed in Cinecolor, and performed by Mr. Holt's own stock company, headed, of course, by Randolph Scott.Trailing or crossing him we have Bill Williams, Karin Booth and Victor Jory. For comedy relief there is George (Gabby) Hayes, whose amiable wheezing and gumbaring are supposed to suggest that life can be beautiful, even in a Nat Holt Western. They do not. Also on hand, or hoof, is Mr. Hayes' faithful, temperamental jackass, Hannibal, who rates a close-up or two, and closes the picture on one of Mr. Holt's mountain tops braying his fool head off.

1261-> Psychological Mystery Opens at Thalia
The Thalia Theatre has imported from Germany a murky psychological mystery called "Secrets of a Soul." While this drama about a woman who fears that insanity is overtaking her may be clinically correct, it is presented in such a plodding and confusing fashion that one's patience is likely to expire before the film itself does. For there are times when the script gets so bogged down in psychiatric mumbo-jumbo that this spectator, at least, began to wonder whether his own personality wasn't beginning to split.In seeking the cause for Johanna Stegen's mental disturbance, "Secrets of a Soul" discovers via a long flashback that this Teutonic lady is a scientifically molded personality, who, in her original state, had distinctly Oriental features, which disappeared when a mask was made of her face.In that dim past there was a man with unusual hypnotic powers who loved her and believed that she enjoyed his affection. After Johanna's transformation, Robert Lorm lost track of her for a while, but he retained that old yearning. And when he found her again and discovered that she was in love with a mutual friend, Dr. Martin, Lorm put a hypnotic whammy not only on Johanna but on the doctor as well. The result is that the good doctor is feeding marijuana instead of vitamins to Johanna in his attempt to calm her mental qualms.Quite an involved piece of plotting as you can see. But "Secrets of a Soul" is not even as lucid as this synopsis, because the explanation for the strange behavior of both the doctor and the patient does not begin to break the surface until very late in the picture. Marianne Hoppe, Gustav Froehlich and Richard Haeussler are the principals, and while their performances are not distinguished, they appear to be competently confused. The English titles are frequent and helpful, but it would take a major job of rewriting to make the story clear. SECRETS OF A SOUL, screenplay by Dr. Harald Braun and Dr. Rolf Reissmann; directed by Kurt Hoffmann; produced by Neue Deutsche Filmgesellschaft in the American zone of Germany; presented by Cosmopolitan Pictures.Johanna Stegen . . . . .

1346-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; For Heaven's Sake,' With Joan Bennett, Robert Cummings and Clifton Webb, at Roxy
A highly popular fancy with writers in Hollywood is that of presuming that angels should visit the earth in natural form and variously aid in directing the destinies of the human race, usually at the cost of some confusion to the goggle-eyed members thereof. Such an angel—or heavenly messenger—is played by Clifton Webb in Twentieth Century-Fox's Christmas present to the Roxy, "For Heaven's Sake."In this extravagant fancy Mr. Webb is an agent from on high who is assigned to the task of arranging that a theatrical couple should decide to have a child. Seems that this couple has been so busy doing its theatrical work that it hasn't got around to completing its necessary family-raising chores. And so its predestined daughter, waiting seven years to be born, is tugging at Mr. Webb's coattails, urging him to speed her parents on.We hope that you follow up to this point. And we hope that you are not too dismayed at what must sound (and what is) a rather painfully quaint and whimsical start. For the picture begins to get funny when the angel casts himself in the disguise of a visible and miraculous Western and enters the lives of the theatrical couple to do his job. And it continues to be inanely comic so long as Mr. Webb is clomping around, putting on an act like Gary Cooper and occasionally twanging swing on a harp.Mr. Webb, need we say, is an actor with an urbane sense of the grotesque and a thoroughly cultivated talent for farcical mimicry. So his broad travesty of a rancher "from God's country," whose particular line is "sheep" and whose weakness is wine and women, is very amusing to see.Joan Blondell is also briefly funny as a lady playwright who would like to lure this cautious but susceptible stranger into investing money in a show. (Such investors, of course, are called "angels," which makes for some apt perplexities.) Joan Bennett and Robert Cummings are likewise nice as the husband and wife marked to be coaxed into begetting, and Jack La Rue has a very funny bit as a low-budget gangster actor who is very easily cowed.But we have to advise that the whimsies with which this picture begins and in which it dissolves at the climax are far on the sticky side—the sort of stuff that may seem poignant if you're a softie, but nauseous if you're not. And the same comment goes for the performances of Edmund Gwenn and Gigi Perreau as Mr. Webb's angelic companion and the unborn daughter, respectively. We might also add that a little boy, also unborn, is hanging around, begging to be put in circulation. But let's not get started on him.For most of this comedy and whimsey, you have to thank—or blame—George Seaton, who archly directed from his own conglomerate script. The latter was based, be it added, on a Harry Segall play, which, we suspect, drew some slight inspiration from Sir James M. Barrie and Charles Lamb. Mr. Segall, you might remember, tossed out the "original" idea for the fanciful "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" several years ago. Frankly, we fear that Mr. Segall has been working his side of the street too long. "For Heaven's Sake" prompts us to advice him: Metaphysician, cure thyself.On the stage at the Roxy is a gala Christmas show featuring Gertrude Ribala as soloist in an "Ave Maria" spectacle, plus Elsa and Waldo, Arsene Gautier and his steeplechasing dogs, Romayne and Brent, Joan Hyldoft, and the Gae Foster Roxyettes. FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, screen play by George Seaton, from a play by Harry Segall; directed by Mr. Seaton; produced by William Perlberg for Twentieth Century-Fox. At the Roxy.Charles . . . . .

1356-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW
Let us trust that the United Nations does not usually have to depend for its vital information upon channels as bizarre and involved as those represented in "Spy Hunt," the thriller now on the Palace's screen. If such were the situation, it would be rather tough for the U. N. For the trouble all starts in this picture when a British agent in Italy, assigned to the task of transmiting a bit of important microfilm to Lake Success, hits on the novel scheme of hiding the critical item in the collar of a wild beast, a sleek and beautiful black panther, which is being shipped to the United States.Naturally, the enemy agents learn where the microfilm is lodged and wreck the freight car transporting the panther while it is going through the Alps. But, in the invariable fashion of enemy agents, they bungle the job and the highly exotic secret courier makes a precipitous escape. Thus begins a complex stalking of the uncooperative beast, with a trio of mysterious fellows gratuitously joining the hunt, while the anxious lady agent of the British tries to lure the fugitive courier away from them.No need to make much comment on the artistic merits of this film. That outline of the melodramatic story gives a fair notice of same. Marta Toren, who plays the British agent, is valid, however, in one respect: she acts as naive and dopey as her stratagem would indicate she is. Howard Duff, Philip Friend and Robert Douglas are brash as some of the men in her life. George Sherman's direction for Universal is of the elementary school.Withal, we are grateful to this picture for inspiring one hope in our mind which, for all its disquieting implications, did cause some momentary cheer. That was the hope that the panther might elude the cold-blooded pursuit and turn up, beaming and triumphant at the office of Trygve Lie. We hate to have to tell you, in conclusion, that it does not, although the microfilm information does eventually reach Lake Success.On the vaudeville bill at the Palace are Keaton and Armfield, Catrom Brothers, Hamtree Harrington and Louise and five other acts. SPY HUNT, screen play by George Zuckerman and Leonard Lee, based on the novel, "Panther's Moon," by Victor Canning; directed by George Sherman and produced by Ralph Dietrich for Universal-International.
