THE case of the little runaway farm boy who is befriended by the prostitute with a heart of gold in Our Town is projected with amateurish dedication in "Terror in the City," which was benignly exposed in local theaters yesterday. Although there is a mere modicum of terror here, this modestly-budgeted fiction, which was shot hereabouts and on some bucolic sites four years ago, has the attributes of authentic views of both sleazy and fancy Manhattan and a few restful rustic vistas. But most of its principals are awkward and uneasy in the trite situations of a labored story.Richard Bray, as the blond youngster who is exposed to a gang of West Side toughs on his first day here, is naturally childish and confused. Lee Grant, perhaps best known for her portrayal of the sad, dumb dame in "Detective Story," tries but rarely succeeds in bringing conviction to the role of the loving prostitute. Roberto Marsach, as a knowledgeable Puerto Rican kid who takes young Bray under his wing, is charming and unaffected."How can you sell love?" Bray asks him."It ain't easy," young Marsach says, proving the case for the entire cast, who never do sell it to a viewer, either. TERROR IN THE CITY; written and directed by Allen Baron; produced by Mr. Baron, Merrill Brody and Dorothy E. Reed and released by Allied Artists. At local theaters.

1439-> Screen: 'Lotna' and 'Tsar to Lenin' Have Premieres:The Russian Revolution Recorded on Film
TO Dan Talbot, the manager of the New Yorker Theater, the debt of local filmgoers is large. Mr. Talbot has brought us a number of valuable films (mostly foreign) that we might otherwise never have seen. A case could be made that the recurring New Yorker festival has, so far, been at least as rewarding as the annual hyper-compressed New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center.This is by way of prelude to the opinion that Mr. Talbot's latest presentation is one of the worst he has imported and one of the worst foreign films I can remember. It is "Lotna," which means "swift," and was made in 1959 by Andrzej Wajda, the Polish director best known for his trilogy "A Generation," "Kanal" and "Ashes and Diamonds." (His latest film is called simply "Ashes," an epic of the Napoleonic wars, recently shown at the Cannes Festival.)In my view, Wadja's trilogy—which is concerned with Poland during and immediately after the Second World War—is patently imitative of Russian and French models, self-consciously dramatic and basically spurious. But it does have a certain arty gloss. The one interesting point about "Lotna" is a negative one: it was made after the trilogy, yet it is much cruder in technique and structure.The title is the name of a horse—a dappled gray mare that is acquired by a Polish cavalry company retreating before the Germans in 1939. The mare symbolizes the chivalric spirit of old Poland doomed by the mechanized Germans and the new age. That symbol might have been effective in a film; but the use of it here is so choppy and silly that this picture seems considerably longer than its 88 minutes.Matters start tackily enough when the mare makes her way through a huge mansion to her dying master's bedside, where the soldiers find her. She soon passes into the hands of a young officer who, through a coincidence that would shame a decadent capitalist filmmaker, encounters a girl he once knew. Precipitously, the young couple marry, and on the wedding night, the young man steals away for a look at the mare. Later, the pair are forced to spend that wedding night in the stable.It is the most blatant case of equine alienation of affections since Robinson Jeffers's "Roan Stallion."One of the lamentably recognizable Wajda touches is the device of having the wedding service coincide with the burial service of an officer killed in battle. As the bride leaves the church, her veil catches on the coffin. This is ironic and meaningful — for those whose demands in irony and meaning are slight.Mixed in with this horsy glue are some shots of slaughter, but they do not make realism out of what is essentially an inferior romance for children, photographed — except for some sepia stretches—in dreadful color.Wajda is one of the leaders of the postwar Polish film renascence that produced, among others, Roman Polanski, the director of "Knife in the Water" and "Repulsion." (I think I glimpsed Polanski, who has been an actor, as a shiny-helmeted bandsman at the wedding.) As a pioneer in this movement, Wajda has some importance — hence, I suppose, Mr. Talbot's interest. Those who share this historical interest may feel that they have to see "Lotna." The CastLOTNA, screenplay by Wojciech Zukrowswi and Andrzej Wajda, directed by Mr. Wajda and produced by Film Polski. Released by Pol-Ton Films. At the New Yorker Theater, Broadway and 88th Street. Running time: 88 minutes.Lieutenant Wodnicki . . . . . Adam PawlikowskiEnsign Grabowski . . . . . Jerzy MoesCaptain Chodakiewicz . . . . . Jerzy PichelskiEwa . . . . . Bozena KurowskaTHIS film has many virtues and one major, crippling fault that almost negates them. It is well worth seeing, but one can only grieve at the opportunity that was missed.The virtues are implicit in the flow of living history. Here are all the great actors in the most important political event of the 20th century, the Bolshevik Revolution, risen from the pages of the history books and come to life again at the height of their glory. Here are the simple-minded Czar Nicholas, his catastrophically stupid wife and their hemophiliac son, who did so much to prepare the way for the tragedy. The scenes showing them at play and at public ceremonies convey powerfully the atmosphere in which they prepared their doom.Here are Kerensky and Lenin and Trotsky and scores of lesser characters caught in action as they struggled at the center of the whirlpool. Here are the masses in Russia and other countries recorded imperishably on film, while they shaped the destiny of the world as soldiers in World War I and as participants on both sides of Russia's civil war. It is almost as though a time machine had transported us back a half-century, so that we could see that which took place before we were born. No mere words could convey the terrible reality of those years so eloquently as this celluloid chronicle does.Regrettably, however, this treasure of filmed history was turned over to people whose knowledge and understanding of the events is shaky at best and at times completely lacking. They prepared a commentary marred by too many inaccuracies and misinterpretations, some very elementary. As a result, much of the educational potential of the rich raw material is lost, and the viewer who has not had the foresight to put cotton in his ears is misled. It would have been so easy to hire somebody who knows the history of the period and to have him correct at least the most egregious errors. While, if a competent historian had worked on this picture, something outstanding might have resulted.But the intrinsic story of Russia's agony in 1917, what led up to it and what followed is too important and too interesting to be ruined even by such incompetence. A much better and even great film might have been made, but even this has tremendous fascination."Tsar to Lenin" is no doubt the beginning of a deluge of movies, television documentaries and books to celebrate next year's 50th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. Let us hope that those whose efforts come after this partially botched job will learn from its missed opportunity. Agony of 1917TSAR TO LENIN—A documentary film about the Russian Revolution of 1917 and its immediate aftermath. Produced by Herman Axelbank; text and film editing by William Hepper and Cyril Jones; narration by Valentine Dyall. At the Trans-Lux Theater, Broadway and 49th Street. Running time: 90 minutes.
