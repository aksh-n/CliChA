224-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
Bar Harbor, by a vote little less than unanimous, has exercised the power granted it by the Maine Legislature to exclude automobiles from the corporate limits. Of the other three towns on the island, only Southwest Harbor is of a different mind, but the single exception is enough to complicate the situation seriously, since its residents cannot reach the mainland with their cars without passing through prohibited territory.

Open-air burlesque rather than baseball was presented on the Hilltop stage yesterday by the New York and Cleveland Clubs. Here and there incidents reminded one of the National game, but on the whole it was a travesty. The Yankees won by a score of 10 to 0.

--------
236-> WHAT NEW YORK NEEDS.
The trouble with New York City is not that so many of its residents are apt to talk freely of its obvious defects, but that they generally do so little as citizens toward removing those defects. This year, we trust, the sober-minded citizens will give serious heed to the great question of municipal reform and improvement. 
--------

240-> A FRIEND OF FRANCE.
It is a very attractive picture that the Baron D'ESTOURNELLES DE CONSTANT draws of the German Emperor as reported in the cable dispatches of THE SUNDAY TIMES.

244-> THE NEW FIFTH AVENUE.
On the whole, the widening of Fifth Avenue between Twenty-sixth and Forty-Seventh Streets promises architectural improvement in a thoroughfare, which at its best, as a street of residences of the well-to-do, was never beautiful. Since its transformation into a business street the facade on both sides of the way in that part of it now being widened has been uncompromisingly ugly.

LONDON, Oct. 9. -- Among all who know J.M.

--------
246-> A CHAPTER OF BLUNDERS.
If prior to the appointment of Mr. CRANE as Minister to China it had been difficult for the President to find a man of high qualification willing to accept that post, we should say, in view of the circumstances of Mr. CRANE'S resignation, that it would now be impossible.

Mr. GOMPERS is fighting his way into jail with an energy and methods worthy of the most advanced of the British suffragette sisterhood. If Mr. GOMPERS succeeds in his contention anybody can print anything without fear of the result. His contention, nominally for the liberty of the press, is really for license to injure your neighbor to your own satisfaction and without penalty,

CONSTANTINOPLE, July 7. -- One of the first measures of economic reforms instituted by the Young Turk Government is the wholesale dismissal of officials of all ranks most of whom while on small salaries have grown wealthy by graft.

Officially it was called the Hudson-Stevens-Fulton Celebration, but Hoboken will always remember it for the Stevens part of it. Last Thursday's parade in the city across the river was more in honor of the man first to operate a steam screw propelled boat in this country than in memory of Hudson's discovery of the great waterway or Fulton's achievement with the side-paddle-steamboat.

513-> PROPOSALS FOR A WIDER 42D STREET; Fifth Avenue Improvement Likely to Hasten Work on Cross-town Thoroughfare. VARIOUS PLANS PENDING Changes Could Be Made Rapidly, as Many Owners Have Already Removed Encroachments.
It will be interesting to note what effect the widening of Fifth Avenue, relieving as it does the traffic congestion on that thoroughfare, will have upon the proposition, broached some time ago, and at present laid over with favorable resolutions by the Board of Estimate, to widen Forty-second Street from Sixth to Madison Avenue by cutting back its sidewalks to sixteen feet on either side. 
--------
514-> THE LOWERED PRICE OF ICE.
Some say it was the competition of the artificial ice companies that caused the Ice Trust to lower its wholesale price from $5 to $3 a ton, with a resultant decline in the retail price as low as from 25 to 40 cents a hundred pounds. A better explanation would be in the fact that the Summer is far advanced.

519-> VOTING A DUTY.; But Thinks Denial of Votes to Women a Relic of Savagery.
If "Spinster and Taxpayer," who writes opposing woman suffrage, will compare the popular vote cast in New York State for Taft last election, 870,070 votes, and compare it with the total number of inhabitants of New York State as reported by the census of 1905, which gives it as 8,067,308, she will not be able to support her contention that we are governed by majorities.

--------
522-> PUBLIC SERVICE PROPOSALS.
It would be interesting to know just why the Public Service Commission puts out its latest explanation of the rapid transit situation. All that is new in the case is the criticisms of the various spending proposals, and apparently the authors of the official plans deem the criticisms of their schemes damaging enough to require a fresh presentation.

Sophie Hasam, the woman who was found asleep in the vestibule of the home of the Rev. C.T.

OVERSPECIALIZATION is the warning cry of modern educators. The world is for every man, and man is the aim and consummation. Do not turn his brain or his body into a machine. And if there were danger of this, it would be a danger to rouse us to battle. But I think the teachers have misunderstood.

665-> THE YOUNG CRETANS.; They Aspire to Reunion with Greek National Life.
The approaching withdrawal of the garrisons of the powers from Crete makes the situation there acute.

--------
667-> PRINCE BUEL0W'S "RETIREMENT."
The official announcement that the weary invalid who has borne for so long the worrying burden of the Chancellorship of the German Empire will shortly retire does not bear close examination. The retirement is dependent on a condition which it seems increasingly difficult for the incumbent to fulfill, namely, the passage in the Reichstag of the Government's bills for financial reform.

668-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
I second the motion therefore, for the amendment proposed; and the more readily because I am certain it will be more agreeable to the citizens of the United States to see the head of Liberty on their coin than the heads of Presidents.

669-> THE CHINESE MURDER.
Perhaps three fellow-countrymen of the Chinese rascal named LEON LING have been killed by friends of LEON since the murder of ELSIE SIGEL, because they knew something about the case, and it was feared that they would tell the police what they knew. The yarns connecting the murders of CHAUN LOK WING, the Chinese Vice Consul, a laundryman, and a restaurant keeper, with the Sigel case, however, are by no means convincing.

--------
671-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.
Speculative sentiment is very uncertain at the moment, at least so far as the general run of traders is concerned, and possibly many professionals might be included in this analysis of the situation. Some stocks in yesterday's market showed an ability to remain firm, possibly due to lack of pressure more than anything else, while others, under pressure, broke easily and exhibited what might be described as momentary weakness. 
--------
672-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.; Melon Prospects in Hard Coalers.

673-> Article 11 -- No Title
NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 8. -- While the Government Census Bureau's report of 377,552 bales ginned up to Sept. 1 was construed as slightly bullish, the figures were about what had been expected by the local trade. Following, the posting of the report the market opened 13 points up, but the advance over yesterday's close was attributed more to heavy spot sales and Liverpool than to the report on ginnings. 
--------
674-> TEN CENTS TO CONEY ISLAND.
Under the New York State law for the regulation of public utilities things are taking a course similar to that under the Federal law regulating inter-State commerce. That is to say, the heinous practices of the corporations are little disturbed, and in some cases actually are justified, while the public officials take the places of the corporations as objects of public condemnation.

675-> MUST AMEND AUTO RULE.; Vanderbilt Entry Blanks Held Up Until Change in Code is Made.
There has been some speculation on the part of manufacturers and dealers as to why the issuance of entry blanks for the Vanderbilt Cup race had been delayed.

In Boston two houses are exhibited as the birthplace of Franklin, showing, as Mark Twain said, that he was twins, but, this being the case, it is unkind of Mr. C.R.L.

There are hundreds of competent, respectable lawyers in this city who would be glad of the chance Judge MALONE has humorously offered to Mr. HORNBLOWER.

It is strange that the brewers of Texas, like the manufacturers of intoxicants throughout the country, are unable to appreciate the fact that about the only proof of the efficiency of prohibition, convincing to anybody not a Prohibitionist, is the manifest fear of it shown by the liquor men and the energy with which they everywhere antagonize it.

Nothing in the market yesterday excited particular attention among traders or brokers, and topics of conversation were developed from reminiscences rather than from actual present conditions.

--------
1083-> THE BUDGET IN THE ELECTION.
The increase of last year's budget by $6,500,000 is an election augury of the happiest sort.

PATCHOGUE, L.I., Aug. 28. -- So successful was the special motor boat race held by the South Bay Yacht Club on Saturday that contests of this character are bound to become a permanent feature on the Great South Bay.

ABAFT the Tunnel" is like an echo from other days. In many ways it is an interesting book; most of the stories have the true Kipling flavor, and some of them are quite up to what we might expect from their illustrious author. Most of them are taken, I notice, not from The Civil and Military Gazette, nor yet from The Pioneer, but from the comparatively little known Turnovers and Week's News.

Your editorial on the Jamaica Bay accident is admirable and suggests some of the things that would have been done under the circumstances by experienced people.

The reply of Dr. W.H. MAXWELL, City Superintendent of Schools, to the report of the Bureau of Municipal Research fixing upon the Board of Education the chief if not sole responsibility for the part-time evil is even tempered and wise.

" A Victorian farce" exactly describes "The Noble Spaniard" in regard to costumes and plot, but it need not be supposed that to appreciate it one must have lived in the middle of the Victorian era. Quite the contrary, as last night's audience discovered. In other words this new play of W. Somerset Maugham's is very amusing.

The future of Col. THEODORE ROOSEVELT still engages the attention of his admirers.

--------
1387-> TAMMANY'S GOLDEN TEXT.
It is natural for the language of Tammany's candidate, the Christian jurist, to possess a Scriptural flavor, but it is somewhat surprising to remark how his example has affected the unregenerate Wigwam. Upon its election literature, Pamphlet No. 1, and under the heading "The Problem of New York's Government," those who read may find this golden text:

In respect to clarity for those who have not read the book, Miss Charlotte Thompson's dramatization of Margaret Deland's novel, "The Awakening of Helena Richie," may be freely commended, and, as most people who go to the theatre know, clarity in the dramatization of a best seller is a quantity often conspicuous by its absence.

The reader of Swinburne's prose works would do well to bear in mind that the author was first of all a poet -- a fiery, impassioned boy, who never knew manhood in the sense that colder critics like Arnold and Stedman knew it, and who loved and hated throughout his seventy years of youth with an unreasoning intensity impossible to better balanced and worse inspired natures.

--------
1421-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
When Mr. DANIEL GUGGENHEIM, in a recent interview, advised young men to go to Alaska as the land which to-day offers more opportunities than any other for the ambitious seeker after fortune and advancement, his account of the conditions and possibilities existing there may have owed much of its glow and warmth to the fact that his railway and mining enterprises in the Far North would not suffer if cheaper labor were abundant there.
