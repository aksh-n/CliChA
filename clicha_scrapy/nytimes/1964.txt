0-> Rhodesia Conciliation Stalled
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., March 6—The Secretary General, U Thant, reported “no progress” today in his continuing efforts to promote conciliation in Southern Rhodesia. Mr. Thant informed the 24‐member Special Committee on Colonialism that no headway had been made. The African majority has been pressing for political rights, so far denied by the white minority Government.

1-> MASONS PERFORM BENEFIT COCERT; Brotherhood Fund Is Aided by St. Cecile Orchestra
Many of the members of St. Cecile Lodge 568, Free and Accepted Masons, are professional musicians, and last night alrmost 100 of them gave a concert at Philharmonic Hall. They played under the name of the St. Cecile Masonic Symphony Orchestra of New York. Frederick Dvonch, a lodge member who has had conducting opportunities in musical comedy, conducted. The soloist, Anatole Kitain, was also a member of the lodge. He played the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 2. The other big work was the Brahms Symphony No. 1. Morton Gould's “American Salute Orchestra” was the opening work; Tchaikovsky's “1812” Overture was the closing one. The concert raised money for the Masonic Brotherhood Fund, which supports the Masonic Foundation for Medical Research and Human Welfare and the Masonic Home and Hospital in Utica, N. Y. The concert honored Harry Ostrov Grand Master of Masons in the State of New York. Mr. Ostrov was introduced after the intermission by Samuel Weiss, chairman of the concert committee. And Mr. Ostrov put his finger on the best quality of the concert. Understandably, the performances were not the most polished in the world, for the men are not able to play together very much. But they showed “how brethren can work together in unity” and the members not only played their instruments, but they “played with their hearts.” ROSS PARMENTER.

2-> MASONRY PATCHING: Repairs Easily Made With New Materials
THIS is the time of year when many home. handymen tackle the job of making repairs on concrete walls and floors, as well as on all kinds of paved terraces, brick stoops and other masonry surfaces. Alternate freeze‐and-thaw cycles encountered during the winter months, combined with the settling of soil and attack by ice‐melting chemicals may have caused concrete to crack or crumble — and may also have caused loosening of bricks, stones and other paving materials. Though conventional cement‐and-sand mixtures can be used for many jobs of this type, the home handyman will often find that the newer la‑ tex or vinyl patching cements ill be quicker and easier to use—and on most jobs they will also provide a stronger bond. As an example, conventional concrete will not adhere properly unless the patch is at least ½-inch in thickness (one inch is better), while the plastic types will bond in layers as thin as 1/16 of an inch in thickness, thus eliminating all need for chopping out or chipping away of the .old material. It also eliminates the need for undercutting broken edges to secure a good bond. Another characteristic of these new materials is that they do not require wetting down or soaking of the old surface before the patching compound can be applied; and the patch, when finished, is completely “self‐curing.” (Ordinary concrete has to be cured by keeping newly applied material damp for a day or two while it hardens.) Available from paint and hardware stores, department stores and lumber yards, the first new type of patching material introduced was the latex concrete. This actually consists of two parts: a powdered cement and a liquid latex. To use, the two parts must be mixed together in the proper proportions before use, then blended smoothly till a uniform mixture is achieved. Since it dries quickly, the handyman should mix only as much as he can use in about one hour, keeping proportions correct to insure full strength of the patch. Eliminating the need for accurate mixing and measuring of this kind, a one‐part vinyl‐concrete patching compound is now available. Currently sold under at least two different brand names (Vulcan's Vinyl‐Crete and Silcoa's Aqua‐Dri) these new concrete patching compounds consist of a single powder which need only be mixed with water to make it ready for use. Enough water is added to make a smooth buttery mixture (1½ to 2 pints of water per 10 pound bag) after which the material should he allowed to soak for 10 or 15 minutes before use. The material is then stirred once more and the consistency adjusted, if necessary, by adding a little more water or cement to the batch. Packaged in ten‐pound bags and in gallon‐size cans (which also contain ten pounds), field tests have indicated that these vinyl‐concrete patching compounds actually have greater adhesive strength and improved resistance to cracking and chipping. Because they can be troweled on as thin as 1/16 of an inch, ten pounds will cover anywhere from 10 to 20 square feet of area when used for resurfacing of rough concrete floors. Their exceptional adhesive strength will also permit bonding to many other materials — including brick, tile, glass, marble and metal. These qualities make vinyl‐concrete compounds ideal for smoothing over rough areas on all, types of masonry, as well as for creating an underlayment on cracked or chipped floors which are to be covered with tile. Their adhesive properties also make them excellent for replacing loose bricks and slates on paved walks and steps, as well as for literally “welding” back broken sections which have come loose on masonry structures of all kinds. Because these compounds will bond over painted surfaces as well, they solve the problem of how to resurface cracked or rough floors which have already been painted over (without removing all of the old paint first). Waterproofing ingredients are included in each formulation to insure a waterproof patch which will permanently seal defective joints and porous sections on any masonry wall or floor. As when applying any other type of masonry patching material, these vinyl‐concrete patching compounds should be forced into the crevice or depression with sufficient force to press the material firmly into contact with the old surface. Loose dirt, dust and crumbly material should be brushed out first, and grease or oil should be scrubbed off completely before the new material is applied. When building, up corners on broken steps or other areas where the patch will have no support, the material should be mixed to a slightly stiffer consistency than usual so that it will hold its shape when troweled on. Though it can be safely applied in almost any kind of weather, it should not he used when temperatures are lower than 40 degrees, and it is best to avoid working on hot surfaces when temperatures climb up into the nineties.

4-> Suspended Football Players, Reinstated by the N.F.L.; Pro Football Ban on Hornung and Karras Lifted After 11 Months; BOTH MAKE PLANS TO REJOIN TEAMS; Hornung to Go to Green Bay for Workouts—Karras to Train With Lion Rookies
Paul Hornung of the Green Bay Packers and Alex Karras of the Detroit Lions were reinstated yesterday by Commissioner Pete Rozelle of the National Football League following 11‐month suspensions for betting on games. Their coaches, Vince Lombardi of the Packers and George Wilson of the Lions, warmly welcomed the playersback to the active rosters and put to rest rumors they would discard them. “Hornung will not be traded,” said Lombardi in Green Bay, without being asked, and Wilson said there was no thought of trading Karras. “He's the best defensive tackle in the league,” said Wilson, “the best pass rusher in a long time.” The athletes violated their player contracts by betting. Hornung wagered sums of $100 to $500 on dozens of contests between 1956 and 1961 (most often backing the Packers), and Karras $50 to $100 at least six times between 1958 and 1962. Although football ranks behind only horse racing and basketball as a medium of betting, N.F.L. players are forbidden to wager on it. As he had when the suspensions were first made, Rozelle emphasized yesterday that there was no evidence that either Hornung or Karras “ever bet against his own team or performed less than his best in any football game. ” In reviewing the case, the commissioner attempted to fit the penalty to the offense and decided that an 11‐month suspension, which included one season of play, was good enough. When the suspensions were announced last April 17, they were called “indefinite.” Rozelle ended the sentences after interviewing Hornung March 7 and Karras last Saturday in his office here “to explore their attitude and thinking.” Hornung had been repentant all along. “I did wrong ” he had said many times. “I should be penal‐ ized.” Karras, however, was at first indignant, asserting he had done nothing wrong, and it took him some months to change. Last December he announced the impending sale of his interest in the Lindell A.C., a bar frequented by “known hoodlums,” according to Detroit police. Karras was contrite yesterday. Interviewed in Detroit, he said the suspension “may have been the best thing that ever happened to me. Pro athletes get lulled into thinking their sports careers will last the rest of their lives. You don't know how much you miss something until you have it taken away.” A league statement yesterday said, “Personal discussions with Hornung and Karras have established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that each now has a clear understanding of the seriousness of the offenses and of the circumstances that brought them about.” Rozelle said that he believed both players understood “the double standard that applies to people who are in the public eye. They must be above reproach.” Rozelle was unable to reach the players by telephone yesterday morning to tell them the news and both were informed by reporters. Hornung, a bachelor, was awakened in a Miami Beach hotel. He said he was “very, very happy,” and wanted to thank the commissioner “for all the kindness he has shown me in this.” Lombardi, in Green Bay, passed a hint to his star halfback. The coach said, “We're happy to have him back, but I don't know what kind of shape he's in.” Hornung seemed to get the message. He said he would go to Green Bay immediately to start workouts under Lombardi's direction. “I'll have to get my legs back in shape,” said Hornung. The former Notre Dame allAmerica is 28 years old. Next season will be his seventh in pro football. The Green Bay halfback was the league's leading scorer for three years and set a season record with 176 points in 1960. In 1961 he was voted the league's most valuable player.The Packers won three championships with him—in 1960, '61 and '62 — and lost the title without him in 1963. Karras, the son of a Gary, Ind., physician, went to the University of Iowa. His older brother, Lou, played for the Washington Redskins and a younger brother, Ted, is a guard with the Chicago Bears. In recent months, Alex has been living with his wife's family in Clinton, Iowa, and teaching his 4‐year‐old son how to swim at the Y.M.C.A. He said yesterday he weighed 250 pounds, five below his playing weight and would report to training camp with the rookies. “That's what I am now,” he said. “I only wish I were that young.” Karras, 29, is heading into his sixth pro campaign.

5-> NICKEL PRODUCER SETS PROFIT MARK; International's Net for 1963 Rises by 41c a Share
The International Nickel Company of Canada, Ltd., exceeded $100 million in earnings last year for the first time, Henry S. Wingate, chairman, and J. Roy Gordon, president, reported yesterday. Net income for 1963 rose to $106,311,000, equal to $3.60 a share, from $94,221,000, or $3.19 a share, earned the year before. Net sales were $466,807,000 compared with $450,724,000. The company had the best quarter in the final three months when the net was $29,-259,000, or 99 cents a share. This compared with $22,210,000, or 75 cents a share, in the 1962 fourth quarter. The last quarter of 1963 was the second highest quarter on record, exceeded only by the $30,545,000, or $1.04 a share, earned in the final quarter of 1961. The resurgence of the steel industry throughout the nonCommunist countries was a major factor in the record use of nickel lats year which rose to 525 million pounds. This was an increase of 52 million pounds over 1962 and 19 million pounds more than the previous high of 506 million pounds in 1961. Deliveries of nickel in all forms were up 10 per cent to 350,730,000 pounds compared with 318,170.000 pounds the year before. Earnings also benefited from increased deliveries of platinumgroup metals and of iron ore, but were adversely affected by decreased copper deliveries, the officials stated. Such deliveries fell to 253,550,000 pounds from 267,280,000 pounds in 1962, reflecting reduced supplies resulting from 1962 curtailments of nickel production from the com‐pany's Ontario mines. Deliveries of platinum‐groupmetals and gold were 439,400 troy ounces, compared with 410,800 ounces in 1962; while deliveries of high‐grade iron ore were at a record 458,000 long tons against 425,000 tons in 1962.

6-> Superficial Documentary on a Complex Subject Presented on Channel 11
LAST night's documentary entitled “The Rise and Fall of American Communism” was a representative work of its producer, David Wolper. More than 40 years of history were compressed into an hour of brisk superficiality in which the narrator's cathedral tones and a bravura background score took the place of substance and perspective. The twists and turns of the American Communist party from its founding to its eclipse were traced on Channel 11 in the form of available newsreel clippings. The early stages of industrialization, the Depression, World War II, the Alger Hiss case, the era of McCarthyism and Khrushchev's break with Stalinism were telescoped into rapid fire and strident history a la Hollywood. Trust Mr. Wolper to make the complex and fascinating task simple and dull. The good guys won and the bad guys lost.

Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers, proposed yesterday that the United States devote $20 billion to an “all‐out peace offensive” in underdeveloped countries. He predicted that such a move would force the Soviet Union to disarm to compete in these areas. His recommendation was made in a report made public by the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions of Santa Barbara. Calif. Mr. Reuther declared that the United States could obtain the funds for the peace offensive by developing a solution for unemployment that would stop the “disastrous waste” of United States manpower He asked that allies of the United States add $5 billion to the drive.

8-> Quebec to Investigate Trial And Execution of Prospector
QUEBEC, Jan 8 (Canadian Press) — The Quebec Government today ordered an investigation into the trial and execution of Wilbert Coffin who was hanged in 1956 for the murder of three American hunters. The decision, taken at a Cabinet meeting, was announced by Attorney General René Hammmel. A book published last year asserted that Coffin, a Gaspe prospector, was innocent. The Government specifically ordered an investigation into “the credibility of statements” made by Francis Thompson to the police in Miami, Fla., in 1958. Mr. Thompson told the police he committed the murders, but later retracted the statement. The Americans, slain in a Gaspé forest in 1953, were Eugene Linsey, 47; his son, Richard, 17; and Frederick Claar, 20, of Hollidaysburg, Pa. Coffin was their guide.

10-> QUALITY VIEWING; N.B.C. Offers Full Day Of Cultural Treasures
ROBERT SARNOFF and Robert Kintner gave a demonstration last Sunday of how to pull the rug from under the membership of the Let's‐Despair‐Over‐TV Club. Between the hours of 10 in the morning and 11 at night, the chairman and the president of the National Broadcasting Company offered three altogether remarkable specials, two hours of the unforgettable performance of Mozart's Requiem by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, two hours of opera prepared by the network's own company and an hour's tour in prime evening time of the world of art. Were a publishing house to issue on one day three major volumes or a single Broadway producer to present as many productions on a given evening, one can fairly imagine the headl i nes and editorials hailing the cultural renaissance. Yet the N.B.C. network's accomplishment was not only the video equivalent of such a feat, it was also a mere part of the total TV day on N.B.C., on the other networks and on New York independent stations. The particular significance of last Sunday on N.B.C., however, was to pinpoint the affirmative in qualitative video. For all the running complaints against the medium—the commercial clutt e r and Hollywood pap—there are constructive forces doing precisely what is often asked of the medium. Each of the three cited programs constituted a distinctive use of the home screen; each was an example of collective program leadership that does not register in ratings or financial statements, only in cheers. When Henry Cabot, chairman of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and Richard Cardinal Cushing arranged the solemn pontifical mass in memory of President Kennedy, surely there could only be a yearning to be present at such an unusual religious and musical event. Yet the appearance of the symphony in the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston, as well as the presence of the 180‐voice chorus from Harvard, Radcliffe, the New England Conservatory of Music and the Boston Pro Musica, could be witnessed persona ll y by only 1,800 persons. N.B.C. responded to the opportunity opened to television and in so doing demonstrated that an appreciation of news values does include covering a major cultural event in full, only politics, disasters or sports. The inspired work by the N.B.C. crew under the supervision of George A. Heinemann reaffirmed another point as well. How much more moving and exciting is an outside cultural event when TV adjusts to the event's requirements rather than expecting the event to be tailored to the needs of TV. The beauty and power of the Mozart Requiem beggared description. Never once did the telecast resort to the usual cliché shots of an orchestra. Rather there was an implementation of the reverence in lovely views of the cathedral's interior and magnificent close‐ups of the altar. And the occasional glimpses of the disciplined in‐ tensity of Erich Leinsdorf was a special reward for a set owner accustomed to excesses in the demeanor of a conductor. The N.B.C. Opera Company is of course, one of television's older institutions, but its continuing existence as the medium's only theatrical group of its kind remains to the credit of the Messrs. Sarnoff and Kintner. The music critics were reserved about the Sunday production of Donizetti's “Lucia di Lammermoor,” but the Metropolitan is having a rough season, too. For the mass viewer who is much closer to Lucy than Lucia there were pleasures nonetheless and the condescending whining of the musicologists over the quality of audio reproduction on a TV set is beginning to grow tiresome. They should hear some of the other sounds on TV. N.B.C.'s employment of Mrs. Aline Saarinen, who was the guide on the “Art of Collecting,” in itself is of more than passing significance in TV. Not only is the art critic making [attractively tough judgments on matters of taste in her appearances on the “Today” program —she is the only person doing so on a regular network basis, incidentally—but she is twitting the smug position of the Federal Communications Commission that a broadcaster should run out and ask his community what it wants on the air. The point of broadcasting, she suggests, is to take the initiative in showing a community what it may have been missing. That was the precise joy of her Sunday hour. She introduced samplings of the various schools of art from great collections including those of Robert Lehman and Governor Rockefeller. With the camera slowly panning in and out on the canvases there was an absorbing diversity of perspectives. In exhibiting what the collectors preferred and in having most of them explain why, Mrs. Saarinen fulfilled a twofold objective. For the uninitiated there was a vivid lesson in the pleasure of collecting; for the connoisseur, there were scenes of many works rarely shown. But to be fully savored, Mrs. Saarinen's program had to be seen in color. Only in the love liness of the colors chosen by the artists could the viewing experience possibly be complete. In this regard the N.B.C. support of color TV must be judged in its proper perspective. Color TV is first a new tool of communication and only second a new consumer product; it is expanding the usefulness of TV in acquainting the mass audience with untold visual treasures. For any network to delay color's introduction on the ground that not enough color sets have been purchased, as the Columbia Broadcasting System alone is still wont to maintain, is to be culturally laggard and indifferent to the demands of progress. Mrs. Saarinen's program explicitly showed why. In the home there was the hush that attends the contemplation of the artistic masterpiece, the wondrous silence as one's eye tries to comprehend what it beholds. Who is to foretell the national gain when that experience is multiplied a millionfold in homes everywhere? Color TV no longer can be intra‐industry football. Last Sunday, Picasso put it in the public interest.

11-> BANKER DEFENDS A LOAN TO BAKER; Tells lnquiry Ex‐Senate Aide Got $125,000 for House Without Any Collateral
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20—A Washington banker told the Senate Rules Committee today that he gave Robert G. Baker an unsecured loan for the full cost of a new $125,000 house two years ago, and that he still regarded it as sound business. William F. Collins, vice president of the D. C. National Bank, also told the committee that Mr. Baker was an important stockholder in the bank, but that this had had no bearing on the preferential treatment the former Senate official had received. Mr. Collins, in more than an hour of questioning, adhered to his view that Mr. Baker, former secretary to the Senate Democratic majority, was a man of integrity and a good credit risk. He said that he had taken at face value the credit statements submitted by Mr. Baker at various times, and had not checked their accuracy. The committee announced late today that Nancy Carole Tyler, Mr. Baker's former secretary in the Capitol, had been subpoenaed to appear at an open session on Wednesday morning. Miss Tyler, a former beauty‐contest winner in her native Tennessee, occupies a town house Mr. Baker owns in southwest Washington. The committee has expressed interest in who paid for the elaborate furnishings and decorations in the $28,000 house. Mr. Baker has been summoned to give oral testimony at a public session on Tuesday. However, his attorney, Edward Bennett Williams, has informed the committee that Mr. Baker will invoke constitutional immunities against testifying, as he did yesterday when asked to produce some of his business papers. Most observers believe that Mr. Baker can hold to this decision without risking conviction for contempt of Congress. In other testimony today, a Puerto Rican official of the Interior Department described his role in bringing Mr. Baker and an importer of Haitian meat together in what proved to be a highly profitable venture for most of those concerned. The official was José A. Benitez, former Democratic State Chairman for Puerto Rico and currently Deputy High Commissioner for Pacific Trust Territories. He said that with the help of Mr. Baker and others, he was able to put Andreas Lopez, a Puerto Rican meat importer, in touch with the HaitianAmerican Meat Company, in Port‐au‐Prince. As a result, Mr. Benitez said, he received a finders' fee of one cent a pound on all meat the company shipped to Puerto Rico. He said that he divided this equally with Mr. Baker, Thomas D. Webb and Francis E. Law. Each share, he said, averages about $250 monthly and is still being paid. Mr. Benitez said he had no knowledge of whether Mr. Baker or any one else used improper influence to get the approval of the Department of Agriculture for the imports. Mr. Collins was on the stand more than an hour at an open session of the committee this morning. He reviewed the oganization of the bank in 1962, noting that it was the first banking institution to be chartered in the district in 23 years. He denied knowledge of any pressure exerted by Mr. Baker or anyone else to obtain approval of the new venture from the Cnntrnller of the Currency. He said that Mr. Baker had applied for 1,700 shares of the bank's initial stock issue, at $15 a share. He was permitted to buy only 1,500 shares, because the offering had been heavily oversubscribed. Memorandums from the bank's files were introduced in evidence as Mr. Collins testified about Mr. Baker's loans. One, dated March 11, 1963, noted that he had sought a loan of $125,000 to make a “very favorable” cash purchase of a new house, and that “Mr. Baker prefers not to employ normal mortgage financing.” The memorandum said that Mr. Baker had submitted a financial statement indicating a net worth of $2,166,000, consisting largely of investments and stocks, the largest holding being that in the Serv‐U Corporation, a vending ‐ machine company. It was also stated that “Mr. Baker's position within the U.S. Government recommends our serious consideration to this transaction as he is a gentleman with innumerable friendships and connections whose good offices in behalf of our bank could be very valuable to our growth.” Another memo, dated April 22, said: “We will make the loan on an unsecured basis for the present.” The witness was questioned by the committee counsel on whether he had investigated the financial statement submitted by Mr. Baker; whether he had learned, for example, that the Serv‐U stock Mr. Baker said he owned was, in fact, held for him by a trustee, and that most of Serv‐U's assets already were hypothecated for bank loans. The bank official said he had not. He said that he did not believe that he had been misled by Mr. Baker, and that he had “learned nothing [from the published reports of the committee's hearings] that changes my opinion about his integrity and his honesty.” Mr. Collins also said that the bank had made another unsecured loan of $10,000 to Mr. Baker on July 19, 1963. He said that payments on this and the loan on the house were being met promptly. On Oct. 1, 1963, the witness said the bank approved a loan of $48,518 to Serv‐U for the purchase of equipment of the Carousel Motel, which the vending company then owned by purchase from Mr. Baker and Donald and Gertrude Novak. Mr. Collins said he was not aware at the time that the Carousel was insolvent.

13-> LISTON IS CONFIDENT OF EARLY KNOCKOUT
LAS VEGAS, Nev., Jan. 2 (AP)—The world heavyweight champion, Sonny Liston, said today he didn't think it would take him more than two rounds to knock out Cassius Clay in Miami on Feb. 25. “I don't think it'll go past two,” said Liston. “It better not go past three.” Liston explained that he has bet a friend a wristwatch that he will silence the challenger in three rounds. The champion, looking cheer- ful and fit, also explained why he was training in Las Vegas in- stead of Miami. “I don't like to hear that loudmouth,” he said, referring to Clay. “If I was in Florida I'd hear it.” Liston added that a forecast of bad weather kept him from training in Denver, his home. Liston's last two fights have not totaled six minutes because he knocked out the former champion, Floyd Patterson, in less than three minutes each time. Asked if this lack of fight time bothered him, Liston said, “No, I'm going to try to fight about a minute and four seconds.” Turning serious, he said: “I'm going to train harder for Clay than I did for Patterson. I don't want him to catch me short. I want to catch him short.” A questioner pointed out that Clay has the reputation for being fast. “That's what they say about all of them. It looks like I'm just a little bit faster,” said Liston.

14-> BANKS STUDYING EXPANSION MOVES; But Few Are Acting to Set Up Holding Companies
New York bankers are buzzing about bank holding companies. Everyone is talking about them. Whether anyone is doing anything is something else. “We're not particularly intrigued by them at the moment. Our interest is academic,” commented a high‐ranking officer of a multibillion‐dollar bank with a large branch system. An executive of another bank in the same class says: “We haven't been talking to any banks about it. We have been looking into it. I won't guarantee we won't talk to one tomorrow ” The head of still another bank here has put out some feelers. But the project hasn't gotten very far. A Long Island bank says it would be willing to join a holding company but hasn't been invited . Another bank on the island might be interested in forming a holding company but hasn't really looked into it. The Franklin National Bank, the largest on Long Island, says it is too busy opening new branches in New York City to be interested in a holding company. It must be remembered that coyness is the watchword. No banker is likely to express on the record an interest in forming a holding company before he has lined un other banks. Premature disclosure can lead to embarrassment if the deal falls through. It can also be an invitation to a competitor to get busy. A holding company is a corporation whose principal business is owning the stock of other companies. In banking the holding company has been a rarity in the East compared with other regions. In New York State there is only one statewide bank holding company, the Buffalo‐based Marine Midland Corporation. It controls 11 banks with 192 offices in 113 communities. Were an existing bank to sponsor a holding company, the mechanism would probably be as follows: The company would be incorporated. It would exchange its own shares of stock for those of the constituent banks, thereby acquiring control of the banks. The sponsoring bank presumably would control the holding company. Additional holding company sh?res could be offered to the public to swell the group's resources. Marine Midland. for exammple, is a publicly held corporation whose stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Several factors make holding companies a topical subject now: The tax bill Congress is likely to pass soon would repeal the present 2 per cent penalty tax on the filing of consolidated tax returns by holding companies. An extra 2 per cent on the earnings of a big bank comes to a lot of money — and maybe a lot of unhappy shareholders. ¶A Jan. 21 invitation by Oren Root. New York State's Superintendent of Banks, for the formation of “moderate size” holding companies, “with or without a large New York City bank as an anchor.” The Superintendent and the Federal Reserve Board must approve the establishment of bank holding companies. ¶Dim prospects that the State Legislature, at least in 1964, will ease geographic restrictions on a bank's opening branches or merging with another bank. That leaves the holding company as the only way a bank can hurdle the borders of its banking district. The state is divided into nine such districts. These would seem to be good reasons for an expansionminded bank to be looking into forming a holding company. Yet, the bankers are moving slowly. One reason is a widespread concern that either the Reserve Board or the Justice Department's antitrust division will object. Inn 1962 the seven‐man Reserve Board unanimously turned down a bid by the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, one of the biggest banks here, to join forces with six of the largest upstate banks. Since then the Supreme Court has held that banking is subject to the Clayton Antitrust Act. Federal trust busters are busy pursuing cases that will clarify the implications of that decision. Bankers who have given even a little thought to the subject — and many fall into that category — say that to navigate the regulatory and antitrust shoals safely, a proposed holding company should consist of banks that play a secondary or lesser role in their respective areas. There is considerable apprehension that a giant bank with many branches, such as the Chase Manhattan or the First National City, just couldn't get to first base with a holding company proposal. A $150 million bank would seem mighty small stacked up against either of those $12 billion institutions, so small, some bankers say, it might not pay to acquire it through a holding company. Yet, it is feared, $150 million might not look so small to government officials. “We'd have to go to Washington and get some indication 0n advance,” commented one banker. Suffolk Tempting For an expansion‐minded bank that would be the anchor, the holding company could be a device for entering markets that now are out of bounds. Fast‐growing Suffolk County on Long Island is one such market that sorely tempts Manhattan's banking leaders. Others are the industrial cities from Albany to Buffalo. What's in it for the suburban and upstate banks ? They would retain their separate existence as banks and a limited measure of autonomy. A holding company would be foolish to strip a subsidiary bank of its identity because that would drive some customers to other local banks. The subsidiary banks would stand to gain the services of a New York City bank's talented experts on everything from savings accounts to trusts to foreign exchange. There could well be economies in the use of automation equipment and in supervisory payroll costs. New York City banks have strong international departments. Able to fall back on them, an upstate bank might be able to take away some export‐import financing business from a local competitor. Finally, there is the big sweetener, the realization today of some of tomorrow's fruits: the premium. The bank going into a holding company expects to get, and the holding company expects to give, a favorable stock exchange ratio. The appreciation to the shareholders, it might be said, is the reward for surrendering independence.

PITTSBURGH, March 16 (AP)—Earl Belle, a financier who fled the United States five years ago, pleaded not guilty to multiple fraud charges. Mr. Belle, who returned to this country last December from a self‐imposed exile in Brazil, entered his plea through an attorney at an arraignment in United States District Court.

ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., Feb 26—New Jersey bankers were urged today to promote the economic health of their business communities through installment‐lending to small businesses. William H.

22-> Success of Talks Doubted
ADDIS ABABA, March 27— It is considered unlikely that any effective compromise will emerge from the discussions in Khartoum, on the EthiopianSonmali border dispute. The positions of the two countries are completeiy opposed. Ethiopia is prepared to consider only the exact demarcation of her southern border with Somalia. Somalia is not concerned with boundary revision, but with sweeping territorial claims against Ogaden, a vast and arid waste populated almost entirely by Somali nomads. Ever since Somali became an independent republic in 1960, she has demanded the unification of all Somali ‐ inhabited areas. These embrace much of northern Kenya, all French Somaliland, and Ogaden. Somali attacks on police posts and conveys along the Ethiopian border were followed last month by a series of battles between regular troops of both sides. The Organization of African Unity persuaded the two countries to accept a cease‐fire, and the present talks are the first direct attempt for nearly a year to discuss the problems.

23-> Sunday Sports Bill Is Signed; LAW NO ALLOWS A 1:05 P.M. START; Yankees and Mets Move Up Game Time for Twin Bills on Sundays to 1:30
ALBANY, March 17—Governor Rockefeller today signed into law a bill permitting sports events to start at 1:05 P.M. instead of 2 P.M. on Sundays. With enactment of the measure, the New York Yankees and New York Mets announced that their Sunday starting times for double‐headers would be 1:30 P.M. The Yanks also will play their single games at 1:30, the Mets at 2 P.M. An aide to the Governor said Rockefeller had agreed to move up the starting times of sports and other entertainment because of a growth of interest in Sunday games in recent years. New York was one of only three states that had continued to insist on the 2 o'clock starting time. In 1959, the Governor had vetoed a bill authorizing the change to 1:05, saying that it would have “disturbed the settled balance of interests” involved in the use of the day. Observance of the 2 o'clock time was based on blue laws that date from the last century. The new time takes into account bavball double‐headers that have lasted into the evening, and the longer trip fans will have to make to Shea Stadium, the new home of the Mets in Flushing Meadow, Queens.

28-> Bank Ban on Smoking Ignites a Mild Battle; Holders of Franklin Outvote Cigarette Defender, 250–1
GARDEN CITY, N. Y., Jan. 31 —A beautiful friendship was briefly interrupted here today at the annual stockholders’ meeting of the Franklin National Bank. Arthur T. Roth, the energetic chairman of the Franklin National, is an admirer of Lewis D. Gilbert. Mr. Gilbert, who doesn't have too many corporate chairmen as admirers, also admires Mr. Roth. Today, however, Mr. Gilbert warmly attacked Mr. Roth's recent edict that Franklin National's 1,150 employes must withdraw to the washrooms if they wish to smoke during working hours. Mr. Roth explained his position at length, and finally, on a voice vote, Mr. Gilbert turned out to be a minority of one in a gathering of more than 250 stockholders at the Garden City Hotel. Mr. Roth told the stockholders that he agreed heartily with Mr. Gilbert's declaration that it would be a wicked invasion of a citizen's individual rights to tell him he couldn't smoke. But the executive made the distinction that he wasn't telling anyone he couldn't smoke. He said that his ban, issued on Dec. 10 last year. meant that a smoker could not indulge the habit while he was actively en₭gaged in the Franklin National Bank's business. Mr. Roth assured the stockholders that the decision to invoke the no‐smoking ban was reached only after careful consultation with the Long Island bank's 11 directors and senior officers. He said he calculated that the ban would save the bank $100,000 a year in sickleave pay, cleaning costs and expenses for replacing broken ash trays and repairing burnt furniture. Mr. Gilbert's own cigarette—a filter‐tip Kent—obviously served him more as a battle flag, as he debated Mr. Roth, than as a source of gratification. An onlooker might have thought that he had never smoked three or four cigarettes in his life before the two he lit today. Once the disagreement over whether the nonsmoking rule was a contribution to banking efficiency or a massive invasion of privacy was ended, Mr. Roth and Mr. Gilbert were the best of friends again. Mr. Roth told the stockholders that several headings in the annual report should be credited to Mr. Gilbert. Mr. Gilbert then asked for the floor and spoke at length on the topic of what a remarkably capable corporate executive Mr. Roth is. Into this flood of goodwill Mr. Roth dropped the fact that the Franklin National Bank will not earn as much money in 1964 as it earned in 1963. This bit of bad news did not appear to make any noticeable splash with the shareholders. Mr. Roth's estimate was that 1964 profits would be $2.70 a share, down from $2.85 a share in. 1963. He added that he “hoped” earnings would rise to $3 a share in 1965. He attributed the drop in earnings expected this year to expenses involved in Franklin National's entry into New York. The bank plans to open 25 New York City branches over five years, With five set for this year. The first three—one at Madison Avenue and 48th Street, another at Hanover Square, near Wall Street, and the third in Brooklyn—are scheduled to open for business on May 11. Mr. Roth said that the bank now estimated that the cost of entering New York City would reach $4 million, against an original estimate of $3 million. Expenses for the new offices in New York in 1964 will amount to about 44 cents a share, against 17 cents a share set aside in 1963, he said. Next year, expenses are again expected to be about 44 cents, but they will drop sharply in 1965. The executive said that he expected that over the next seven years the opening of New York City branches would yield the bank “a return that is four times the cost. From New York City, we should earn $16 million” He assured the shareholders that the bank had no plans during the next several years for selling additional common shares to support its expansion program. He made no mention of additional preferred stock or capital debt. Mr. Roth assured the shareholders that Franklin National had not suffered any losses as a result of the recent bankruptcy of the Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Company. In answer to a shareholder's question, he said that in December the bank did have a loan outstanding to a finance company that had lent money on warehouse receipts of Allied Crude. “We lent to the finance company that lent the money to Allied,” he said. The finance company, at the bank's request has paid off the loan, he added.

CHATTANOOGA, Jan. 17—James R.

Wilson on Monday. Mr. Hoffa flew to his home in Detroit tonight, saying he would return on Sunday. The United States Court of Appeals at Cincinnati refused today to delay the trial. The court, however, granted a motion on behalf of one of the defendants in the case, Lawrence Medlin, a Nashville merchant, to shift his case back to Nashville. As a result, Mr. Hoffa will stand trial here with five co‐defendants instead of six. All are accused of trying to influence the jury in Mr. Hoffa's trial in Nashville last year on Federal charges of accepting money from an employer whose workers he represents as a union official. A mistrial was declared when the jury could not agree. Co‐defendants with Mr. Hoffa, in addition to Mr. Medlin, are Allen Dorfman, a Chicago insurance man; Nicholas J. Tweel, a businessman from Huntington, W. Va.; Larry Campbell, a business agent with Mr. Hoffa's home local, 299; Thomas E.

CLIFTON, N.

The optimism was sparked by word that the House Agriculture Committee had approved a bill allowing sale of the acreage to Clifton. The bill must be approved by a Senate committee before Congress can act on it. “We are looking forward to having Uncle Sam get off our back,” Mayor Ira Schoem said. “The station has been here for more than 60 years. We like them, but we wish they'd go elsewhere.” The quarantine station has been operated by the Department of Agriculture in the Athenia section of Clifton since May, 1900..It serves as a sort of Ellis Island for 95 per cent of the imported cattle, sheep and assorted wildlife. Mr. Schoem said, “We are enough to know that this will not happen too quickly. It's going to take time but we are optimistic about the prospects.”

37-> BALTIMORE LOSES FORD'S THEATER; 92‐Year‐Old Landmark to Make Way for a Garage
BALTIMORE, Feb. 2—Ford's Theater, once a favorite tryout stage for Broadway producers. ended its career last night at the age of 92. An overflow audience of 1,800 turned out to bid it farewell before workmen begin dismantling the structure tomorrow to make way for a parking garage. When the curtain rang down on “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,” the audience stood and sang “AuldLang Syne.” Mr. and Mrs. Morris Mechanic. the owners of Ford's, held a black‐tie party in the lobby in final tribute. Gov. J. Millard Tawes and Mayor Theodore R. McKeldin joined other officials at a special ceremony organized by Dorothy Lamour, the actress, who is a member of the city's Civil Center Commission. Speaking between acts to the audience, the Mayor said he refused to say farewell and promised a rebirth of the theater when the owners of Ford's build anew within a year. There is little doubt, though, that live theater here has failed in recent years to draw the audiences that it did in the past. Motion pictures and television have taken their toll. But theatergoers came out last night. Ticket‐holders began amming the lobby shortly before show time. Several hundred onlookers stood outside to watch the fashionable arrivals. When the curtain went up many persons were still trickling In, including Thomas B. finan, the state's Attorney General. “You should get an injuntion to stop the show until we get inside,” someone told Mr. Finan lightheartedly. Jerry Lester, Arnold Stang, Paul Hartman and Edward Everett Horton had little trouble winning laughs and applause with their performances. It was more like a first night than a kake. During intermission, Helen Menken, president of the American Theater Wing, recalled how she had made her debut at the age of 5 on Ford's stage. She and others paid tribute to Mr. and Mrs. Mechanic for keeping theater alive despite tte difficulties. Historically, the boards at Ford's bear the footprints of theater in this country. The playhouse was opened in 1571 by John T. Ford, whose Ford's Theater in Washington was closed by the Government a ter President Lincoln was assassinated there in 1865. The first production was. Shakespeare's “As You Like It” with James W. Wallack. Gi1hert and Sullivan's “H.M.S. Pinafore” made its United States debut on Ford's stage. Most of the eminent United States actor s of the last century took curtain calls there. David Belasco the producer, considered it unlucky to open his plays anywhere else. Not surprisingly, a small group of people arrived after last night's performance to attempt to strip the old theater of souvenirs. One man who collects door handles from landmarks stood outside with a screwdriver. But, a special detail of policemen were sent inside to clear the uninvited guests so that the party could begin.

39-> Hodges to Review 2 Disputed Rulings By Ship Aid Board
Secretary of Commerce Luther H. Hodges announced yesterday that he would review two controversial rulings by the Maritime Subsidy Board. The two rulings, which were to have gone into effect today, center on the question of competition between subsidized and unsubsidized ship operations over a domestic route. By law, Federal ship subsidies are not available to vessels engaged in domestic trade. The two cases involve States Steamship Company and Matson Navigation Company onthe West Coast‐to‐Hawaii run, and Grace Line and American Export and Isbrandtsen Lines on the Puerto Rico run on the East Coast. In the case of States Steamship, the Maritime Subsidy Board overruled its hearing examiner and decided that States, a subsidized operator, could increase its calls at Hawaiian ports from 13 to 26 a year. In that decision the board found that Matson, the unsubsidized domestic carrier, had a predominant, “almost monopolistic” position in the California‐Hawaii trade. The ruling was appealed by Matson, which pointed out that the Government was in effect permitting a federally supported enterprise to encroach on a private operation. In the second case, the board turned down Grace Line on an application to make calls at Puerto Rico with its subsidized containership service between New York and Venezuela. Grace appealed the ruling. In explaining its ruling in the Grace Line case the board said the line's plan would have “overtonnaged” the Puerto Rico trade and would “seriously affect existing domestic carriers.” However, the board authorized Grace Line to make six calls a year at Puerto Rico, to be made by cruise ships in subsidized service between New York and ports in the Caribbean and South America.

40-> JEWS ASK U.S. AID IN VISITING SHRINE; Rabbi Seeks Aid in Getting Access to Jordan
LAKEWOOD, N. J., Feb. 3 —The head of the largest organization of Orthodox rabbis in the country appealed to President Johnson tonight to use his influence in the United Nations to get permission for Jews to worship at the Wailing Wall in the old section of Jerusalem occupied bv Jordan. Specifically, Rabbi Abraham N. AvRutick, president of the Rabbinical Council of America, urged both the Federal Government and the United Nations to enforce a provision in the Jordan‐Israel armistice agreement “which affirms the Jewish right to access to the Wailig Wall, and to all sacred Jewish sites and shrines in old Jerusalem.” The rabbi spoke at the opening of the council's annual religious convocation, at the Brunswick Hotel. The council has a membership of 850 Orthodox rabbis serving 1.5 million persons. Rabbi AvRutick lauded Pope Paul's recent pilgrimage to sacred Christian shrines in Israel and Jordan and added: “We hope that this would have had an enlightening influence on those who have denied this right to Jewish pilgrims.” The rabbi also cited the Israeli practice of permitting Christians to go through the Mandelbaum Gate on sacred Christian holidays to visit holy sites in Jordan. Rabbi AvRutick voiced regret that Jews were denied the same privilege in Jordan. He listed various sacred Jewish religious shrines, adding that “no Jew has been permitted to visit the graveside of his parents on the Mount of Olives in old Jerusalem.”

41-> Success Story: Potential Ruin Is Turned to Boom; Kentuckian Sells a Chicken Franchise Business for $2 Million Bonanza
LOUISVILLE, Ky., March 21 —Nine years ago Harland Sanders was the 65‐year‐old operator of a successful motel and restaurant on U. S. 25 in Corbin, Ky. Then came word that seemed to him to spell ruin. The proposed location of Interstate 75, the Cincinnati‐toKnoxville route, would miss Corbin and the Sanders Court and cafe by seven miles. This spurred Mr. Sanders to concentrate on a sideline of his, a patented process for quickcooking chicken under pressure with a blend of 11 spices and herbs. Attired in a white suit, sporting a mustache and goatee and styling himself a “Kentucky colonel,” Mr. Sanders toured the country selling franchises td his cooking process and seasoning. With his flair for salesmanship, the colonel's product took, and today more than 900 restaurants in the United States, Canada, England and Japan sell his “Kentucky fried chicken —it's finger‐lickin’good." Recently Mr. Sanders, whose smiling face is produced on carry‐out buckets, billboards, and other advertisements halfway across the world, sold his venture—for $2 million. Kentucky Fried Chicken, Inc., wjth headquarters in nearby Shelbyville, Ky., was sold to a corporation formed by John Young Brown Jr., Louisville; Lee Cummings, Anchorage, Ky.; Jack Massey, Nashville, Tenn.; Kenny King, Cleveland, and Pete Harmon, Salt Lake City. Mr. Harmon's restaurant in Salt Lake City was the first to buy a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise. Name to Remain But Mr. Sanders, who last year logged more than 200,000 miles promoting his business, remains associated with the company that he said made him $2,000 a day last year. The name of the venture is still the same and Mr. Sanders, now 74 years old, has a lifetime contract for publicity work at $40,000 a year. In addition to continuing to franchise the cooking and seasoning process and selling specialized restaurant supplies, the new owners plan to help finance the construction of new restaurants, which Mr. Sanders did not do. As to the spices and herbs that go into the fast‐cooking process, Mr. Sanders says they are “found on just about everybody's shelf.” But the recipe, like the ingredients of CocaCola, are a secret. The ingredients were used on 18 million chickens, last year Mr. Sanders said. This year he expects the total to reach 24 million. Mr. Sanders moved his business headquarters from Corbin to Shelbyville, 30 miles east of Louisville, in 1960, when business demanded better air‐connections and transportation facilities for shipment of his spices, carry‐out cartons, advertising materials and pressure cookers.

43-> New State Theater At Lincoln Center Ready in a Month
The $19.3 million New York State Theater at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts will open one month from today — complete, on schedule and with more leg room than most theaters in the country. The 2,729‐seat theater, de‐signed by Philip Johnson, willbe the home of two residentcompanies — the Music Theater of Lincoln Center and the New York City Ballet. The ballet company's dancers and officers are moving in today. George Balanchine, director, intends to lead a class in a top‐floor rehearsal room beginning at noon. The state theater's emphasis will be mostly on dance, operetta and musical comedy. However, performing‐arts troupes, like Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company, will also be presented. The building is the second completed at the center. It is on the south side of Lincoln Center Plaza, at Broadway and 64th Street. It faces Philharmonic Hall, which was opened in September, 1962, before its completion. The Music Theater and the City Ballet will take part in the opening night program, which has not yet been announced. Among the speakers on that occasion will be Governor Rockefeller, Lieut. Gov. Malcolm Wilson; Robert Moses, president of the New York World's Fair Corporation, and John D. Rockefeller 3d and William Schuman, the center's board chairman and president, respectively. The following night, the ballet company, moving to Lincoln Center after 35 seasons at the City Center, will present “A Midsummer Night's Dream.” will continue at the theater through May 17. The ballet will keep its customary $4.95 top price. Tickets for the Music Theater will cost from $1.50 to $6. The building has Continental seating—no aisles—for 1,044 persons in the orchestra of the horseshoe‐shape auditorium. The rows in the orchestra are 40 inches apart. This provides 8 to 11 inches more leg room than is available in theaters with conventional seating. Five horseshoe‐shape shallow balconies almost encircle the auditorium. The rows in the balconies are 36 inches apart. Most of the seats are within 100 feet of the stage. The audience will enter the orchestra through five doors on each side of the auditorium and walk between the rows of seats to their places. The seating arrangement in the orchestra, according to center officials, intensifies the traditional theater problem of what to do about latecomers. Those with center locations will disrupt theatergoers who come on time in the long walk between rows to their seats. “This is a tough problem,” Edgar B. Young, executive vice president of the center, said. “At the ballet, we will follow the practice of no seating in the orchestra after the curtain rises until the first intermission. I anticipate that this willbe followed for the other attractions in the theater.” The theater is booked through the end of 1965. Other engagements include: May 18‐June 7, Royal Shakespeare Company in “King Lear” and “The Comedy of Errors”; June 9‐28, Bayanihan Philippine Dance Company; July 6‐Aug. 8, Music Theater with “The King and I”; Aug. 17‐Sept. 19, Music Theater with “The Merry Widow”; Sept. 21‐Nov. 8, New York City Ballet; Nov. 10‐15, Chilean National Ballet; Nov. 28‐Dec. 6, Schiller Theater, and Dec. (for 11 weeks), New York City Ballet. The Metropolitan Opera's national company will be among the attractions next year. Others will be the American Ballet Theater and the San Francisco Ballet. Center officials hope that the new theater, unlike Philharmonic Hall, will not have major acoustics problems. “We have our fingers crossed,” Mr. Johnson said. “It looks hopeful.” He added, “It is finally and ultimately in the laps of the gods.” One of the building's features is its 60 foot by 200 foot promenade on the first ring level. It will be used not only for strolling, but also for receptions and state and civic luncheons and dinners. Six hundred diners could be accommodated. The promenade will also have a long bar, where liquor and soft drinks can be purchased during intermissions. To the west of the theater is the new Metropolitan Opera House, which is scheduled to open in 1966. The steel framework and part of the facade have been put up. Also under construction at the center are the Vivian Beaumont Theater and the LibraryMuseum of the Performing Arts. Part of the exterior of both buildings, due to open early next year, has been completed. The Juilliard Building is due to open in 1967. Construction will start in the summer of 1965. The New York State Theater was financed largely by the state, which made $15 million available as part of its World's Fair participation. The city provided $2.15 million for construction, and the remainder came from the centers contributed funds.

44-> Punishing Treatment; LAW, LIBERTY AND PSYCHIATRY: An Inquiry Into the Social Uses of Mental Health Practices. By Thom­as S. Szasz, M.D. 281 pp. New York: The Macmillan Company. $7.50.
ARISTOTLE noticed how punishment was a sort of m icine. Dr. Thomas S. Szasz shows how the medicine administered in psychiatric institutions is a sort of punishment, and punishment of the worst sort. Here is a documented thesis that the 250,000 human beings, who each year enter our mental hospitals, are systematically shorn of most of their Constitutional rights and treated in ways to strike dread into hardened criminals. The author, himself a psychoanalyst and professor of psychiatry at State University of New York Medical Center, declares psychiatry to be a new form of social engineering—gravely dangerous where coercive. None of the criticism Dr. Szasz levels at institutional psychiatry has to do with Freud. This bold and iconoclastic work takes up most of the faults committed in the name of mental illness, and lays down short‐run and long‐run solu‐ tions. In the process, not even the famed Durham insanity ruling is left standing—the author seeing small gain for anyone in tossing a culprit into a looney bin instead of in the jug. What emerges is an informed, inspired credo of fair treatment for all persons charged with being mentally ill. No. such person should ever be involuntarily confined (not for pseudo‐criminal behavior; not for being only “dangerous” to himself or others; not for otherwise deviating from ethical, political, social or sexual norms), but if ever, never without a prior court hearing with right to legal counsel, access to psychiatric experts, and a jury. No person should ever be led to incriminate himself through divulgence of his communications to psychiatrists in the hire of the state. No person should ever be “punished” under the guise of being “treated.” All persons should be humanely treated while imprisoned for their crimes—whether done by reason of insanity, mental illness, spite, anger, or the wish to deny, circumvent or overthrow the system. Thus to state what is wanted is pitiably far from what obtains. It needs reminding that un‐ *The Durham ruling is that an accused is not criminally responsible if his unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental defect. til recently neither our (liberal) criminal‐law tradition nor our (backward) prison‐administration philosophy ever had good excuse to invent and program such this‐is‐going‐to‐hurt‐memore‐than‐it‐hurts‐you “treatments” as electric shock, lobotomy and indeterminate (i.e., until dead or “cured”) sentences for persons found involved in “potentially” criminal, deviant or otherwise obnoxious behavior. As the author points out, the Devil was the excuse for our witch‐hunting forebears. The excuse for institutional psychiatry has been that it is really the best medicine available, really in the best interests of the “patient,” and really in another and high (i.e., therapeutic and scientific) league altogether than barbaric old vindictive criminal punishment. Dr. Szasz is even more alarmed over the Orwellian (even Buchenwaldian) dimensions of this psychiatric double‐think, than over the many concrete wrongs he uncovers in this country's treatment of the confined “mentally ill.” Dr. Szasz warns of psychiatric authoritarianism concealed in the spreading fear that we are plagued by mental illness. From that fear stems the danger that we may be half‐wittingly sowing the seeds for a bumper crop of new “inferior” beings—demi‐criminals who may in reasonably good conscience be stripped of their human rights and mowed down into a sort of sub‐group: they cannot be harmed (or blamed!) because they have no recognizable will, no mind to speak of, and need be put somewhere under the “best” possible care. Although most patients, adults and children alike, are institutionalized by their loved ones, there are cases too where war, politics and religion have sent individuals to institutions. As Dr. Szasz suggests, it's a marvelous way of getting rid of trouble‐makers. It can be speedier and surer than criminal prosecutions in a land where judges keep vigil over due process for accused criminals, but only nod or stare unseeing when men in white escort persons “certified” mentally ill behind tall walls.

46-> LIQUOR INDUSTRY OPPOSES CHANGE; Calls Extension of Outlets Threat to Temperance
The liquor industry responded swiftly yesterday in denouncing recommendations by the Moreland Act Commission for the removal of some restrictions on the sale of bottled alcoholic beverages. The bitterness of the response presaged a concerted effort by the liquor industry to convince state legislators to reject the recommendations. However, State Senator John J. Marchi, chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee for the Study of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, said he thought that a number of the recommendations sounded “excellent.” On the other hand, the Staten Island Republican added, some of them will have to be scrutinized carefully by the Legislature. The commission's recommendation that department stores be allowed to sell liquor in their suburban branches was welcomed as a “step forward” by David L. Yunich, president of Macy's. Mr. Yunich rejected the contention that allowing branches of department stores to sell bottled spirits would put local liquor stores out of business. He said the fact that department store branches sold drugs and hardware had not affected the business of local drugstores or hardware stores. Bernard B Zients, executive head of Gimbels, said he thought the recommendation was “a fair one for big stores” that sold a great many products. Thomas J. Donovan, president of Licensed Beverage Industries, Inc., the liquor industry's public relations arm, called the Moreland Commission's recommendations “unfortunate.” Referring to the recommendation that liquor sales be extended to such places as supermarkets and drugstores, Mr. Donovan asserted: “Experience has demonstrated that the public interest and the maintenance of temperance and moderation absolutely require some limitation of the number and character of outlets retailing distilled spirits. “Most importantly, experience has demonstrated the constructive importance and soundness of the provision of the New York law that permits the sales of distilled spirits and wines only in outlets devoted exclusively to the sale of such commodities.” Mr. Donovan said that the sale of liquor in supermarkets would unduly expose minors to bottled spirits. He added that stores devoted exclusively to liquor could better control sales to young people and to intoxicated persons. Lester Bandel, chairman of the Save Our Stores Committee and head of the Pioneer Wine and Liquor Company, a package store here, charged that the recommendations were dictated by “the large money groups.” “But I don't think they're going to get this,” he added. ““We'll go to Albany to protest.” Oscar A. Bloustein, executive director of the Metropolitan Package Stores Association, declined to comment pending study of the commission's recommendations. However, Mr. Bloustein has stated previously that allowing large stores like Macy's to sell liquor in suburban outlets would lead to carload buying that would force many neighborhood stores out of business. Senator Marchi said his committee's report on liquor control would not be ready until March. But he said that some of the commission's recommendations appeared to be similar “with our own thinking.“ One of the recommendations that he approved was the automatic renewal of liquor licenses. But he expressed some doubt that the Legislature would go along with the recommendation on chain‐store operations. He added, however, that some compromise might be reached.

47-> Opera: ‘Katya Kabanova’; Janacek Work in Local Premiere at Juilliard
OPERAS by Leos Janacek have been making the rounds of the European opera houses, but in the United States they are pretty much an unknown quantity. Last night, the Czech composer's “Katya Kabanova” was staged by the Juilliard Opera Theater, and it was the first time the opera was heard in this city. It was composed in 1921, seven years before Janacek's death, and if nothing else the libretto is modern. Today, stories about son ‐ eating mothers are a dime a dozen. What would we do without our Freud? But in 1921 “Katya Kabanova,” which is an example of psychological verismo, must have come as a shocker. Compare Marfa Kabanova with Mamma Lucia in “Cavalleria Rusticana!” ?We have a domineering mother, a weak son, an unfaithful wife who repents and commits suicide. To this, Janacek set a rather puzzling score. It is, on the whole, postromantic. But some of the harmonies are modern, especially those in the first scene of the third act. The orchestration is thick‐sounding, as though it had been hewed from oak with an ax. There are sections frankly folklike, such as Vanya's serenade, and quasi‐folk, such as the lovely ending of the second act. In short, “Katya Kabanova” is the product of an eclectic musical mind. But it is a strong and altogether individual mind. Janacek aimed for a fusion of words, action and music. He dropped much of the standard operatic apparatus, and a good deal of the vocal line is declamatory. Occasionally, the orchestra comes up with gorgeous snatches of melody but never follows through. Perhaps further acquaintance with the opera will relate those melodic quotations to other elements in the score. Those who know the opera in the original Czech assure this writer that “Katya Kabanova” resists translation. Janacek. they say, was master of a certain type of rhythmic declamation that had a music KATYA KABANOVA, opera in three acts by Leos Janacek, libretto adapted by the composer from Ostrovsky's play “The Storm.” English version by Norman Tucker.

Presented by the Juilliard Opera Theater, with the Juilliard Orchestra. At the Juilliard School of Music.

This cannot be captured (they say); it is too personal and too national. Be that as it may, the opera nevertheless makes an impact, and it has moments of piercing sadness and sweetness that are not easily forgotten. It is not successful all the way through, and some sections suggest mere note ‐ spinning. Nevertheless, the work is well worth hearing. It certainly has something to say arid says it with individuality—eclecticism and all. Last night's was a student performance, but there was nothing studentish about it. Sets by Ming Cho Lee and costumes by Patton Campbell were thoroughly professional, and so was Christopher West's direction. The singers were uniformly good, and they even managed to articulate clearly the Norman Tucker translation. • “Katya Kabanova” is not an opera with big arias and high notes, and thus the full potential of the singers remains to be seen. Of the principals, Lorna Haywood in the title role displayed a big voice and complete confidence. Boris, her lover, was sung by Alexander Yancy. He has an interesting voice—a tenor with a baritonal sound, rather husky but not unattractive in timbre. Marilyn Zschau was an attractive soubrette and Bonnie Godfrey, a menacing Marfa. A fine bit was also turned in by Grayson Hirst as Vanya. All deserve credit, and so does Frederic Waldman, who led the Juilliard players through a thoroughly competent reading of the score.

48-> PROFIT MARK SET BY FOOD COMPANY
The Consolidated Foods Cor­poration set records for sales and earnings in the 12 and 24 weeks ended Dec. 14, the com­pany reported yesterday. For the second quarter, the net earnings totaled $2,655,249, equal to 54 cents a share, on sales of $145,028,259. In the corresponding period of the pre­ceding year the net was $2,­218,326, or 46 cents a share, on sales of $132,061,704. Net earnings of the 24 weeks rose 21 per cent to $5,161,075 from $4,272,412 earned in the l preceding year's period. The earnings were equal to $1.06 and 89 cents a share. William Howlett, president, said "this marks the 10th con­secutive year in which operating earnings for the 24‐week period have shown increases over the same period of the preceding year, both in dollar amount. and in earnings a share. It is noteworthy that most of our units are consistently showing sales and operating earnings in­creases over year‐earlier per­iods." The Jim Walter Corporation for the quarter ended Nov. 30, showed a sharp increase in con­solidated earnings above the corresponding period of the for­mer year, the report disclosed yesterday. Consolidated net income was $1,001,041, equal to 51 cents a share, on 1,949,721 common shares. This was almost dou­ble the $529,532, or 27 cents a share, for the November quar­ter of the preceding year. The results included the com­pany's share in earnings of the Celotex Corporation, which is 61.3 per cent‐owned by Jim Walter. Excluding this CeIotex share of interest, Jim Walter's earnings alone were 33 cents for the 1963 period compared with 23 cents a year earlier. The Celotex Corporation also showed a substantial gain in revenues and earnings for the November quarter. Net profit was $603,511, or 53 cents a share, on 1,018,651 common shares outstanding. This com­pares with $188,721, or 12 cents a common share, earned in the November quarter of 1962. Rev­enues increased to $29,124,106 from $23,539,571.

49-> CLAIMS PILING UP FOR SHIP INSURERS
Six major ship losses within a two‐month period may result in claims totaling almost $6,000,000 against the Ameri­can Hull Insurance Syndicate, Clifford G. Cornwell, the syndi­cate chairman, reported yes­terday. The losses, involving vessels of three nations, reflect the in­ternational scope of the syndi­cate's operation, Mr. Cornwell noted. The syndicate, founded in 1920, insures almost 3,000 commercial vessels trading throughout the world. Mr. Cornwell said that the explosion aboard the American tanker San Jacinto on March 26 off the Virginia Capes was the most recent major loss sus­tained by the insurers since carly February. During the whole of last year the institute handled 28 major losses, six of which resulted in the total loss of vessels. Two of this year's casualties resulted in the loss of the ships, Mr. Cornwell reported. On Feb. 29 the Liberian‐flag tanker Amphialos split in half during heavy weather in the North Atlantic. The forward section sank almost immediate­ly and the stern section sank four days later while being towed to port. On March 16 the United States‐flag tanker Bunker Hill exploded and sank in Puget Sound, Wash., with the loss of five lives. In early February the Norwegian freighter Terrier went aground during a gale in the Gulf of Finland and could not be refloated for a month, Mr. Cornwell said. On Feb. 7 the Norwegian tanker Sigdal struck a rocky ledge in the East River, opened a 200‐foot gap in her bottom and lost much of her cargo of oil. On March 16, the Norwe­gian ore‐oil carrier Cuyahoga was stranded on the coast of Peru. Mr. Cornwell pointedout that strandings often resulted not only in extensive bottom dam­age, but also in serious damage to propellers, shafts and ma­chinery. While the casualties empha­sized the need for setting aside adequate reserves for total losses, Mr. Cornwell said, pre­mium levels have been depressed “to marginal and even,ubmar­ginal levels” by international competition. .

50-> LIGHT CAST ON DANCE BY ‘THE CHEQUER'D SHADE’
A LITTLE book called “The Chequer'd Shade” (an Oxford paperback) deserves readers it will probably never get. It is subtitled “Reflections on Obscurity in Poetry,” and its author, John Press, discusses the subject thoroughly. This sounds frightening and could make for rather deadly, if instructive, reading, but it does not. One reason it is lively is that Mr. Press has an easy style and wit of his own; another is that he has quoted other critics and commentators generously and in his choices has inclined to those who express themselves directly and clearly. Although Mr. Press hews closely to the given subject at all times, much of the comment and common sense in the book is as applicable to one art as to another. Which brings us to the dance. What about the profusion, confusion or obscurity often found in the dances of inexperienced choreographers, especially young ones? Is the fault always ours if we do not get the point or do not feel like picking our way through mazes of symbols or flurries of acrobatics in search of meaning ? See what Louis MacNeice in his maturity had to say about one of his early poems: [It is] “full of mythological tags, halfdigested new ideas and conceits put in for the hell of it ...[It] was not, in the ordinary sense, fake; it sprang from an only too genuine emotion . . . The fault of such a poem lies not in its feeling but in its technique. For technique begins in the junkshop, in a process—conscious or unconscious—of sorting out. Free association, when it makes literature, isn't as free as it may look.” Substitute the word “dance” for “poem” and “choreography” for “literature” and see if the quotation is not applicable to dance works. Are you one of those who feel that modern abstract ballets such as George Balanchine's “Agon,” “Episodes” and “Move ments for Piano and Orchestra” are not really ballets at all? That they lack feeling, emotion, romance, mystery and so on? Does modern dance disappoint because it accents the angular and wears neither tutus nor toe shoes? Do Martha Graham's dance‐dramas stray too far from prettiness ? Are Alwin Nikolais's creations too impersonal and dehumanized? Read Mr. Press, making the dance for poetry substitutions as you go. “The person who goes to a poem, like the person who goes to church, in order to get from it a certain experience or a particular satisfaction is likely to feel cheated if his hopes are disappointed . . . Inertia, timidity, the desire to cling to familiar certainties and to nestle in comfortable plati tudes . . . are sufficient to account for the irritated bewilderment that many readers experience when confronted with original poetry.” T. S. Eliot writes of “the difficulty caused by the author's having left out something which the reader is used to finding; so that the reader, bewildered, gropes about for what is absent, and puzzles his head for a kind of ‘meaning’ which is not there, and is not meant to be there.” Do you resent the fact that in this century as never before dance has become a thinking man's art? That it demands increased intellectual participation on the part of the watcher as well as the performer? Well, as Miss Graham says, this is the age of the choreog rapher, and he is showing that he respects your intelligence now as he has not always in the past. Once in 1762, Oliver Goldsmith complained about Thomas Gray's odes. James Boswell reported that Goldsmith protested, “We must be historians and learned men before we can understand them.” To which Thomas Davies replied, “And why not? He is not writing to porters or carmen. He is writing to men of knowledge.” Thus it is with the best choreographers of the 20th century. The author of “The Chequer'd Shade” thinks that a bit of well‐organized obscurity in poetry is not necessarily a bad thing. The same thing might be said of its presence in any of the arts, including dance. To make his point Mr. Press writes, “I recall with pleasure Hensley Henson's terse rejoinder to those clergy who were lamenting the difficulty of the Collect for Trinity Sunday: ‘I have little sympathy with this lust for intelligibility'.” We might do well to reflect on our lust for instant perception, prettiness, feeling, featured stars, or whatever it is we insist on finding when we go to see dancing nowadays. The art of the dance is bigger than all of them.

53-> Maritime Industry Is Concerned By Dispute at Academy in Maine
CASTINE, Me., May 7—The shipping industry is disturbed by the eruption of a personality dispute in the administration of the Maine Maritime Academy at Castine. The dispute, resulting in the ousting of the institution's superintendent and the resignation of seven trustees, is over, but scars remain. Ralph A. Leavitt, president of the board oftrustees for more than 20 years, was among those who resigned. He said that he and the six other members had resigned because they believed their usefulness had ended when it became plain that they could not operate the school without interference from Gov.John. H. Reed. The Governor has already named four successor trustees. They have appointed Keldin Nutting, former executive officer of the 450‐student training establishment, as acting superintendent. Mr. Nutting succeeded Frank C. Rodway of Portland, a 38year‐old real estate and insurance man, who been the center of the controversy. Mr. Leavitt said that he did not care to comment further on the causes of the dispute. “There has been enough bloodshed already,” he added. Mr. Rodway earlier in the year and took over Feb. 1 with the support of nine of the 12 trustees. The Maritime Administration of the Department of Commerce provides financial aid to the school and other state maritime academies. The terms of the charter under which this aid is given stipulate that the superintendent should have the reserve rank of captain either in the Navy or the Coast Guard. According to the rules, in the absence of such rank the candidate must other qualifications. The minority trustees, with the backing of Governor Reed, held that Mr. Rodway did not qualify. However, the Maritime Administration accepted him. He holds a master's degree, served with the Coast Guard for three years and has the rank of lieutenant in the Naval Reserve. At one point Governor Reed replaced two of the nine supporters of Mr. Rodway, enlarging the minority trustee bloc to five men. The minority then demanded the superintendent's resignation, but he . At one stage last month, Mr. Rodway granted liberty to 250 of the students then on campus, but most continued to attend classes. Some 200 others were away on the annual cruise on the schoolship State of Maine.

55-> STUDENTS ATTACK 5 MORE TEACHERS; Principal Threatened as School Violence Goes On
Five more teachers were assaulted yesterday and an assistant principal was threatened as pupil violence continued. The attacks, which were carried out with fists, teeth and tomatoes, resulted in the arrest of six pupils and several suspensions from school. Those attacks and an unreported incident on Friday, when a teacher was struck by stones, brought the total number of assaults on teachers in the last 14 school days to 45. The peak number for one day was eight. The only day without an incident was last Monday, when the second school boycott was held. Yesterday's incidents eccurred in or outside five schools. At Benjamin Franklin High School in. Manhattan, Peter D. Golden, a 38‐year‐old teacher of industrial arts, was punched in the face by a 16‐year‐old chronic truant. The boy had been observed entering the school drunk by police, Who arrested him On the teacher's complaint. At Lafayette High School in Brooklyn, Richard Hewett, 35, a social studies teacher, was also struck in the face by a 17‐year‐old boy when he closed a window the student had opened. Later the boy struck the teacher again in the ha1l. The youth also was arrested. In the schoolyard of P.S. 177, Manhattan, a 10‐year‐old girl struck Mrs. Gloria S. Schwartz, 26. The pupil had been admonished to behave herself. At Junior High School 271, Brooklyn, Fred Nauman, a general science teacher, was bitten by a 15‐year‐old student after he had questioned the boy about being late. Two incidents took place involving personnel at Junior High School 120, Manhattan. In the first, a 15‐year‐old boy, who had been in trouble with police for purse‐snatching, was sent to the, general office by a teacher for misbehaving in class. There he “threatened to get” Neal Farber, the assistant principal, according to a Board of Education report. After the school day, William M. Phipps, 32, a music teacher, was pelted with tomatoes thrown by four boys as he walked toward the subway station at 125th Street and Lexington. The four, believed to be pupils at the school, were arrested. The incident on Friday took place at P.S. 30 in the Bronx. Gabriel Neiman, a 22‐year‐old teacher, was struck by rocks thrown by two sixth‐graders. Authorities reported that it was the third time in three weeks that he had been hit by rocks.

56-> Lottery Proposal Favored
CONCORD, N. H., March 10 (AP)—New Hampshire voters were giving the nation's only state-sponsored lottery an overwhelming vote of confidence tonight. With 67 of 302 precincts reporting, a local‐option question on the sweepstakes was winning by 4 to 1. The vote was 29,694 in favor to 7,229 against. The question was on the sale of tickets for the first running of the New Hampshire sweepstakes next Sept. 12. Tickets may be sold only at three race tracks and in 49 state liquor stores in those communities that approve the sales in the referendum, held with today's Presidential primary. A political‐moral debate on the lottery has continued in New Hampshire since the Republican-dominated Legislature passed the measure last April and it was signed by Gov. John W. King, a Democrat. The vote in favor of the ticket sales had been predicted, even by opponents of the sweepstakes. The state hopes to collect $4 million annually from the lottery and distribute it to schools. The prizes, as announced last week by the Sweepstakes Commission, will be $100,000 for persons holding tickets on the winning horse. $50,000 for second place and $25,000 for third.

58-> Civil (Service) Disobedience
Every principle of orderly municipal administration is violated by the announcement of the head of the New York sanitation workers' union that his men will refuse to obey orders to tow away cars if the civil rights “stall‐in” develops on the opening day of the World's Fair. The city's policies must be determined by its elected officials, operating through an established chain of authority. If the drivers of sanitation trucks can decide which city policies they will carry out and which they will veto, so can every other group of civil servants. The result would be anarchy. This is a matter that transcends the specific folly of the “stall‐in” demonstration. Mayor Wagner and Sanitation Commissioner Lucia already have lost too much time in serving notice that the city will take every feasible legal action to stop the desertion of duty the union has commanded. Putting policemen on the abandoned garbage trucks is an evasion, not an answer. Whether or not the demonstration occurs, the principle is too fundamental to leave obscure.

59-> THE RIALTO: SPIGELGASS BRINGS PLAYS
UNLESS anticipated schedules have gone awry this morning, Leonard Spigelgass should be moving on local avenues and boulevards again. Mr. Spigelgass, whose “A Majority of One” and “Dear Me, the Sky Is Falling” are remembered fun for many, is back in town, following a long illness. He is back, moveover, with what turns out to be a case full of plays. In addition to “Buried Alive,” discussed here last week (that's the one everyone is hoping the Lunts will do for the Theater Guild), he has brought “The Freethinker” and “A Remedy for Winter.” “The Freethinker” is a script of which there has been news before. Its subject matter is the old days of unionism, and its creator says he has freshened it up sufficiently now to be ready for a producer's option. “A. Remedy for Winter,” brand new and unheard of before, already has been scooped up by the producer, Frederick Brisson. It's a comedy with, as is usual for Mr. Spigelgass, a serious underpinning. He's writing about divorce, loneliness and love, raising the question of whether it is better to love or be loved. Probably, for completeness sake, it should be reported that Mr. Brisson is most keen for the play and is likely to move with it as soon as possible. It appears that Anita Loos is going to be all over town next season, uptown and down. David Black has the option on her play, “The King's Mare,” which he will do on Broadway, and Fred Weintraub, a Greenwich Village coffee house man, discloses that he intends producing off Broadway a musical called “Gogo Loves You,” for which the eternally young Miss Loos has fashioned the book and Gladys Shelley has done the lyrics. The score is by Claude Leveillee (he being brought into the project at the suggestion of the late Edith Piaf, who had been a good friend of Miss Loos). “Gogo Loves You” is an adaptation of a French comedy of manners, “L'Ecole des Cocottes,” which first was introduced in Paris in the winter of 1918 and since has had an abundant life. Go to Miss Shelley and she will tell you that “Gogo” is a sophisticated, highly‐styled French “Hellzapoppin!” Go to Miss Loos and she will assert that it is a classical French musical comedy set in the Paris of the Twenties — “a locale and a time I know very well.” Go to Mr. Weintraub, operator of The Bitter End nitery and developer of such talents as Peter, Paul and Mary, Woody Allen and Danny Meehan, and he will tell you that he's going to produce it with fresh new talent and, all going well, he's got a property that “will run for years.” There is news again that Jennifer Jones, once one of Hollywood's more magnetic stars, means to appear live on a theater's stage. The wife of David O. Seiznick, the film producer, who for years had promised to show her to us in a musical version of “Gone With the Wind,” Miss Jones now has chosen “Any Decent Woman.” The play, a dramatic comedy, tells of the problems of a woman of 40 who is full of vigor, beautiful and with time on her hands, the kids having gone off to school. It is out of the imagination of Eleanor Perry; it is to be produced and directed by Mrs. Perry's husband, Frank, who, properly enthused, reports the following plans: The play will be tested during the coming summer along a testing route of summertheaters. If all parties agree that there are prospects, there then will ensue a ten‐week fall tour of regular playhouses, and at the end, Broadway. The summer route lists the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pa.,. as the first stop, June 1, for a fortnight. The Pocono Playhouse will be visited for a week, commencing June 15 and then there will be the West‐ port (Conn.) Country Playhouse, the following week. The notion, by the way, of a musical version of “Gone With the Wind” has not gone that way, even though Mr. Selznick, apparently, is not the man with the notion any longer. Sean Kenny now is the dreamer. He is the 34year‐old ex‐architect from Ireland who has become a major designer in the theater of England's West End. Mr. Kenny is the designer of the sets for “Oliver,” also “Blitz!” a musical shown in London in which spectacle outshone all. Indeed, it's been said of Mr. Kenny that he has made the stagehand redundant with sets that move at the push of a button. Well, Mr. Kenny has the option on stage rights to “G.W.T.W.” and soon will be looking for a writer—he'll be here before the month's end on that hunt. He also thinks the composer will have to be an American. Mr. Kenny, of course, is going to be the designer. He has broken down the enormous story into what he believes will be a workable theatrical structure, and the way he sees it, it may be just about the longest musical ever put on a stage‐ it will run for three and a half hours with an intermission, have some 30 scenes.

61-> Students Flocking to Florida For Annual Easter Holiday
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., March 22 (UPI)—Thousands of college students arrived here today to begin their Easter vacation. Town officials expect at least 60,000 students to blanket the beach by Easter Sunday. The police canceled all leaves, put on double shifts and formed a 20‐man emergency quad. Beer sales have risen rapidly since the first few thousand; students reached town last Wednesday. A police official said the students were behaving relatively well. There have been about 80 arrests—mostly for minor drinking violations. In Fort Lauderdale, which once was the students’ favorite, the police would not estimate how many collegians were there but they said, “It's in the thousands.” “We’ll be putting on extra shifts before Easter,” a police spokesman said. “But right now things are slow.”

62-> PRO‐REDS IN GREECE TO AID PAPANDREOU
ATHENS, Jan. 19—The proCommunist United Democratic Left party announced today that it would support the party of former Premier George Papandreou in 24 districts in the election of Feb. 16. Mr. Papandreou, who is antiCommunist, resigned last month because he did not wish to ac‐ cept pro‐Communist support and could not muster a parliamentary majority without it. The United Democratic Left will run candidates for Parliament in 31 districts and back Mr. Papandreou's Center Union in the others. Last week Panayotis Canellopoulos, leader of the conservative Radical party, and Spyro Markezinis, leader of the Progressives, announced that they had joined to defeat the Center Union. Last November this coalition polled 43 per cent of the nation's vote against the Center Union's 42. Today Mr. Canellopoulos, speaking at an election rally in Salonika, accused Mr. Papandreou's party of collusion with the pro‐Communists and said this “endangered the nation's security.” Mr. Canellopoulos said “the Communists never give such help without repayment.”

63-> Prudential Insurance Loses Plea Over Control of Variable Annuity
A Federal court of appeals rejected yesterday the request by the Prudential Insurance Company of America that sales to the general public of variable annuity contracts be subject to only limited Federal regulation. In denying the appeal, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia upheld a ruling last January by the Securities and Exchange Commission that a seller of variable annuity contracts must establish a separate investment company and register it with the commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Premium payments on variable annuity contracts are collectively invested, primarily in common stocks, and a contractholder's ultimate retirement income varies with the results of those investments. There had been indications earlier that, whatever the court's decision, the case would be carried to the United States Supreme Court by the loser. However, in a statement yesterday, Orville E. Beal, Prudential's president, said: “We are disappointed tnat the court turned down our appeal. We are still firmly convinced that variable annuities the public interest. We shall decide what our next step will be when our counsel conclude their study of the court's opinion.” The commission's denial last year of Prudential's application for exemption from the 1940 act reflected its conclusion that the plans were more securities than insurance policies, likening them to mutual funds.

65-> COLORADO HAS YET TO ‘SELL’ ITS NEW SKI RESORT
—The new ski resort of Breckenridge is an easy to–hour drive from here. When we motored there recently, it was with mixed feelings; we were glad tobe going there ourselves,but sad that few other people were. For the 100–miletrip,the paved route via U. S.24 and State Route 9 is an enchantment.Itgoes west up Ute Pass, around the greatsnowy lump of PikesPeak, into the treeless basinof South Park and then north over Hoosier Pass to Blue River and Breckenridge. Hoosier Pass is 11,541feet above sea level, but South Park itself is so high that the straight climbover the Continental Divide seems like nothing at all. The north–side descent to Breckenriclge is aseries of hairpin curves, but not frightening becausetheterrain stays close about one all the way down. Lieut. JohnC.Fremont explored Hoosier Pass in 1844, noting at the time the charm of theBlueRiver area's patchwork of evergreens and clearings. This region is bounded on the west by the soaring10 peaks of theTenmile Range, and on the east by complicated outriders of the Divide. The Blue River rises on the slopes of 14,252–foot–high Quandary Peak. It burbles north, amidred : illows, through Breckenridge to Dillon Dam and on & its junction with the Colorado. Breckenridgewas a pioneer gold‐mining camp in1860,a railroad camp in the 1880's andbase for a gold–dredging project in the 1920's. They made somebody a lot of money, butdisfigured Blue River forever for adozen miles and more. lot of old buildings arestill’ there—the false‐fronted saloons, hotels and stores of Main Street, the chinked log cabinsand the handsome red–brick SummitCounty Courthouse. Butresort operators have changed theplacegreatlyinrecent months, and the buildingsof the old town have been repaired and painted brightly. There are now dozens of newbusiness structures and resorthomes in Breckenridge, and abalustraded ski lodge and itsannex stand at thesouth edgeof town. Next to it is a bowling alley of similar Alpine design. As wedrove up, we saw cars in triple lines parkedaround the lodge, many equipped with ski racks andbearing outof–state license plates. A shuttle bus was leaving the lodge for the ski area, and we followed it to the foot of the chairlift, amile or so up through thepines on the broad slopes ofPeak Eight. Wesaw the shop where skierscould rent equipment,as wellas the repairshop and the office of the Norwegian ski instructors.There were two big parking lots,one forstandard cars andtheother forsports cars, because, we were told, “the sports car people liketo be by themselves:” The big Bergenhof is for eating and drinking. From its huge porch, sedentary skiers can sip hottoddies andwatch the skiers on the openslopes and forest trails.The Bergenhof also has a nursery for children. We rode the main 6,100–footlong chairlift, closing our eyes now and then when the ground below got too far away. But,’ on the whole, we enjoyedthe 15–minutetrip, traveling from an altitude of 9,900 feetto 11,260 feet above timberline. Peak Eight rises another1,500 feet or so abovetheliftterminal, but an enormous avalanche area intervenes. Fromthe warming houseat the topof the chairlift,we traced the 12 miles of runs for novices,intermediates and experts,and learned that plans have been drawn to extendthe Tenmileterrain southward to the upper slopes of Peak Nine. This will be served perhaps by glass–enclosed gondola cars on the order of those used at the new Vail andCrested Butte resorts. The viewfrom Peak Eight is eastward toward Denver,60 air miles away, butthe city's skyscrapers were hidden behind thegigantic mountainscomprisingthe Front Range and the ContinentalDivide. We picked out the notches of Loveland Pass and Argentine Pass.In the early 1880's, Breckenridge was supplied fromDenver and Georgetown by wagon trains over thesetraverses, two of the highest on earth. Gazing at the splendor on all sides, itdoes not take one long tofall inlove with the Breckenridge area, partly because of its serene, well–wateredbeauty andpartly because of its remarkable location. When development of the area first began in 1960, Dillon Dam was underconstruction a few miles to the north, presaging a fine recreational resevoir as well as an important part of Denver's water supply. Too, Interstate 70 was being projected, with its Straight Creek Tunnel beneath LovelandPass. By 1966 or so, this tunnel will considerfromDenver to Breckenridge. ably shorten the driving time

67-> BAGHDAD SEEKING UNION WITH CAIRO; Iraqi President Gives Plan in New Constitution
BERUT, Lebanon, May 3 —President Abdel Salam Arif of Iraq moved his regime closer to President Gamal Abdel Nasser's Cairo Government today by announcing “forthcoming constitutional unity with the United Arab Republic.” He proclaimed a provisional Constitution that set as a main aim “Arab unity, beginning with constitutional union” with the U.A.R. Field Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer, the Egyptian First Vice President, begins a four‐day state visit to Baghdad, Iraq, tomorrow. In a speech introducing the provisional Constitution, President Arif indicated he was seeking Egyptian support against the Baathist regime in Syria and against the return of the Baath party in Iraq. The Baathist party has ideas on socialism and Arab unity that are similar to President Nasser's except that the Baathists oppose President Nasser as leader of the Arab world. The Baathists took power in Iraq and Syria early last year, but were overthrown in Iraq Nov. 18 by a right‐of‐center army faction headed by President Arif, who had been a figurehead chief of state in the Baathist regime. “We support President Nasser in the United Arab Republic,” President Arif declared in the broadcast. “We support President Nasser against the imperialists in South Arabia.” President Nasser had expressed similar sentiments in a May Day speech, saying “any attack upon President Arif is an attack upon us.” In his broadcast President Arif called the Baathists “deviationist juveniles” and predicted that the “tyranny” to which Syria was being subjected would end “very soon.” But the Damascus radio declared tonight that things were the other way around, that an unspecified number of Iraqi officers had fled to Syria. President Arif's provisional Constitution included the article affirming Kurdish national rights that had been promised in a cease‐fire with the Kurds. The article said that all Iraqi were equal in rights and obligations, irrespective of religion, language or origin, and that the “Kurdish national rights are guaranteed within the Iraqi national unity.” Because nothing has been done since the cease‐fire to define Kurdish rights, the Kurdish leaders feel the value of the provision has been undermined. The Kurds,‐ who for a thousand years have been in intermittent rebellion against all governments that have attempted to rule them, are today spread across four countries — Iraq, Iran, Turkey and the Soviet Union. A violent rebellion in Iraq was halted by the ceasefire in February, but it has deteriorated since into an armed truce instead of opening the way to peace. Kurds Raid Police Station The Damascus radio said tonight that the Kurds had staged a show of force at Khanaqin, near the border of Iran. A police station was raided and four policemen were killed. The broadcast said that the Iraqi army had asked permission to strike back but that President Arif had refused. Ridiculing the President's stand, the Darmascus station called him a “lover of Kurds.” The provisional Constitution would give the Arif regime a legal framework. It also formalizes its religious and conservative leanings, placing it well to the right of President Nasser. Although it described Iraq as a “democratic and socialist republic” whose character came "from the Arab and Islamic heritage,” this was presumably intended to differentiate Iraqi socialism from Marxist socialism. A transition period provided by the Constitution is to last “not longer than three years,” after which an election for a national assembly is to be held. During the transition, legislative powers are in the hands of the National Revolutionary Command. President Arif is.the head of the command.

69-> NEWS OF THE RIALTO: THEATER GUILD PLANS
OVER at the Theater Guild there's a nice glow of optimism these days. One reason is Gertrude Berg. Mrs. Berg, recovered from the serious illness that forced the closing last season of “Dear Me, the Sky Is Falling,” is back on her feet and in the play. She's been in Florida enchanting everyone, as who doubted she would not, and, according to the timetable, has been booked for additional enchanting for 60 weeks across the land. Ultimately, the goal is New York to give the play a chance, as it were, to live out its full life span. Mrs. Berg was taken ill five months after the run had begun here and the Theater Guild found itself in the unhappy position of having to refund more than $200,000 in advance ticket sales. Mrs. Berg's health being maintained, she will be with us Aug. 1, 1965. Meanwhile, A rm ina Marshall and Philip Langner (the Theater Guild these days) are plunging on with plans for the season in the offing. By the time the coming crop of leaves turn yellow, the Guild expects to have two productions on the boards: William Hanley's “Conversations in the Dark,” about marriage and infidelity, and “Difference of Opinion,” a sort of whodunit about big business in England, by George Ross and Campbell Singer. The Hanley play, you will recall, was to have made its entry earlier this season but was withdrawn on the road. New casting will be undertaken by Dan Petrie, who has been retained as director, and the Ming Cho Lee set also carries over. Casting for “Difference of Opinion” will be undertaken principally from among American actors, which should please Actors Equity no end. Anthony Sharp, who directed the London edition, will repeat his assignment here. There's to be a late September opening in Wilming- PROGRESS: So, you didn't think anything ever would happen to “The King's Mare.” So, you didn't figure on the persistence of Anita Loos, forever remembered as the creator of Lorelei Lee, a blonde. Miss Loos, determined to get on with her comedy about the sex life of Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves, has been rewriting and reducing the number of characters from 20 to 12. Hence, now, there is a producer who sees it as an economically feasible enterprise. He is David Black, who will be aiming for a production early next season, perhaps in the fall. Who will take the role of Anne is not sure at present. Originally, Carol Channing had been interested, but she now has another interest—Dolly, the matchmaker. Meanwhile, Mr. Black will have his name in the program for “The Knack,” to be directed by Mike Nichols. “The Knack” is to launch the new Establishrnent Theater off Broadway in May, and wi1l be done in arrangement with Mr. B., who, incidentally, has the touring rights. MEMOS: The National Repertory Theater, invading the town for the first time in April, will not be able to offer “Ring Round the Moon,” as originally planned. Although it has the road rights to the Anouilh play, it has been unable to extend these into New York because of the possibility of a musical being based on the work. It will concentrate, therefore, on “The Seagull” and “The Crucible.” . . . Next month, on April 23, England's General Post Office will issue the Shakespeare Festival commemoration stamps. These will be the first British stamps to have been directly connected with an individual other than a monarch. Holding fast to its intention to commemorate in this way only current events and never historical ones, the G.P.O. says that it is not Shakespeare himself who is being honored but his anniversary festival. IMPORT: Among the Lincoln Center attractions to run concurrently with the World's Fair wi1l be the Prague Pantomime Theater, imported by Jay K. Hoffman and George F. Schutz. The company is scheduled for a fortnight in Philharmonic Hall, Aug. 3–15, offering two different programs: “Pierrot's Journey” and “Twentyfour Invention.s.” One of Czechoslovakia's major cultural exports—the company has been seen in various cities of the continent—the troupe has been working together since 1953. Under the direction of Ladislav Fialka, the Prague Pantomime Theater is said to draw its inspiration not only from its native background but also from the Chinese theater, the mime technique of Marcel Marceau and from Chaplin's gift for clowning and caricature. The sponsors have arranged appearances also at the Montreal Summer Festival and the Long Island Festival of Arts. ROUNDUP: Jean Anouilh's “Poor Bitos,” currently running in London, will be seen here in late September, produced by Harold Prince in association with Michael Codron. Donald Pleasence will star. . . . Rehearsals for A. E. Hotchner's “The White House,” starring Helen Hayes, commence March 30. It will be at Henry Miller's May 13. . . . A nationwide network of paid regional directors to stimulate the presentation of professional stage productions is being planned by the American National Theater and Academy. . . . Oliver Smith will design the sets for the musical, “Ben Franklin in Paris,” due in October. . . . Rise Stevens will star in “The King and I” and Patrice Munsel in “The Merry Widow,” to be presented by Richard Rodgers at the New York State Theater in Lincoln Center.

70-> Ball Confers With Turks
ANKARA, Turkey, Feb. 11—Compromise proposals for organizing an international security force on Cyprus and linking it with the United Nations were discussed here today by Under Secretary George W. Ball and Turkish officials. Mr. Ball, President Johnson's special representative, arrived this morning from Athens on a round of visits to Governments most directly involved in the Cyprus disorders. The increasing display of anti — American sentiment on Cyprus and in Athens has become matter of added concern to Mr. Ball. If the demonstrations continue, the advisability of including United States troops in any international force may be questioned. There have been no such antiAmerican displays in Turkey, and the Government here remains adamant that a United States military contingent be part of a force along with Turkish and Greek units.

72-> English Juror Says BribeWas Offered in Train Trial
AYLESBURY, England, March 16 (AP)—A juror contended today that an attempt had been made to bribe him in favor of 11persons on trial in last year's mail train robbery. Judge Edmund Davies suspended the trial, now in its 42d day, to allow detectives to interview the juror, Terence Addy. The eleven defendants, of 20 originally accused, face charges in the £2,267,747 ($7,354,892) robbery of a night mail train last Aug. 8. The nine others have been acquitted. Only about £300,000 ($840,000) of the loof has been recovered. The judge said Mr. Addy informed the court in a note of an attempt to bribe him yesterday and also told the police. The attempt, Mr. Addy said, was made by a stranger whose name was not disclosed.

73-> Strong Rise Shown In Copper Futures
All copper futures rose to life‐of‐contract highs again yesterday in the heaviest trading in four years. Prices at the close rose .83 to 1.05 cents a pound. Volume came to 653 contracts, of 50,000 pounds each, and was the largest since July 11, 1960, when 700 contracts changed hands on the Commodity Exchange here. More than 1,200 lots were traded on several days during the 1959 copper boom, dealers recalled. It was busy enough yesterday to cause a halt in trading around noon to permit sorting out of trades. Dealers said the rise was based on the present high demand and threats to sources of supply by labor and political unrest in Africa and Chile. In particular, dealers said the pending copper tax bills before the Chilean legislature and in‐ creased labor demands were stimulants to buying. The May and July contracts traded above 37 cents a pound and compared with the cash price of 32 cents. In fact, the lowest closing price on the copper futures board was for March delivery at 35.73 cents. Prices of silver futures continued to climb on the same exchange, rising 0.45 to 1.10 cents an ounce. Unlike previous sessions, when the biggest gains were in the distant deliveries, all contracts were bid up sharply. At the close, all contracts were above the Treasury's selling price of $1.2929 an ounce. The turnover was unusually heavy, at 108 lots of 10,000 ounces each. Platinum for future delivery joined the metals advance and rose as much as $1.50 an ounce. At one time the January, 1965, delivery traded at a record of $114 an ounce. Dealers said a large part of the run‐up was caused by short covering on the part of the trade. Volume totaled 28 lots, of 50 ounces each, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The Commodity Exchange, Inc., announced yesterday that trading in tin for future delivery would resume on April 8. Trading was discontinued in 1959 because of lack of interest. Officials of the New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange said a new contract for mild coffees, the “C” delivery, would go into effect this morning. It will replace the “M” contract and would be for Central American grades principally. A further rise in cash potato prices lent added strength to the futures end of the trade. Prices rose 2 to 24 cents a 100 pounds on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the best grain prices to higher ground. Turnover, at 3,689 carlots, was the largest since 6,132 lots, of 50,000 pounds each, changed hands on April 17, 1962. May wheat futures led most grain prices to higher ground. Soybeans were mixed at the close, in a narrow range. At the close of the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures prices rose 2⅜ to 4⅛ cents a bushel; soybeans, were down ⅝ to up ¾ cent; corn was up ¼ to down ⅛; oats were up ⅛ to ¼, and rye, was up 1⅞ to 2⅝ cents. Brokers said speculators were the big wheat buyers, operating on the belief that red wheat supplies in commercial positions were dwindling. This buying caused considerable short covering and demand by new longs. There was little commercial interest noted. Continued weakness in meal and oil brought liquidation to the soybean market. However, the new‐crop months managed to attract some buying and moved up by the close. Trading in corn and oats was routine and light. Cocoa futures sold off 0.22 to 0.31 cents a pound in active trading. Dealers said indications of an improvement in Brazil's crop, following reports of drought and other damage, caused the selling. Volume was 616 lots of 30,000 pounds each. Wool futures fell 1.1 to 1.9 cents a pound on commissionhouse sales. Most foreign wool markets were closed, along with other commodities exchanges because of the Easter Monday holiday. Dealers said the selling was based on the poor response at recent Australian, New Zealand and South African auctions. Cotton futures prices here were marked down as much as $1.45 a bale in dull trading. Dealers said the market was waiting for the Congress to act on the cotton bill and most business was routine. Among other commodities futures traded here, gains were shown for zinc, lead, rubber and hides. Cottonseed oil, world sugar and coffee declined, and domestic sugar futures were mixed.

75-> ERHARD TO PRESS PLAN FOR EUROPE; Visits Hague Tomorrow—First Chancellor to Do So
BONN, Feb. 29—Chancellor Ludwig Erhard will travel to the Netherlands Monday to further his effort to achieve “a Europe of the free and the equal.” This is the concept that the West German Chancellor has formulated as the objective of his round of talks with European leders in which he is sounding out the possibilities for agreemet on political union. Hewill be the first German Chancellor to be received on Dutch soil. Since last November he has visited Paris twice and called on the Premiers of Britain and Italy. He has scheduled trips to Belgium and Luxembourg within the next two months and to Scandinavian capitals later. So far the Chancellor's effort to breathe life into the movement toward European political union has served chiefly to lay bare the great difficulties blocking the way. His talks in the Hague are not likely to change the picture. The Dutch Government is among the most adamant critics of President de Gaulle's concept. of organizing the sx natins of the European Common Market into a confederation of national states. The Netherlands insists that Britain and other countries be made part of such a “Europe.” Dutch distaste for General de Gaulle's aspiration to assume leadership of the Continent has resulted recently in coolness in The Hague even for supranational political union if it is to be limited to the Common Market countries. In two days of talks with Premier Victor G. M. Marijnen and Foreign Minister Joseph M A. H. Luns, Chancellor Erhard wil1 argue his case that close relations between West Germany and France are vital for the eventual union of Europe. Apart from the exploratory talks on political affairs, Dr. Erhard and his hosts are scheduled to exchange views on EastWest relations, on the weakened state of the North Atlan tic Treaty and on the prospects for a successful round of tariff negotiations this year. The friendly Welcome prepared for the visit is regarded here asafinal seal on the postwar reconciliation of the two neighbors. On Tuesday Dr. Erhard will be received by Queen Juliana. One matter of strictly bilateral interest is on the agenda. Experts of the two Governments will examine the possibility of arranging for intensified teaching of Dutch and German in the higher schools of the two countries.

77-> COLLEGES REVISE ENTRANCE POLICY; UNESCO Study Finds Trend in Growing Demand
The growing demand for higher education all over the world is forcing colleges and universities to re‐examine their admission policies, an international study has found. The study, titled “Access to. Higher Education,” was writtenby Frank Bowles of the Ford Foundation staff. It was sponsored by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the International Association of Universities, and is being published today in book form by the International Documents Service of the Columbia University Press. Mr. Bowles contended that higher education had failed to keep pace with the rapidly broa dening educational base in many countries of the world, and that consequently the demand for admission to colleges had far outstripped the supply. Mr. Bowles, who is a former president of the College Entrance Examination Board, found that the general trend indicated that pre‐college barriers, formerly set up to channel all but the top students away from higher education, were being eliminated. A result, the report said, has been to shift the process of selection to the colleges and universities, where more emphasis is being placed on providing a broader range of educational opportunities and on guiding students, rather than on barring them from higher education entirely. The report noted that between 1950 and 1959 world enrollments at all levels of education rose from 256,861.000 to 413,885,000, or 61 per cent. Mr. Bowles said that 74 per cent of this increase stemmed from the fact that far sinore young people were entering the educational systems and were continuing their education In the same period there was a major shift from secondary programs that select a small number of students for college preparatory work at the end of primary school—as in Britain and France—to prograins offering students greater freedom of choice during their secondary career, as in the United States and the Soviet Union. The number of countries selecting college material at the end of primary school dropped from 48 in 1950 to 27 in 1959, while the number of countries offering the broader secondary program rose from seven to 37.

79-> News of Skiing Eastern Skiers Get Annual Reprieve; Resorts Halt Plans to Close Lifts as Snow Falls
THE Eastern skiing season has received a reprieve. Many area operators in the north country were about to close their lifts for the season when the storm that came along two days ago put them back in business. Some of the best snow running of the winter will be available this weekend. Even the United States Weather Bureau forecaster is enthusiastic. Said that crystal‐ball gazer yesterday: “There will be ideal skiing weather, with mostly sunny skies and seasonable temperatures. There may be a little thawing in Southern areas, but mostly near or below freezing in mountains. At night it should be well below freezing.” In view of that report, recreational skiers got busy yesterday dusting off their runers, digging out their waxes, making hurried calls for reservations and arranging for car pools. It happens almost every March. Ski reports for some areas close to New York mentioned “spring skiing” and quite a few newcomers to the sport yesterday wondered about the expression. Oldtimers, however, knew it meant suntans, noontime siestas and lighter clothing. From now until the season closes spring skiing should be important. This skiing is done on corn‐like particles of snow that make for plenty of enjoyment. It may also mean bare spots. If the temperature rises during the morning. fast snow surfaces soften. The experienced skier will spend the hours around noon basking in thet sun. When the snow begins to harden in the afternoon, he'll return to the slopes. If the weather says near freezing through this weekend, snow enthusiasts can expect winter‐like sport.

82-> U.S. chances of TakingEven One Gold Meda1 in Winter Olympics Rated Dim; SOVIET ATHLETES EXPECTED TO WIN; Only Jean Saubert of U.S. Is Given Much of a Chance—Skating Team Is Weak
INNSBRUCK, Austria, Jan. 25 (UPI)—The ninth Olympic Winter Games will unfold amid a brilliant setting Wednesday morning with 109 athletes from the United States entered in the 34 events—but any United States hopes for a gold medal virtually begin and end with Jean Saubert, a 21‐year‐old Oregon State coed. The American team represepts the largest block of athletes competing in the games. Yet only Miss Saubert poses a distinct first‐place threat for the United States, which won three gold medals‐ at the 1960 games at Squaw Valley, Calif. Miss Saubert, from Lakeview Ore., is rated a strong contender for honors in the women's special slalom and the giant slalom. She concluded a brilliant preOlympic tour by scoring four notable victories over Europe's best skiers. The powerful Soviet teamms, whose strength in speed skating, hockey and cross‐country constitutes a virtual monopoly, are expected to gain the majority of the medals once again, as they did in 1960. Miss Saubert, who is bidding to become only the third American ever to win an Olympic gold medal in Alpine skiing, should encounter stiff opposition from Marielle Goitschell of France and the Austrian trio of Traudl Hecher, Christl Haas and Marianne Nutt‐Jahn. Miss Goitschell, one‐half of a brilliant sister team, has been dueling with the American girl for the past months in various meets throughout Europe. Miss Haas is the favorite in the women's downhill. Both previous United States gold medal winners in skiing were also women — Gretchen Fraser in 1948 and Andrea Mead Lawrence in 1952. In fact, no American male ever has won a skiing medal of any sort in the winter Olympics. Despite the fact that this year's team is probably the best ever too represent the United States, the situation will likely remain unchanged. If anyone is to crack the European domination of the men's Alpine events, it probably will be the seasoned Bud Werner of Steamboat Springs, Colo., generally considered one of the finest all‐round skiers in American history. werner, a senior at Colorado with a gambler's instincts and a daredevil attitude, was a good bet to finish in the top three at Squaw Valley, but suffered a broken leg a month before the games opened. Werner has done well in Europe and the pre‐Olympic events although not quite as well as optimists had hoped. Barring a spill, he should place highly, as should BiIly Kidd of Stowe, Vt., and Chuck Ferries of Houghton, Mich. It would require an upset, however for any of the three to take home a medal. Egon Zimmermann of Austria is the outstanding figure in the men's Alpine events. He is a strong favorite to win the g iannt slalom or downhill, or possibly both. The special slalom appears to be a contest between Pepi Stiegler of Austria and Francois Bonlieu of France. Others expected to join the Alpine honor rolls somewhere along the line are Joos Minsch of Switzerland, Wolfgang Bartels of Germany and Gerhard Nenning, another Austrian. Nothing, however, is certain in skiing. A foot out of place, a dangerous icy ledge, one slight miscalculation coming to a gate and a favorite can be buried in the snow. It has happened to the best of them, and at Squaw Valley only one really hot favorite took an Alpine title—Heide Biebl of Germany in the women's downhill. The three titles gained by the United States squad at the 1960 games were in men's and women's figure‐skating and in hockey. Repeat performances in any of these events would constute upsets of major proportions. Carol Heiss easily won the women figure‐Skating crown and David Jenkins was first in the men's division. Although both skaters retired from amateur competition,there appeared to be no letup in the United States domination of the two events until a Sabena jet plane crashed just outside Brussels on Feb. 15. 1961. killing all 72 persons aboard, including 17 members of the United States figure skating team en route to the world championships in Prague. The worst disaster in American sports history set United States skating back a few years and a poor showing was envisioned at Innsbruck.Alhough, the United States has recuperated much faster thanexpected gold medals are not in the im mediate picture. The best chance is given Scott Ethan Allen of Smo Rise, N. J., the United States men's champion despite his 14 years.The heavy favorite’ however, is Alain Calmat of France who recently won the European championship. Among the women, Sjoukje Dijkstra of the Netherlands,the five‐time European chammHeiss at Squaw Valley, is the standout. Her chief competitor figures to be Helli Sengstschmid of Austria. Inexperienced Peg‐ The United States has won four consecutive men's figureskating goidmmedals—DickBut ton in 1948 and 1952, Hayes Alan Jenkins in 1956 and David Jenkins in 1960—and the women have captured the last two Tenley Albright in 1956 an Miss Heiss in 1960. The pairs ttite is expectedi go to the German couple of Marika Kilius and Hans‐ Jurgen Baumler. who already have won world honors. The Canadian team of Guy Revell and Debbi Wilkes is given an outside chance. The United States hockey team has undergone almost a complete turnover from the 1960 team that stunned the sports world by defeating Canada and the Soviet Union for the gold medal. The 1960 American sextet entered the Olympics ass a darkhorse team, but squad boasted such standouts Jack McCarten. the goahe. and the high‐scoring Cleary brothers. McCarten since has turned professional, and the Cleary brothers are gone. Returnees include the Christian brothers of Warroad, Minn.‐Bill and Roger and a forward, Paul Johnson of West St. Paul, Minn. The standout on the team is Captain Bill Reichart, a center from Rochester. Minn. The United States doesnt appear to be in the same class as the Soviet six and neither do any of the other teams. The battle appears to be for the silver medallion, with Sweden and Canada leading the field. However, the Czechs and Americans would upset the picture. In ski jumping, three Americans—Gene Kotlarek of Duluth, Minn., John Balfanz of Minneapolis and Ansten Sanmuelstuen of Boulder, Colo., have made great strides since the last games and one of them could capture a medal. The competition should be very rugged, however. The German, Dieter Neuendorf; the Finn, Veikko Kankkonen, and a strong Norwegian team led by Toralf Engen must rate as the favorites. The Soviet Union,Norway and Sweden are likely to dominate the speed‐skating events. In fact, the Soviet team is fully capable of sweeping all four gold medals in thhe womens events. Among the men, Terry McDermott of Essexvil le. Mich., and Bill Disney of Alhambra, Calif., a runner‐up at Squaw Valley, should finish high in the 500 meters, but Eugeni Grishin of the Soviet Union still is the standout in the event. Americans are definite outsiders in the other phases of the games — bobsledding, Nordic competition and the biathlon. Bobsledding, dropped from the 1960 games because of the lack of facilities at Squaw Valley. will be dominated by Eugenio Monti of Italy, five times the world twwo‐mman‐sled champion. A countryman, Sergio Zardini ranks at the top of the four‐man‐sled class along with Franz Schelle of Germany. The corss‐country titles figure to be divided among Finland and N or way, while the biathlon — a combined skiingshooting event—is up for grabs among Finland, Norway and the Soviet Union. Spectators will be treated magnificently at the 1964 Winter Olympics—once they get to the sites. Only the ice hockey and speed‐skating events will be staged in Innsbruck. TThe Nordic events are at Seefeld, some 13 miles from Innsbruck, and the Alpine runs are at the Lizum Valley, 12 miles out. Bot are on narrow, winding raod from which private cars will be banned on most days for the last couple of miles. Buses will carry visitors the last few miles. A total of 50,000 visitors will be accommodated within a radius of 30 miles, of Innsbruck, and an additional 100,000 spectators are expected in the valley every day, most of them from neighboring West Germany, Italy and Switzerland. Game visitors will include a glittering list of nobility. The young Aga Khan even is participating in the Alpine events for Iran. A total of 1,312 athletes from 35 nations are being housed either in the Olympic Village here or in Seefeld. As a result, the whole spectacle is costing some $40 million at a connservative estimate.

87-> Baker Made $8,000 in Fees in Haitian Meat Deal
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4—With the expenditure of no more than a telephone call from his office in the Capitol, Robert G. Baker earned about $8,000 through a finder's fee by bringing a seller and buyer of Haitian meat together in 1961, testimony before the Senate Rules Committee revealed today. He and two partners are still getting a monthly stipend out of the arrangement, the testimony showed. The deal was contingent upon receiving import authorizations from the Department of Agriculture and the Department of State, but the committee was told that Mr. Baker had no hand in this part of the arrangement. The testimony was given in closed session last week by Thomas D. Webb and Francis E. Law, Washington consultants, who were partners with Mr. Baker in this transaction. A transcript of the testimony was made public today by the committee. Mr. Webb is Washington representative of Clint Murchison, the millionaire Texas industrialist. A Murchison company owned the meat processing plant in Port‐au‐Prince and sought outlets in Puerto Rico and the continental United States. The Rules Committee has been investigating possible conflicts of interest in the business activities of present and former employes of the Senate. Mr. Baker, who was the $19,600‐a‐year secretary to the Senate Democratic majority until his resignation under fire last October, has been the committee's sole target far. The testimony, taken in closed sessions last Thursday and Friday, also showed the following: ¶Representative Abraham J. Multer, Democrat of Brooklyn, was involved in setting up a private mortgage guarantee company modeled on the highly profitable Mortgage Guarantee Insurance Company of Milwaukee. The plan collapsed when the insurance commissioner for the District of Columbia refused to approve the concern's application. ¶José A. Benitez, Deputy High Commissioner for Trust Territories, was a partner of Mr. Baker in a plan to import Haitian meat into the United States and has shared in the commissions on this transaction. ¶Mr. Baker was an “invisible” stockholder under Mr. Webb's name in a motel venture at Jacksonville Beach, Fla., principally financed by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The Senate employe sold his interest, however, rather than become an individual signer on the $105,000 mortgage note. ¶Mr. Webb and Mr. Law “fronted” as owners of record of 500 shares each of M. G. I. C. stock that was owned by Mr. Baker and by Robert F. Thompson, a Dallas associate of the Murchisons. The partners said, however, that each had reported these holdings on ther personal financial statements. Senator Hugh Scott. Republican of Pennsylvania, a member of the panel, implied that Mr. Baker had threatened “to pull the rug” from under certain members of the committee. Mr. Law gave the committee a detailed account of the Haitian meat transaction. Its substance is as follows: The Haitian‐American Meat Company was established at Port‐au‐Prince in either 1959 or 1960, with the Murchison interests as principal owners. In 1961 the company sought permission to export to the United States, but permission was denied by the United States Department of Agriculture until certain changes in the plant and quality control were made. The firm of Webb & Law was commissoned to help expedite this approval by the Agriculture Department and the State Department. Meanwhile, the plant owners sought an American concern to handle their exports once the authorization was granted. “About that time,” Mr. Law told the committee. “our office got a call from Bobby Baker.” The committee counsel, L. P. McLendon, interrupted to say: “Our notes on this establish fairly well that you conferred with Dr. Murphy of the Department of Agriculture, on July 6, 1961, and either that very day or the next day you had a call from Bobby Baker. Is that about correct?” The reference was to Dr. Ed ward A. Murphy, chief staff officer for procedures and requirements in meat inspection at the Department of Agriculture. Mr. Law replied: “That is possible. He said that he had a couple of men in his office who were interested in a meat plant that he understood the Murchisons had in Haiti and they would like to talk to us about it. So I said, ‘Well, send them over and we will be glad to talk to them.’ ” Q. Did Baker come with them ? A. No, sir. Q. Who did show up ? A. Mr. Benitez and a Mr. Lopez, and as I recall, Mr. Benitez had his wife with him. The Mr. Lopez referred to by the witness has been identified as Andreas Lopez Curet, president of the Borinquen Meat Packaging Company, San Juan, P.R. Mr. Law and Mr. Webb told the committee that the arrangement finally worked out called for Mr. Lopez to handle sales for Haitian ‐ American in Puerto Rico. In return. Mr. Lopez was to pay a finder's fee of a cent a pound to be split as follows: half a cent to the firm of Law Webb. a quarter of a cent to Mr. Benitez and his wife. and a quarter of a cent to Mr. Baker. All the remittances were to be made to Mr. Baker's law firm, Baker & Tucker, and Mr. Baker was to be responsible for paying the others. He said that total remittances under the agreement from February to November, 1962, were slightiv over $17.000. In December, 1962, HaitianAmerican's arrangement with the Lopez concern was terminated, the witnesses said, and was shifted to William Kentor, a Chicago meat packer. Mr. Kentor insisted on reducing the finders commission to half a cent a pound. To compensate for this, Haitian‐American agreed to pay Mr. Baker and his associates 10 per cent of the company's annual net profits up to a maximum of $30,000. This was to be split among the partners in the same ratio as the original finder's commission. The total payment under this arrangement was not clearly stated, but the testimony indi₭ cated that Mr. Webb and Mr. Black received approximately $5,100 in 1963, and that Mr. Baker and Mr. Benitez got a like amount. Mr. Webb's testimony concerning Representative Multer was to this effect: In earlier testimony, Don B. Reynolds, Silver Spring, Md., an insurance man and a business associate of Mr. Baker, testified that he had been in on discussion s concerning Mortgage Guaranty, in which Mr. Baker owns about $450,000 worth of stock. He mentioned Mr. Webb in connection with the discussions. But Mr. Webb said in the testimony released today that t Mr. Reynolds had been in error and that the discussions had concerned the National Guaranty Mortgage Company. He said the idea for the company had come from Leonard Bersten, a lawyer and a former Senate committee employe. Mr. Bersten, Mr. Webb testified, wanted to copy the operation of the Milwaukee company. Mr. Webb testified that he Mr. Bersten, Mr. Reynolds and Representative Multer had setup National Guaranty and had tried to get a license in the District of Columbia.

88-> Baker's Secretary Is Also Silent at Senate Inquiry
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 —Nancy Carole Tyler, secretary to Robert G. Baker, followed his example today by refusing to tell the Senate Rules Committee what she knew about his social and business affairs. She based her refusal to talk on general constitutional guarantees of the citizen's right to privacy and against self‐incrimination. To each of a score of questions posed by the committee counsel, L. P. McLendon, the 24‐year‐old witness repeated in a purring Tennessee accent a short prepared statement asserting her claim to immunity. She was constantly advised by her lawyer, Myron G. Ehrlich, who sat at her side. Unlike Mr. Baker yesterday, Miss Tyler, a former beauty contest winner, and Mr. Ehrlich welcomed the presence of television cameras in thehearing room. She wore a heavy, dark make‐up well adapted to television lights, and turned smilingly this way and that at the request bf cameramen. Miss Tyler was spared the barrage of frequently loaded questions that members of the committee asked of Mr. Baker for an hour and a half yester‐day. Mr. McLendon's interro‐gation was relatively brief and was confined mainly to her duties as Mr. Baker's secretary and her occupancy of a town house owned by Mr. Baker. When he completed his questioning, other members of the painel passed up the opportunity to ask questions. The proceedings were over in about an hour. The committee is investigat‐ ing the varied private business dealings of Mr. Baker, who resigned as secretary to the Senate Democratic majority after a$300,000 damage suit was filed against him. Miss Tyler's arrival in the marble pillared Senate caucus room a few minutes before 10 o'clock this morning created a hubbub that appeared to unsettle her momentarily. The overflow crowd of spectators, many of them young women, craned and stood on chairs to get a better view of her. Mr. Ehrlich took her arm and escorted her through the crowd to the witness table. She wore a bright blue outer coat over a stylish two‐piece dress of bulky off‐white silk, with quarter‐length black kid gloves and black high‐heel shoes. Various witnesses have previously mentioned Miss Tyler's presence in Mr. Baker's office when certain conversations or events are alleged to have taken place. She has been said to have knowledge of some financial transactions and trips in which Mr. Baker took part. Before the hearing opened this morning, Mr. Ehrlich told reporters that his client would refuse to answer the committee's questions. “This investigation has no legislative purpose,” he said “and it involved an invasion of her right of privacy.” “I don't care what kind of questions they ask,” he said. “I've practiced law longer than most of those fellows sitting at the table. The powers of Congress are set forth in the Constitution. and it does not give them the right to violate a person's privacy in this kind of proceeding.” Mr. Ehrlich said that his position did not require recourse to any particular provision of the Constitution. In this, his stand differed materially from that asserted yesterday by Mr. Baker's attorney, Edward Bennett Williams, who invoked the First, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. When the session was opened by the committee chairman, Senator B. Everett Jordan, Democrat of North Carolina, Mr. Ehrlich asked that his client be allowed to read a statement before the questioning began. This set forth in detail his Constitutional arguments. In addition, Miss Tyler's statement said that she was being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that her telephone service had been suspended after committee investigators subpoenaed telephone company records. With her voice betraying an occasional faint tremor, the brown‐eyed Miss Tyler said: “Alleged information given out by this committee and others in authority to the press, radio and television reporters has resulted in some worldwide intimations and suggestions that I have indulged in improper conduct, to say the least and I have been held up to ridicule and disrepute by them on many occasions. “I deny that I am guilty of any legal or moral wrongdoing, but I am availing myself of this constitutional privilege [against self‐incrimination] in view of my reasonable apprehension of even unwarranted prosecution.” A long colloquy between Mr. Ehrlich and Mr. McLendon failed to resolve the controversy over whether Miss Tyler's rights would be violated by answering the committee's questions. As Mr. McLendon put questions to her, she responded to each with this brief prepared recitation. “I decline to answer on the ground that this investigation is unrelated to any legislative purpose and is an invalid invasion of my right of privacy; and I decline to answer on the further ground that my answer might tend to incriminate me.” Among the questions that Miss Tyler refused to answer were these: ¶Had she been employed in the office of the Senate majority secretary prior to Oct. 7, 1963? ¶Had she left this job voluntarily? ¶Had her duties included those of confidential secretary to Mr. Baker? ¶Had she also performed duties of a private nature for him? ¶Had she ever occupied a house at 308 N Street, S. W., and from whom had she rented? ¶Had she been visited by Ralph Hill, plaintiff in a damage suit against Mr. Baker, and been asked to intervene with Mr. Baker in his behalf? ¶Had Edward Levinson, previously identified with Las Vegas gambling interests, visited Mr. Baker's office? ¶Had she deposited large sums of cash in a bank for Mr. Baker? When the committee counsel ended his interrogation, the three Republican members held a brief, whispered conference and said they had no questions to ask Miss Tyler. She was then excused from the stand. Yesterday, two Republican Senators, Carl T. Curtis of Nebraska and Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, questioned Mr. Baker at length. Senator Scott told reporters he was considering asking that both witnesses be brought before the bar of the Senate for trial on contempt. In case of a conviction, he said, they could be held in the Capitol jail for the rest of this session of Congress. The only trouble, he said, was that he was unsure there was still a jail in the Capitol basement. This punitive procedure has not been used for many years, he said. The office of the Architect of the Capitol said tonight that there had never been a jail in the Capitol. The nearest approximation is the so‐called Guard Room in the old Senate Office Building, which has occasionally been used for temporary detention.

The first newcomer on the American cigarette market since the Surgeon general's Jan. 11 report declared smoking to be a health hazard was introduced yesterday by P. Lorillard & Co. The new cigarette, called York Filters, is actually a charcoal filter variation of Lorillard's nonfilter York Imperialsize cigarette. The York Filters will replace the older brand in initial marketing areas in California, Arizona and Nevada, as well as 31 counties in western New York. This marks Lorillard's entry into the rapidly growing charcoal filter market. Anticipation of and reaction to the Surgeon General's report has made charcoal‐filter brands an increasingly important factor in the industry.

93-> Bach Concert at Carnegie Hall; Other Music Events Reviewed
For the second of its threeconcert series in Carnegie Hall this season, the Philadelphia Chamber Orchestra yesterday afternoon turned to the music of Bach. Three cantatas and the B minor Suite made up the program, which was under the direction of Anshel Brusilow. The cantatas were “Gott der Herr ist Sonn' und Schild” (No. 79), “Jauchzet Gott in alien Landen” (No. 51) and “Herz und Mund und That und Leben” (No. 147). The vocal soloists were Janice Harsanyi, soprano; Louise Parker, contralto; Charles Bressler, tenor, and McHenry Boatwright, bass, with the choral parts sung by the Westminster Chorus. All this music was, of course, worth listening to, and it was reasonably well performed. But in the course of the concert one was conscious of a series of debits and credits in the results, without any overriding point of view or style to lift the preformances above the ordinary The debits included some ragged playing by the orchestra, the opaque sound of the chorus, a too‐fast opening tempo (later corrected) for some movements. Among the credits were some fine singing by the solists, the expert playing of Murray Panitz, flutist, in the suite, and of Gilbert Johnson, trumpeter, in general. Mr. Brusilow's tempos were usually on the temperate and satisfactory side; once settled into they were held steady. But individual movements seldom took wings for lack of sufficient accent, a digging into the music or a transparent flow of contrapuntal lines. Miss Harsanyi's singing of her solo cantata, “Jauchzet Gott.” provided the high point of the program. The Philadelphia soprano's bright and sizeable voice proved flexible enough for the difficult opening aria, and the recitative and second aria had considerable emotional force. Furthermore, Mr. Brusilow saw to it that the instrumental obbligatos did not clash with her singing. R. E.

94-> CIVIL RIGHTS CAMPAIGNS: THE MODERATES VS. THE EXTREMISTS
WASHINGTON, April 18—The principal leaders of the effort to pass civil rights legislation made dramatically clear here this week their awareness of the new tension in the racial struggle—the simultaneous heightening of militancy among Negroes and of racial fears among Northern whites. President Johnson, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, the bipartisan Senate captains for the legislation and the heads of major civil rights organizations all sounded the same warning to those demanding equal rights for the Negro: avoid extremist tactics; they can only injure your cause. But that was not all the voices from Washington said this week. They had a warning for the white community as well as for the Negroes. It was that legitimate Negro grievances must be met, first of all by passage of the legislation, if the campaign for equality is not to pass from responsible hands into those who hate and would destroy. What provoked this extraordinary series of similar pronouncements here within a few days is not hard to find. On the one hand there have been the demonstrations by Negroes in Northern urban areas such as Cleveland and New York. At the head of the list is the proposal for a mass “stallin” of cars when the New York World's Fair opens next Wednesday. Such manifestations have produced, on the other side, a frightened and more and more hostile white reaction. It is not ony extremist Negro demonstrations that worry Northern whites, of course; it is also the sudden realization that the racial problem is here, next door, and not in Jackson, Miss. Attorney General Kennedy has been saying for years that the racial problem would be as dangerous when it exploded in the North as it has been in the South — perhaps even worse, because relief cannot be obtained by removing legal barriers; they are already gone. Now the North's turn is plainly at hand. President Johnson and the others have been trying to meet this growing hostility among both whites and Negroes with a classical tactic. They have been trying to occupy the middle of the road. They have been urging the country to accept the proposed civil rights bill as a moderate program that will ward off the extremes. This is the one tactic that promises a way out of the filibuster that now grips the bill in the Senate. For if it works, it will tend to isolate the zealots on both sides — indeed, in a curious way, to lump them together as the forces that refuse to accept the American tradition of gradual change, achieved by reasonable compromise. It is quite clear that there are forces on both sides that are impervious to appeals for reason and moderation. The feeling among informed officials, for example, is that people who plan things like the World's Fair stall‐in are essentially anarchists. Their frustration and their bitterness are understandable, but they are unable or unwilling to focus those feelings on particular targets; they hate the whole system so much that they do not care if they destroy it. White supremacists have rejected law and reason. Gov. George C. Wallace, for example, campaigned in Wisconsin as a smooth, soft believer in states' rights. But in Alabama last year he preached defiance of law. It is the rest of the country—the large mass of people in the center—to whom this week's appeals from Washington were addressed, President Johnson spoke to the country at his news conference. Attorney General Kennedy and the civil rights leaders spoke to hundreds of editors at a session of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. One point made by each of them was that excesses by civil rights advocates can do no good. “We do not condone violence,” the President said, “or taking the law into your own hands or threatening the health or safety of our people.” The chief of the N.A.A.C.P., CORE and the Urban League addressed themselves specifically to the World's Fair stall‐in, and their words were strong. condemned the idea as “an essentially revolutionary proposal that might serve the peculiar needs and motives of some of its proponents but not the broad interests and needs of the Negro people.” The second point made was that American Negroes do have terrible grievances—“these people have too long been denied their rights,” as President Johnson put it. The fact is that Negroes have been remarkably patient considering the extent and crudity of the discrimination to which they have been subjected. This was a third thought, expressed at the editors' meeting by the Negro leaders. American Negroes have almost unanimously wanted not to overthrow our society but to join it. The danger now is that a sense of “hopelessness,” as Whitney M. Young Jr. of the Urban League told the editors, will drive the Negro to desperate acts. Attorney General Kennedy said the urgent need is to keep young Negroes from saying: “There's no future for us in this system.” The civil rights bill was mentioned by every one of this week's speakers as the first urgent step to keep alive the Negro's hope for justice in the American system. “We're not going to have good times,” said Roy Wilkins of the N.A.A.C.P. with considerable understatement, “if it is proved that there is no hope through the legislative channels.” The President put the same thought in a more affirmative way. The need, he said, is to bring the protests “from the streets and the alleys into the courts,” and the way to do that is to pass the civil rights bill. Of course no one is foolish enough to suggest that all tensions will be relieved if the bill is passed and the Federal Government is able to take new steps against racial discrimination in schools, employment, the voting booth and places of public accommodation. Race is going to remain the great American problem for years to come, as the Attorney General said. Nor are Negroes going to grow less militant. They “feel a sense of urgency,” James Farmer of CORE told the editors, and “no longer are they going to pretend they are happy.” One vital question, then, is who is going to lead the Negro. Will it be men like Messrs. Farmer, Wilkins and Young, whose responsibility and articulate intelligence obviously impressed the editors this week? Or will it be wild men? Just below the surface at the editors' meeting, unspoken but obvious to all, was an appeal by the civil rights leaders to the editors and their white community: “Gentlemen,” they seemed to be saying, “if you want us to remain in control, you must give us some victories; you must treat with our cause.” Mr. Farmer spoke the thoughts of many worried politicians here when he said: “We must speed up progress to avoid the polarization of whites against black that can only hurt our nation. Polarization would be the greatest crime of all.” In sum, then, the voices from Washington were appealing to Negroes to control their frustrations, and to whites to answer extremism not with counter‐extremism but with realistic, understanding steps to relieve the frustrations. If the message gets through, this will indeed have been a notable week in the civil rights struggle.

95-> STRIFE RENEWAL FEARED ON LAKES; Reopening of Navigation Could Spur Soycotts
OTTAWA, March 28 — The opening of the navigation season on the Great Lakes, only days away, is awaited with anxiety by Canadian Government officials. They fear a renewal of union boycotts against Canadian ships in United States ports in the unresolved strife between the Seafarers International Union and the Canadian Maritime Union. The Government is equipped to deal with any such outbreaks in Canadian ports or waters. It is powerless to act, however, against reprisals on thet United States side of the lakes by the International Longshoremens Union and the parent body of the S.I.U. in the United States. There it must rely on the National Labor Relations Board and the courts to enforce United States laws against illegal boycotts. To that extent the Canadian Government has been assured of cooperation. What the Government and shipowners would prefer, however, is word from George Meany that he would instruct members of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations not to interfere in what is regarded here as essentially a Canadian problem. Mr. Meany heads the federation. Last October, as a measure to restore peace on the lakes, Parliament voted to put five maritime unions, including the S.I.U., under a government trusteeship. The trustees have the power to prosecute anyone responsible for disrupting shipping on the lakes. But their writ however, does not extend beyond Canadian territory. Therein lies the crux of the problem. The S.I.U., an outcast from the Canadian Labor Congress, is still a member of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Its Canadian president, Hal C. Banks, who has just been removed by the trustees, is still a vice president in good standing in the international union. When the trustees were appointed, a large proportion of lake shipping was halted by a general walkout of Seafarer members. They acted ostensibly under a contract clause permitting them to go ashore to attend to legal business, but actually under a plan for a mass demonstration against the trusteeship. The first act of the trustees was to tell Mr. Banks to order his men back to work or face penalties for violation of contracts and the law. This he did. Soon afterward winter closed the lakes. There was peace while the trustees studied the affairs of the Seafarer and other unions under their control, culminating in the removal of Mr. Banks. The other unions administered by the trustees are theCanadian Maritime, the National Association of Marine Engineers of Canada, the Canadian Merchant Service Guild and the marine division of the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Transport and General Workers. Officers of those four have not been disturbed by the trustees, who say they wish to interfere as little as possible and return control of the unions to their elected officers. Justice Victor L. Dryer, 53 years old, heads the trusteeship, whose other members are Judge René Lippe and Charles Millard, an experienced labor negotiator. Justice Dryer has raised the possibility of a renewal of boycotts and trouble when the shipping season reopens. Allan MacEachen, Minister of Labor, has told Parliament he anticipates cooperation by the United States under its own laws so far as they apply in insuring the free movement of Canadian ships when the Iake season opens. Last year the N.L.R.B. ob tained junctions in the United States to force waterfront unions to handle cargoes of Canadian ships, notably of the Upper Lakes Steamship Company. Court action, however, proved to be complicated, slow and ineffectual. Upper Lakes Shipping vessels are manned by the Seafarers’ chief rival, the Canadian Maritime Union, which is affiliated with the Canadian Labor Congress. Two of its vessels were stranded in United States ports last year when unions supporting the Canadian S.I.U. refused to load them. John Geller, company counsel, has said it will send its fourteen ships, manned by, Canadian Maritime Union members, back to United States ports next summer despite dangers of another boycott.

BLOOMINGTON, Minn., May 7 (AP)—Tony Oliva, a rookie, hit two home runs, one with the bases filled, and drove in six runs to power the Minnesota Twins to a 9‐1 triumph over the Los Angeles Angels today. Oliva's first major league slam came in the sixth inning when the Twins scored five runs and wiped out a 1‐1 tie. The Cuban outfielder's second homer was with the bases empty in the eighth. The Twins added two runs that inning on Jimmie Hall's 430‐foot homer. Oliva also singled home the tying run for the Twins in the fifth. He collected four hits and raised his average to .427. He has 18 runs batted in. Jim Kaat breezed to his third victory against one loss behind the barrage. Joe Adcock's 415­foot homer to center in the sec­ond ruined his shutout bid. .

103-> CHRIS‐RAFT LINE INCLUDES A ‘FIRST’ Fiber‐Glass Cruiser Is Star of a Six‐Boat Display
The first fiber‐glass power cruiser ever built by ChrisCraft heads that company's sixboat display. Called the Commander 38, the new cruiser incorporates several unusual features in its hull design. Among these are a flared keel that extends 13 inches below the dead‐rise at the transom and a full‐length hullside foil that gets wider and fuller until it extends six inches out from the hull at the transom. The flared keel blends into the bottom, and the horizontal surface at the transom is said to assure the stable and fast ride of a planing hull. Chris‐Craft, a major builder of landing craft in World War II, used that experience in establishing the transom configuration of the Commander 38. The design is said to minimize the danger of broaching in a following sea. A price has not yet been established for the new boat, but it is expected to be in the vicinity of $30,000. The other five boats in the display also are being shown for the first time. They include another 38‐footer, the convertible sedan known as the Sea Hawk, of round‐bilge, lapstrake construction. Sleeping facilities for six are provided on the Sea Hawk. There is an all‐electric galley, including a refrigerator and a three‐burner range. Priced at $19,990 is the 36foot Challenger, which is constructed of Philippine mahogany. This boat has a 12‐foot beam, and the cockpit is semienclosed by a streamlined hardtop with extended sideshields and ventilating windshields. Also is the fleet is the Capri, a 30‐foot auxiliary sloop. The Capri, a keel centerboarder from a Sparkman and Stephens design, is built of fiber glass. The beam is 9 feet 8 inches.

105-> Chou Visits Albanian Plant And Joins in Folk Dancing
VIENNA, Jan. 1 (UPI)—Premier Chou En‐lai of Communist China took part in Albanian folk dances last night as he spent New Year's Eve with workers at a textile plant in Albania. Albanian broadcasts said Mr. Chou and Enver Hoxha, head of the Albanian Communist party, had met hundreds of workers at the Stalin textile plant. The Chinese Premier arrived in Albania yesterday from Morocco and received a warm reception as he drove through the streets decorated with photographs of Stalin and Chinese and Albanian Communist leaders. In speeches to the textile workers, Mr. Chou and Mr. Hoxha said the Albanians and Chinese would win the battle against imperialists and “revisionists.” The latter term is used by the Chinese and Albanians to criticize the ideological views of the Soviet leadership.

106-> Sports of The Times; Another Surprise
MIAMI BEACH, Feb. 26—There is just no end to the astonishing surprises that are constantly being produced by Cassius Marcellus Clay, the new heavyweight champion of the world. This was the day when he really was entitled to shout in rhapsodic glee. This was the day when no one could have gainsaid him if he preened and strutted and bragged. But when Cassius wore his invisible crown into his first news conference this morning, he also wore a discernible cloak of humility. No longer did he rave and rant with his superlatives and outlandish claims. He spoke with such quiet modesty that those not close to the platform had to call out, "Speak louder, Cassius. We can't hear you." In the past no one had to give him that sort of urging. It had to seem that Cassius had achieved a public relations coup of enormous magnitude, a total abandonment of his phony role as a distasteful braggart, now that he had gained his objective. If he sticks to this pose, he also can win a vast amount of popularity. I still can remember him as a delightful young man of infinite charm at our first meeting four years ago in the Olympic Village in Rome. "I'm through talking," he said today. Then he cast a sad and pitying smile at the experts who had almost unanimously picked Sonny Liston to slaughter him. "I'm not mad at the experts," he said. "They made me fight better. My mouth overshadowed my ability." It sure did. Cassius was a stunning revelation in this strange and quite preposterous fight. Not only did he destroy the myth of Liston's fearsome invincibility, but he also exposed Sonny as a crude, lumbering oaf who needs a sitting‐duck target like Floyd Patterson to be effective. Come to think of it, few of the ringsiders ever saw Liston except for four fleeting minutes against a somewhat terrified foe who was made to order for him. Liston was wild and ineffective against the swift‐moving Clay. Maybe he did throw out his left shoulder in the first round, as he claimed. The injury, he says, grew in severity until he had to surrender without leaving his corner at the start of the seventh round. But he still flung punches with the left in the fifth round when Clay was blinded by some searing foreign substance that had entered his eyes. Cassius could fend off Liston only with his glove in that session while he strove to keep out of range of the floundering bear. Clay never even jabbed, much less threw a real punch. When a fight ends in the fashion this one did, with the unbeatable monster remaining in his corner, suspicions of larceny are immediately aroused. They are not helped by the fact that Liston, an ex‐convict, was sponsored by mobsters at the start of his career For the larceny theory to be valid, however, there would have to be an overwhelming reason for it. The prospects of a betting coup can be dismissed because the 8‐to‐1 odds in Liston's favor never varied more than a point. If there had been a rush of smart money on the underdog, the odds would have plummeted. This is an unfailing barometer of hanky‐panky. What would Liston have gained by tnrowing the fight? The heavyweight championship is the most valuable commodity in the world of sports and not even a man of Liston's criminal background would willingly toss it away. It also brought him an aura of respectability such as he never had known before. In a rematch he can get only a minor fraction of the loot as challenger instead of the major share that the champion automatically commands. Clay had fought so amazingly well in the six rounds the bout lasted that even if he had been knocked out later, a return bout would have had tremendous appeal at the gate—most of which would go to Liston, by the way. Perhaps the rematch will have even more appeal since the original had such an ending. On the other hand, though, Clay may be taken into the Army for a year or two. By the time the second fight is held, Liston will be an even older man than he showed himself to be last night. And he surely looked old. No suspicions of skulduggery have to seem ill‐founded mainly because they cannot be based on logic. When Patterson fought Liston, he moved straight into him as if he were a man who realized the inevitability of his destruction. But Cassius followed the instructions implicit in the chant he used to sing during training: "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee." First and foremost he wasn't afraid. He maneuvered smartly, moving away from the Liston hook and staying out of the corners as he boxed at long range. He bothered the slow ‐ thinking Sonny with his tactics. Furthermore, Liston either couldn't or didn't hammer away with his murderous body punching. The cobra stare that immobilized Patterson had no effect on Cassius and the fleet younger man displayed both skills and class he never had demonstrated in training, a highly improbable sequence of events. No fighter ever behaved that way before. The ending was just as implausible as everything else connected with this fantastic production. It's still almost impossible to believe, but Cassius Marcellus Clay is the heavyweight champion of the world.

107-> Historic Main Street Building Restored for Tappan's Library
TAPPAN N. Y., Jan. 4—The Tappan Library will hold a reception tomorrow afternoon to present its new home in a renovated 160‐year‐old building on Main Street to the town. The two‐story frame building, on what is considered one of the streets of outstanding historical interest in the metropolitan area, has been restored as faithfully as feasible. For years it had been the L. Wilbur Moritz undertaking parlor. Robert G. Wheeler of Ossining, who has restored many noted lower Hudson Valley historical sites, supervised the project and insisted on the original colors of yellow ocher and Brewster green. Paul Malone is president of the library board and his wife, Betty, is head librarian. Nearly everyone in Tappan belongs to it. The library was started when nearby camp sites closed and 2,500 books were sold to the Tappan Civic Association for $50. Seven years ago Mr. Moritz donated the use of the upper floor of a three‐car garage behind his establishment. Today the library has 9,000 books in use and 2,000 in storage. Mr. Moritz sold the building, garage and land to the library for $25,000, what was considered a bargain price for the Main Street property. The old quarters over the garage will be used for town meetings and the second floor of the main building, which was made into an apartment, is rented. Tappan's main street was the scene of the imprisonment and trial of Maj. John André, the British Revolutionary War spy, in 1780. The renovated '76 house where André was jailed is across the street from the library. The Reformed Church, where the trial was held, was 100 yards north of the library at the head of Main Street. A new church is on the site. Near the library is the DeWindt house, where Washington stayed during the trial and where, in 1783, the general met with Sir Guy Carleton and worked out details for the British evacuation of New York City. All but four of the 15 buildings on one block are more than a hundred years old. While Tappan's population is growing, this historic street has had little change, and the library board feels it is contributing to the preservation of the area.

108-> Sports of The Times
MIAMI, Feb. 25—When Hurry To Market and Roman Brother left their stalls for the post parade at the Garden State last November, they moved into line, one after the other. The thin face of Burley Parke was creased by a thin smile at the recollection. “It almost was funny,” said Roman Brother's trainer, “because they looked as though they might have been father and son. There was Hurry To Market, a big and fine colt who stands at least 16.3 hands high, and next to him was my little fellow who barely was 15 hands high. But there's an awful lot of horse in that small package.” It's besides the point, perhaps, to mention that the strapping Hurry To Market beat the minuscule Roman Brother in the mud at Garden State. The more important item at the moment is that Roman Brother could well be the favorite in the Flamingo Stakes at the Hialeah closing next Tuesday. If he should win that, he'll rank near the top for the Kentucky Derby and the other Triple Crown events. Hope and doubt keep spinning in Parke's mind at the prospect. “Can so small a fellow take all this ?” he said, voicing his thoughts. “Has he enough substance to hold up under it? Yet I know he's tough and can take a lot. He keeps surprising me pleasantly, I might add. “To begin with, he was a late colt who was born in May. Because of that and because he was so small I didn't hurry him. I knew he could run, but I honestly didn't think he had the class. He convinced me in the latter part of last season as a 2‐yearold. “When we came down to Florida, I discussed him with my owner, Louis Wolfson. “‘Mr. Wolfson,’ I said, ‘since this is a late colt, I don't think we should rush him. I wouldn't even feel too upset if I had to keep him out of the Bahamas, the Everglades and the Flamingo.’ “He agreed, but Roman Brother didn't. He got so frisky that he began to kick the stall down. So I had to put a saddle on him to keep him from hurting himself. I let him get rid of those energies on the track. I ran him in the Bahamas and he won it way off. He won the Everglades. Now we have the Flamingo coming up.” Burley shrugged, as if he can't quite believe it. Maybe he shouldn't. A year ago he was loaded with talented 2‐year‐olds in Wolfson's Harbor View Farm. He had one rare prize in Raise A Native, a once‐in‐alifetime colt who looked good enough to sweep the boards this season. But this juvenile marvel pulled a sheath and had to be retired to stud. Ranked behind him were Irvkup and Count Bud. Both went wrong. That left Parke with an undersized fourth‐stringer in his batting order, Roman Brother. This would be the same as the Yankees losing Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris and Elston Howard so that they had to rely on someone like, well, say Clete Boyer to win the home‐run championship. It still can be done and the odds have been chopped down considerably. The one thing that helps is that Hurry To Market, the Harmon Killebrew of the opposition, also has been sidelined. The experts look dourly on the current 3‐year‐old crop as being substandard. Maybe Roman Brother won't have to hit 60 homers. He might take the title with 30 from such as Northern Dancer, Chieftain, Hill Rise, Gun Bolt, Mr. Brick and others. The Flamingo will bring about the first confrontation of Roman Brother and Northern Dancer, the Canadian‐owned grandson of Native Dancer. Certain parallels immediately intrude. Horatio Luro, the suave senor who trains him, deftly indicated them. “Like Roman Brother,” said the senor, “Northern Dancer is small. He was so small last spring—I swear to you he was not 15 hands high—that we could not rush him. Even now he is only 15.2, but he is compact and there is a lot of quality in his head. He is well proportioned and well put together with a girth that's big. He won seven of nine races and was the only 2‐year‐old last year who ran as far as a mile and an eighth. So distances won't bother him.” The dapper Horatio is bringing Willie Shoemaker from California to ride Northern Dancer—Manuel Ycaza will be on Roman Brother—in the Flamingo and perhaps the Shoe will then make up his mind whether he wants the Canadian colt as his mount in the Derby. But he won't hurry any formal pronouncement. A few years ago the Shoe promised to ride Tomy Lee at Churchill Downs and then reached the conclusion that Sword Dancer was a better colt. But he couldn't get a release from his commitment on Tomy Lee. Reluctantly he rode a horse he considered inferior—subsequent events vindicated his judgment—and he won the Derby on Tomy Lee by an eyelash over Sword Dancer. The Flamingo is a big race, but the winner could be a little horse.

112-> METS ARE STOPPED AGAIN BY WETHER; 2‐Game Series With Phils Put Off—Cubs Here Today
George M. Weiss did not wait long yesterday. The president of the New York Mets took a look at the overcast sky and the thermometer a few minutes after 9 in the morning and promptly postponed the contest against the Philadelphia Phillies scheduled for Shea Stadium. The official reason? Wet grounds and cold weather. The Mets will try again today. The Chicago Cubs are the opponents, here for a two‐game series and opening with their best pitcher, Dick Ellsworth. This tall left‐hander from Wyoming won 22 games last year, taking four of five decisions from the Mets. The Mets' pitcher will be Tracy Stallard, who was scheduled to work against the Phillies in the postponed games of Monday and yesterday. Despite the rain, Shea Stadium is proving to be an adequate blotter. A Met spokesman said the intention was to play the Cubs today for sure, barring new and unfriendly weather developments. The club was reported to be paying no attention to activities concurrent with the opening the neighboring World's Fair today. The facility of Met parking and the amount of Met attendance will be of considerable interest as the two‐year marriage of the fair and the Mets begins. It will also be interesting to see what kind of resistance the “new, improved” Mets can offer the Cubs and Ellsworth. The Chicago team was in ascendancy last year, finishing with an 82‐80 won‐lost record, good for seventh place, against a 59‐103 record and ninth place in 1962. The Cubs will present two rookies in their batting order. Jim Stewart, a switch‐hitter, is at second base, replacing Ken Hubbs, who was killed in an airplane crash. The center fielder is Billy Cowan, the Pacific Coast League's most valuable player last year. Both Cowan and Stewart played for Salt Lake City. Against Ellsworth, the Mets are expected to field their right‐handed infield, which operated so successfully against the Pirate left‐hander, Bob Veale, in the team's first 1964 victory on Sunday. Dick Smith will be at first base, Ron Hunt at second, Al Moran will play shortstop and Rod Kanehl, who performed well on Sunday, at third The postponed games against the Phillies have not been rescheduled. Rescheduling of games at Shea Stadium is no cinch. The Phils are down for two more visits here, the first a four‐game three‐day series in June and the other for two nights and a Sunday in August.

113-> CITY TAX REVENUE ROSE IN 9 MONTHS
City revenues in the first three‐quarters of the cur­rent fiscal year totaled $2,002,­524,674, compared with $1,901,­826,384 in the same period last year. The figures, showing collec­tions through March 31, were disclosed by Mrs. Hilda G. Schwartz, Director of Finance. They showed that retail sales taxes totaled $307,405,764, com­pared with $242,081,459 in the same period a year ago. The fiscal year ends June 30. While there was no official interpretation of the figures, city fiscal aides privately ex­pressed satisfaction that the three‐quarter‐year revenues in­dicated a healthy state of the city's economy. The full‐year revenues, according to esti­mates, will support the present budget of $3,091,499,405. The nine‐month figures be­came available on the opening day of the World's Fair, on which Mayor Wagner is count­ing to bring new business to the city to yield $28.5 million more in tax revenues in 1964­65. The 1964‐65 budget now stands at $3,351,453,789. On June 1, 1963, the sales tax rose from 3 to 4 per cent. The three‐quarter‐year current yield, therefore, was produced by the 4 per cent levy, while the corre­sponding 1962‐63 yield was from the 3 per cent tax. Mr. Wagner, in his budget message on April 15, estimated the 1963‐64 sales‐tax yield at $432 million, or $24 million less than the estimate made a year ago. Collections in the final quarter of the current year, which will reflect the sea­sonal spurt in business prior to Easter‐March 29 this year ‐could push the sales‐tax rev­enues higher than the Mayor estimated on April 15. Despite the failure of the sales tax to reach advance esti­mates in the current pe­riod, Mayor Wagner has com­puted $488.6 million as the yield from this source in 1964‐65. World's Fair business is a fac­to. in estimating that total. The figures announced yes­terday showed that the yield from the new occupancy tax was $44,841,452. To meet the estimates, that levy must pro­duce $66 million by June 30 and $68 million in fiscal 1964‐65. The tax is imposed on commer­cial tenants at he rate of 2½ per cent of annual rentals be­.low $2,500, and at 5 per cent on rentals of $2,500 and more Real estate taxes, according to the new figures, have totaled $638,907,487, compared with $601,034,276 in the 1962‐63 three‐quarter‐year period. Some of the new and in­creased revenues this year had to offset decreases from the preceding year. For instance, in 1962‐63 there was an advance collection of business and fi­nancial taxes that resulted in a “one‐shot” benefit from these taxes. Consequently, the compara­tive yields from those imposts are as follows: general business tax, $118,065,736 in the 1963‐64 period and $148,096,513 for 1962­1963, and financial tax, $11,429, 561 for 1963‐64 and $18,021,415 for 1962‐63. The Mayor has esti­mated substantial increasesover current yields in both categories for 1964‐65. The yield from the cigarette tax was $26,621,503 to March 31 this year, compared with $15,­072,391 in the nine‐month period a year ago. A year ago the city raised the tax from 2 to 4 cents on each pack of 20 cig­arettes. Mayor Wagner has estimated it would produce $42 million by June 30, against an original estimate of $48 mil­lion. But he has predicted $44 million from the tax in 1964‐65. Up to March 31 the city's amusement tax yielded $5,­235,839 compared with $5,­144,042 a year ago. The tax on occupancy of hotel rooms rose from $6,103,337 to $6,441,895. Mayor Wagner is looking for World's Fair business to push the revenue from $9 million by June 30 and to $11.6 million in 1964‐65. Parking meters produced a rise from $4,955,647 to March 31 a year ago to $6,031,244 in the present three ‐ quarter ‐ year period. .

115-> Many Republicans Fear Losses In State If Goldwater Is Nominee
Many prominent Republicans in the state are predicting that the party will lose control of the Legislature and a seat in the United States Senate if Senator Barry Goldwater heads the Republican national ticket this fall. The impact of the Arizona conservative on state and local races has become the principal' topic of conversation among party leaders in the state. Some of the alarm over Mr. Goldwater's candidacy has been generated by the Rockefellerfor‐President forces. But it appears in large measure to be a spontaneous reaction that Mr Goldwater would hurt rather than help Republicans seeking re‐election to state or local office in New York. “Goldwater would run so badly in this state that he would drag many Assembly and Senate candidates down with him,” said a ranking member of the Republican state comnmlttee yesterday. 'Minorities' Feelings Assayed “Johnson would swamp the state if Goldwater lualed the Republican ticket,” said a top leader of the Republican‐controlled Assembly. These leaders, who shied away from being quoted directly, based their predictions on the conviction that Senator Goldwater was disliked so much in the big cities of the state – particularly among minority group voters — that he would run far behind President Johnson and the rest of the Democratic ticket. In doing so. they predict, lhe would cause Republican candidates runninl with him to lose closely contested elections Enough of these seats are at stake, Republican leaders admit to give the Democrats control of the Legislature for the first time in nearly three decades. The Republicans have ruled the Assembly continuously since 1935 and the Senate since 1938. They have also controlled the Governor's office for 20 of the last 24 years. Assembly and Senate seats are bread‐and‐butter politics to Republicans, and retaining control of the Legislature is at least as important to most of them — and more importunt to some of them‐‐than winning the Presidency. They mean power and patronage in their local communities. Johnson's Appeal Considered A significant number of G.O.P. county leaders have already written off hope that any of the Republicans now in the field for the Presidential nomination, including Governor Rockefeller, could defeat President Johnson in the Nov. 3 election. “Johnson's got conservatives thinking he's a conservative and liberals thinking he's a liberal,” said one perplexed county leader. “How the hell do von beat that?” Even in the sprawling Negro districts of New York City, G.O.P. analysts point out, Mr. Johnson's prestige is running high, despite his Southern background and accent. “Up in Harlem they're saying they may not ever get a Negro in the White House, but at least they've got a guy in their now who talks like they do,” said a disheartened Republican district leader. Discussions with more than 30 liberal, moderate and conservative members of the Legislature and county leaders over the last week drew the almost unanimous opinion that Mr. Goldwater's candidacy would hamper the election chances of local candidates in most parts of the state. Too Many People—' “Too many people,” said a Nassau leader, “feel that Senator Goldwater is anti‐civil rights, anti‐labor and just about anti‐everything. In this, the most liberal state in the nation, our local candidates just won't be able to support him and he won't be able to support them.” The top command of the Republican‐controlled Assembly and Senate estimate that from 112 to 20 Republican seats are in danger in the two houses. A shift of 11 seats in the Assembly and five in the Senate would give the Democrats control. Republican leaders are also apprehensive over the possible loss of the Senate seat now held by Kenneth B. Keating of Rochester. They fear that if Senator Goldwater should go down to a smashing defeat in the state, Senator Keating would go down with him.

116-> Liberals Ask Legislature to Transcend Politics; Submit a Program of Fiscal and Economic Measures as Urgently Needed
The Liberal party urged the Legislature yesterday to “transcend the political exigencies of this Presidential year and devote itself unstintingly to a productive session that meets the needs of the state.” The party submitted to the lawmakers a 41‐page program of proposed legislation in 28 areas such as fiscal policies, rent control, transit, ethics and constitutional changes. The Liberals said that action on economic problems headed the list of needs. They proposed the creation ofa State Economic Commissionto “embark on an ambitiouspublic works program to helpcounter stark imbalances in our economy and society and provide needed public services inhousing, schools, hospitals and transportation.” Noting 19 distressed economicareas in the state, the Liberalparty warned that “unless NewYork mobilizes all its material and human resources in a great joint effort, we must forgo our claim to national leadership as the Empire State.” The proposed economic commission, the party said, shouldbe a full‐time executive agency.Its members would include representatives of industry, labor, agriculture, consumers, welfare and educational groups and experts in technology, engineering and physical sciences. The Liberals recommended that such a commission, financed by a state bond issue, undertake a broad analysis of both public and private aspects of the state's economic structure. Among its many responsibilities would be coordination of the tax and fiscal policies of all state agencies and development of plans to expand the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The party also advocated broadening of the powers of cities in taxation and finance.This would include taxes oncigarettes, utilities and pari‐mutuel betting to New YorkCity. “In any event,” the statement said, “it would mean that new taxes such as a special graduated city income tax based on ability to pay (and imposed on nonresidents employed in New York City) could be im posed by the city to be collectedon a special supplement to the present state income tax, in lieu of such bad taxes as a regressive sales tax that falls hardest on consumers least able to pay.” The Liberal party's programalso includes the following: Two sessions of the Legislature each year, one beginning in January and another no later than May 15. Establishment of a statewide minimum wage of $1.50 an hour and overtime pay after 40 hours work a week of one and a half times the hourly rate. Removal of the $500 ceiling on per capita state aid to localities for the education of children. Adoption of single contracts for school construction to achieve greater economy and Repeal of the Condon‐Wadlin Law, which bars civil service employes from striking. Revision of the rapid transit laws to insure retention of the 15‐cent fare in New York City. Financing of long‐term capital projects by state‐issued bonds and payment of current expenses, including payment of long‐term debt, out of current income.

MEXICO CITY, April 1 —Virtually everyone in and out of the Government, speaking privately, applauded all phases of the Fuel bright speech. On the Cuban issue, one official said, “Maybe they're getting a little sense up there about Latin America.” But anti‐Castro Cuban exiles here were discouraged by the Senator's speech.

118-> Liberia Applies Austerity After Slump in Iron Ore; Little Effect on Building Noted Despite Tighter Commercial Credit
MONROVIA, Liberia—Liberia is the oldest African republic, colonized nearly 145 years ago by freed Negro slaves from the United States. It has long had a fondness for the American way of doing things. The West African nation of 1.25 million people, about the size of Iceland, uses the American dollar as its currency, Its flag, with one star and 11 redand‐white stripes, resembles Old Glory. Its mailboxes are like those in the United States; the highway signs are like those in New York State, and soldiers and policemen wear uniforms that would make them look at home on Governors Island or 42d Street. It also has singing commercials and radio programs that include a number of taped broadcasts from Unted States networks. This spirit of emulation, however, has recently extended to such other American tendencies as overoptimism and deficit financing. The consequence, rooted in an iron‐ore boom that did not come off, has been the Government's need early last year to call onthe International Monetary Fund for a standby credit of $5.7 million. The main effect has been a tightening of Government expenditures — no new projects beyond current revenue, no salary increases for Government employes. The watchword now, at least in Monrovia's official circles, is “austerity.” So far this has not had noticeable effects on building activity although there is much uncertainty and tighter credit in commercial operations. Meanwhile, the United States has stepped in with some timely aid loans, chiefly for the Mount Coffee hydroelectric projects that will give the nation the basis for extensive industrialization. In the long run, austerity appears likely to establish a steadier course of development. The need for austerity stemmed from the vigorous development of Liberia's rich ironore resources. Three companies, including American, German, Swedish and Liberian interests, began taking large quantities of ore from such inland points as the Nimba Mountain, Bomi Hills and other areas. New railways and considerable port improvements were required, and roughly $400 million in equipment and capital flowed in. Anticipated annual shipments by the three companies ranged between 18 million and 20 million tons. At this stage, the ore, with iron content up to 60 per cent, was calculated to have a price of $10 a ton. The Government was to share the earnings on a 50‐50 basis. The development came at a time when the production of natural rubber, the country's economic bulwark since the nineteen‐twenties, was meeting stiffer competition from synthetics‐ On the strength of the expected ore boom, Government departments undertook extensive short‐term borrowings at high interest rates for highvelopments.elopments. But disastrous reductions in world demand and prices for iron ore slumped at ust about the time that new, Liberian production reached volume‐shipment stage. Despite the fading of the boom, however, iron‐ore shipments remain a bright spot in the Liberian economy. Even though prices are lower there is an assured market. Shipments last year were estimated at eight million tons, compared with exports of 3.7 million tons in 1962. This year ore exports are expected to continue rising and by 1965 to reach the 18‐millionton level originally expected in 1962. But there is little prospect for an appreciable improvement in prices in the next few years. Austerity, though it may have to be maintained for four more years, is not expected to cause a serious setback for the Liberian economy. Preliminary estimates for 1963 trade indicate that exports will be about $67 million, equal to 1962 volume. It is expected that imports will not be much less than the record $131.6‐million level of 1962.

119-> Liberals in Both Parties Rebut Goldwater's Views on Poverty
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16—Senator Barry Goldwater's views on the causes and treatment of poverty were attacked today by liberals in both parties. Senator Abraham Ribicoff, Democrat of Connecticut, criticized Mr. Goldwater for suggesting that those on welfare rolls should be put to work on community projects to earn their benefits. Mr. Ribicoff declared: “I cannot share the impression he leaves that if only the unemployed would have the gumption to go to work, all our welfare problems would be solved.” An official of the Democratic National Committee quipped that Mr. Goldwater was leading with his right and was “wide open to get knocked out.” One liberal Republican Senator said privately, “Some of Goldwater's statements are appalling—an embarrassment.” In a speech last night before the Economic Club of New York, Mr. Goldwater suggested an investigation into the extent to which “the attitude or the actions” of the poor had caused their poverty. He also said that as an “essential safeguard” to welfare programs, recipients who were physically able should be “put to work to earn their benefits.” In New Hampshire, Governor Rockefeller said his own views on poverty were “diametrically opposed” to those of Mr. Goldwater. The Senator, who held a series of meetings with his campaign advisers and fund‐raisers today, had no immediate comment. Mr. Goldwater, meanwhile, said today he had informed Senator Carl T. Curtis and Senator Roman Hruska, Republicans of Nebraska, that he would enter the Republican Presidential primary there on May 12. Mr. Goldwater is already committed to run in primaries in New Hampshire, Illinois, Oregon and California. Mr. Ribicoff replied to Mr. Goldwater's remarks on poverty in a speech on the Senate, floor. He said he agreed that ablebodied men ought to be put to work, adding that he was “very pleased to welcome the Senator to this cause.” Mr. Ribicoff indicated a belief, however, that the best way to employ those on relief was to expand federally supported work and training programs in states and cities. Mr. Ribicoff said there were seven million people on relief in the United States and that the “overwhelming majority of them” could not “possibly go to work.” They are, he said, too old or sick, or they are mothers or children. Mr. Curtis, responding to Mr. Ribicoff, said that a few have no desire to report Senator Goldwater accurately” had not adequately covered the Senator's speech last night. Mr. Curtis said a “total reading” of the speech “should raise the hope of every American citizen” and “every young person.” Mr. Curtis said that Mr. Goldwater's speech, which called for less Federal restraint on private enterprise, “shows a greater ray of hope than this philosophy of having the Government do it.” Mr. Goldwater's speech in New York was directed to 1,400 members and guests of the Economic Club of New York, most of them businessmen and bankers. The Senator received a warm personal welcome from the audience. One man, in asking a question from the floor, said he doubted there was a man present who did “not admire Senator Goldwater, the individual.” However, Mr. Goldwater was asked from the floor if he “really” believed that it was possible to “turn back the clock” to purer forms of free enterprise. The applause that Mr. Goldwater received generally came during the less controversial passages of his address. The Senator did not try to smooth over his remarks on poverty. At one point he said. “You may think I am rather hard‐hearted—a lot of people do.” In another development, Mr. Goldwater's campaign manager. Denison Kitchel, announced today that John Grenier, Republican state chairman of Alabama and a Birmingham lawyer, had been named Southern regional director of the Goldwater campaign.

120-> MEXICO WILL OFFER $25 MILLION ISSUE
A $25 million Government of Mexico bond issue, to be offered this morning at a yield of 6.75 per cent, appeared likely to be sold quickly yesterday. The First Boston Corporation and Kuhn, Loeb & Co., Inc., managing underwriters, are offering the 6½ per cent external sinking fund bonds, due April 1, 1979, at 97.66. The principal and interest on the bonds, which are direct and unconditional general obligations of the Government of Mexico, will be payable in United States currency. Under the proposed Interest Equalization Tax proposal of 1963, bonds issued by Mexico would be exempt from such a tax. The offering will be the second public dollar financing by Mexico in recent years. The first, consisting of $25 million of sinking fund bonds and $15 million of serial bonds, was marketed in the United States and abroad in July, 1963.

121-> MAO TATIS SEEN IN SOVIET DISPUTE; Peking Believed Preparing for 'Protracted Struggle'
HONG KONG, May 9—MaoTse‐tung has decided to apply his guerrilla strategy of “protracted struggie” to win a worldwide victory in his ideological contest with Premier Khrushchev, according to an analysis of an exchange of letters between the Soviet and Chinese Communist parties. The letters between the Central Committees of the parties were published this morning in Peking on four pages of Jenmin Jih Pao. the party organ. Analysts here said that the latest Chinese Communist letter, dated Thursday, signaled to Communist parties all over the world that Peking was determined to sustain its ideological offensive against Moscow, if necessary, until the end of the decade and beyond. The letter spurned a Soviet proposal, made March 7, for a world conference of Communist parties this fall to deal with the ideological fragmentation of the international movement. Peking asserted that it might require four or five years or even longer to prepare for such a conference. It suggested that it might be best even to avoid any such meeting under the circumstances of conflict that prevail today. Propaganda Stressed At the same time, Peking expressed its determination to press its propaganda campaign against Moscow and to encourage its adherents in all foreign parties to defy pro‐Soviet leaders. It was noted here that Peking published the correspondence o the eve of Premier Khrushchev's arrival in the United Arab Republic, his first trip to Africa, Through an advocacy of militant revolutionary movements and the exclusion of Russians as white Europeans, Peking has been striving to broaden its influence in Africa. By protesting that the Soviet Union is not an Asian country, Communist China recently was able to block the Russians from being invited to attend a conference of Asian and African leaders scheduled to open in Africa next March 10. The analysts here said the Peking letter of Thursday, which invited a drawn‐out ideological battle with Moscow revealed the style and thinking of Mr. Mao, the chairman of the Chinese Communist party. He has sought consciously in his writings to apply the principles of his classic guerrilla struggle doctrine to the formulation of Chinese communist foreign policy. The strategy of protracted struggle has been advanced in those instances where the adversary is stronger and cannot be overcome by direct assault. The opponent is then harassed by needling attacks while a broad base of strength is created for a final confrontation. Chinese Communist propaganda emphasizes that this is the strategy employed against the United States. The extension of this strategy to the conflict with the Soviet Union apparently has been substituted for a showdown at a world conference of parties, which Peking favored previously. Peking is now insisting that Soviet‐Chinese talks, which Moscow wanted this month, be postponed until about next May. In the interim, if Moscow goes ahead with its plans for a world conference, the Chinese Communists say they will boycott it and the Kremlin will have to accept the onus of having split the Communist movement. The Chinese Communists are resisting a Soviet proposal that 26 Communist parties hold a meeting after Peking‐Moscow talks to prepare for an eventual world conference. Peking asserted that it cannot accept all Soviet candidates for such a preparatory meeting since pro‐Chinese factions of the parties of Australia and Brazil have:spllt from the old proSoviet parties, It also refused to accept the pro‐Soviet leadership of the Indian Communist party, which Peking denounced as a “renegade from Communism.” In its latest letter, Peking proposed a17‐member preparatory committee composed of the parties of Albania, Bulgaria, China, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Rumania, the Soviet Union, Indonesia, North Vietnam, Japan, Italy and France. Of these the parties of Albania, North Korea, North Vietnam, Japan and Indonesia have tended to aide with Peking in the Ideological dispute. The Cuban and Rumanian parties have sometimes acted as neutrals. By appealing with a militant philosophy to the impatient left‐wing revolutionaries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, Peking steadily has gained new devotees. A British study recently stated that of 90 Communist parties, their positions in the dispute were: pro‐Soviet parties without an organized Chinese challenge46; pro‐Soviet parties faced with organized rival pro‐Chinese parties and groups, 21; neutral Communist parties 3; pro‐Chinese parties without organized pro‐Soviet rival partjes, 14, and parties with unknown positions, 6. The main emphasis in Chinese Communist propaganda is on attracting new adherents within parties all over the world. When a sufficiently strong reaction is developed, the group is directed to split and form a new party such as that in Australia, which styles itself “Marxist‐Leninist.”

122-> Maniscalco Protests Plan to Cut Service on Staten Island Ferry
A harbor storm is brewing over a city plan to curtail the Staten Island ferry service and drop some of its operating personnel. Like other municipal agencies the Marine and Aviation Department has been ordered to make a 6 per cent budget cut. News leaked out from the department over the last week that the reduction of $1,120,000 would be applied to the ferry service rather than to waterfront terminals The operation of piers is Commissioner Leo Brown's primary mission. The ferry service operates at a deficit at the world‐famous rate of 5 cents a ride, but it carries 27 million passengers a year and is a vital segment of the port's transport, system. The proposed reduction may cause the withdrawal of two of current regular fleet of six ferries and the dropping of about 90 men. It was discussed inconclusively yesterday at the budget hearing of the Board of Estimate and the Finance Committee of the City Council. Manlscalco Annoyed After a slightly acrimonious exchange between Mr. Brown, Borough President Albert V. Maniscalco during the hearing in City Hall only two things remained clear: Mr. Maniscalco was visibly annoyed and Mr. Brown had agreed to make the cuts as “sensibly” as possible. But the cuts are inevitable, he made clear. Another interested party was not present at the hearing, but he warned against any reduction of personnel on the boats and in the Whitehall Street and St. George terminals. He is Capt. Joseph O'Hara, president of Local 333, United Marine Division of the National Maritime Union, known as the tugboat union. Captain O'Hare was also annoyed. He said he had been told nothing officially about the reduction plan, although his union has a contract with the city affecting 600 of the ferry service's total staff of 1,000 employes. O'Hare Demands Parley “Mr. Brown is not going to lay off any of these men until he sits down and talks this over with us; and maybe not even then,” he declared. The union contract ends next month, and Captain O'Hare and his negotiating team were preparing to enter bargaining talks with the commissioner in a few days. At the hearing Borough President Maniscalco described as “unthinkable” any plan to reduce service to Staten Island at a time when the borough's population is rapidly expanding. Deputy Mayor Edward F. Cavanagh Jr., who used to be Commisioner of Marine and Aviation, offered several ideas on how to reduce the ferrybudget without affecting the service materially. How about laying up the smaller craft, or how about reducing the headway of ferry trips during the off‐peak hours? he asked. Mr. Maniscalco replied that neither suggestion was acceptable. The city department now runs six ferryboats on regular service and maintains a seventh for standby. Three new boats are on order in a Texas shipyard at a total cost of $12,000,000. The first one is to be launched later this month. It has not been officially announced, but it is understood it will be named the John F. Kennedy.

123-> METS‐PHILLIES GAME POSTPONED BY RAIN
An inevitable first for Shea Stadium — the rainout — came about yesterday when the management of the New York Mets postponed the game with the Philadelphia Phillies because of the weather. The event will be rescheduled at a later date, probably as the second part of a double‐header on Aug. 16, a Sunday. So the Phils and Mets will open and close a one‐game series in Shea Stadium today. The Cubs will be the Met's guests there tomorrow and Thursday. Yesterday's pitching nomination s carry over to today's game. Tracy Stallard, the 6foot‐5‐inch Virginian, will start for the Mets against Jim Bunning of the Phils. Bunning, new to the National League after nine seasons in the American, beat the Mets and Stallard, 4‐1, last Wednesday night in Philadelphia. The Met front office did not hesitate to call off yesterday's proceedings. The postponement was decided at 9:30 A.M. and the decision no doubt helped to maintain the Mets' average attendance this season at a healthy 36,800 for three dates in Shea Stadium.

126-> STOCKS HESITATE AFTER 9‐DAY RISE; Averages Fail to Indicate a Trend as Corrections Halt Market's Climb; VOLUME IS 5.67 MILLION; Declines Outnumber Rises, 562–515, but Observers Term Setback Mild
Mild correctional forces produced a mixed pattern in trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. After some show of strength in the early dealings, prices’ eased moderately under some profit taking and final quota ’ tions were pretty well mixed. Although some individual issues reacted to corporate news and had wide swings in either direction, the gains and losses of the bulk of the list were pretty evenly divided, with changes in fractions the rule. The rails were about the only major group to show a uniform uptrend. After nine straight sessions of advancing prices, the slight ’ correctional movement was considered a normal development Mildness Draws Attention In fact, its mildness attracted the most attention. Some reasoned that the underlying business factors were so favorable as to overrule any important correction now. The volume of trading slipped a bit when prices were easing, which also indicated that the desire to sell was not too urgent. The day's transactions amounted to 5.67 million shares, compared with 5.89 million on ’ Wednesday. . Business news continued favorable. Dividend payments by. corporations issuing public reports in the first two months of this year were reported about 9 per cent higher than those a year earlier. Personal income in February was reported at a new record and retail sales in the first full week since the tax reduction went into effect were estimated to be 4 per cent ahead of those a year earlier. Sentiment Not Followed “While the talk is all optimistic, a good many investors and traders simply are not putting their money where their mouth is,” on commenta‐ tor remarked, and emphasized that public sentiment is a long way from full agreement with the stock averages. The odd‐lot transactionsindicate that the public still may be selling stocks on balance. On Wednesday, the odd‐lot sales amounted to 452,777 shares including 2,988 on the short side. Purchases were 441,416 shares. The key market averages finished slightly lower after touching new peaks. The Dow‐Jones industrial average closed at’ 819.36, a net decline of 0.89, after establishing a new peak at 824.90 in the early trading. The 65 stocks in the Dow‐Jones combined closed unchanged at 284.59. Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks finished 0.08 lower at 79.30 after touching a new peak of 79.50. The New York Times combined average touched a historic high of 479.19 and closed at 475.23, a net decline of 0.10. The industrial component also made a new intra‐day peak at 824.33 and finished at 817.43, a net drop of 0.37. The rail section touched a new 1964 high of 134.06 and closed at 133.04, a net gain of 0.18. The number of issues declining exceeded those advancing by a small margin. Of the 1,345 issues traded, 515 advanced, 562 declined and 268 were unchanged. There were 83 new 1963–64 highs and 13 stocks sold’ at new lows for that period. Of the fifteen most active issues, eight declined and seven advanced. Xerox headed the active list, with 131,300 shares traded. The stock closed at 89¼ up 2¼. The strength in the rails reflected in part the view that the strike crisis may be over for the time being. Management has indicated that it is ready to study labor's new idea of discussing the problem of individual roads rather than the’ entire industry. B. & O. Advances Baltimore & Ohio finished 1⅛ higher at 39¼. This reflected the Chesapeake & Ohio's purchase of an additional 23 per cent of B. & O. stock, raising its interest to more than 90 per cent. The deal leaves B. & O. with less than 300,000 shares outstanding in the hands of the public. C. & O. advanced ½, to 70¼. Norfolk & Western gained a point, to 124¾. Changes in the other rails issues were limited mostly to fractions. Pennsylvania gained a small fraction to 33⅛. After the close of the market, the president of the Pennsylvania stated that the road probably would be in the black for the first quarter for the first time since 1957. Gillette Safety Razor was among the issues showing rather large losses. It was the fourth most active issue and closed 2¾ lower at 32⅝ on transactions of 99.300 shares. This followed a statement at the annual meeting that earnings in the first quarter would drop by about 14 cents a share from a record level of 41 cents a share in the 1963 quarter. Motor Group Weak The motors shares were mostly lower despite reports that production this week would be above that of last week, and some 6 per cent over the level a year earlier. General Motors, which was in the most active list, eased ¼ to 82⅞ on transactions of 47.000 shares. Chrysler, also in the active list, yielded ⅝, to 46¾ on sales of 89,400 shares. Early in the day, it was announced that Checker Motors had filed a $45 million antitrust suit against Chrysler for allegedly hindering the sale of Checker taxicabs and cars in New York and other cities. The steel group was only moderately changed either way. United States Steel, the most active of the group, finished ¼ lower at 58¾. During the day, it was announced that United States Steel and Na’ tional Distillers had formed a company to produce titanium in primary and fabricated forms. National Distillers gained a point to 28½ in heavy trading. Crown Zellerbach responded to news of its development of a new drug that would bring relief to sufferers of bursitis and arthritis. It rose 1⅜, to 55⅜. After the close of the market, the company issued a statement to the effect that it would’ be premature to project this highly experimental program into assumptions about the company's future sales and earnings.

128-> Letters to The Times; Policies of Saudi Arabia; Statements Made in Advertising Protested by Jewish Leaders
To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES: The two ‐ page advertisement placed by the Government of Saudi Arabia in The Times of Jan. 10, and the extensive supplement of Jan. 12 entitled “Saudi Arabia: An Ancient Land With a Promising Future” contained passages which are models of mendacious propaganda. There is a vast discrepancy between the totally misleading claims of this propaganda and the harsh reality of a state which has devoted itself to hostility, hatred and discrimination at a time when the world desperately needs the healing of peace, understanding and amity as symbolized by the United Nations and warmly supported by the United States. As leaders of national American Jewish organizations we were surprised to note in both the advertisement and the supplement that Saudi Arabia holds itself out as a believer in “tolerance, progress and democracy” and asserts that “we do not interfere in the affairs of others nor impose on them our doctrine. In our foreign policy we seek the friendship of all and are guided by the principles of the United Nations Charter and the League of Arab States.” The truth is, of course, that Saudi Arabia is not a democracy. It is a dictatorship in the form of an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia is the very antithesis of a progressive state; it is one of the world's most primitive societies, in which the institution of slavery was maintained into this very generation. As for the claim of “tolerance” and seeking “the friendship of all without interference,” the whole world knows that Saudi Arabia, along with its Arab allies, has committed itself publicly to the destruction of the State of Israel; that Saudi Arabia has refused for sixteen years to recognize the very existence of the State of Israel and maintains a stance of hostility in clear violation of the letter and the spirit of the United Nations. Israel has consistently pleaded for the settlement of disputes and the establishment of peace with its Arab neighbors. Saudi Arabia has competed with its fellow Arab nations in the contest to see which nation can be most intransigent and venomous in rejecting every possibility of peace in the Middle East. And “noninterference,” indeed! American soldiers of the Jewish faith were not permitted to serve at the American air base in Dharan because of the campaign of boycott which the Arab powers have sought to impose upon the United States and other countries. The Arab League continues its blatant intervention in the affairs of other countries, maintaining a blacklist of firms doing business in Israel, seeking to blackmail firms which include Jews (such as Lord Mancroft in England) in their management, abusing the hospitality of the United States and other lands by distributing anti‐Israel and anti‐Jewish propaganda. None of the signatories of this letter—or any other American Jew —is permitted by Saudi Arabia to visit its “tolerant” shores. The ruler of Saudi Arabia in Cairo, at an emergency Arab summit conference, seeking to prevent Israel from its plan to use the waters of the Jordan to irrigate the Negev. Opposition to Israel is the single rallying point of these Arab nations, and negativism is the basic theme, the bright‐hued supplement notwithstanding.

129-> Avant-Garde Aids for Home Star in British Store Show
LONDON. HARRODS, the British grande dame of department stores, is playing hostess this month to an extraordinary exhibition called Technique for Living, which revels in modern and avant‐garde mechanical aids for living. This is a startling departure for the store. It is as if Brooks Brothers in New York gave prominent display to Beatle wigs. The show, an idea of Mark Boxer, editor of The Sunday Times color magazine, is sponsored by The Sunday Times. On display in the large Central Hall of Harrods, the exhibition was designed and its contents edited by Sir Hugh Casson, an architect best known for his architectural supervision of the 1951 Festival of Britain. The purpose of the display is to demonstrate the drastic changes that are happening to the home. Commenting on these changes, Sir Hugh said: “Whether we like it or not, whether we find it exhilarating or disturbing, it's happening to our houses, to our way of life, to us. Houses —to put it briefly — are no longer what they were.” The exhibition is actually a stylized house, with equipment shown in skeletal rooms. There are no distracting decorations, and the whole setting is painted flat white. It is a beautifully conceived and executed tour de force. The “house” is outlined by a frame of steel girders. Suspended from the girders are spotlights that light up individual objects. The spotlights are coordinated with a tape‐recorded commentary on the equipment, and, as a particular object comes under discussion, a spotlight picks it out. Many of the machines are activated when they are “on stage.” For example, a slide projector flashes pictures on a wall, and electrically controlled curtains slide open and shut. There are seven abstract rooms, ranging from a kitchen that comes in a package to a carport and workshop. The carport contains a Morris Mini automobile cut in half to show that the engine is placed laterally to allow more interior room for this diminutive car. More than 70 pieces of equipment are on display. Most of the products are on the market in Britain today, but some designs, such as a steam‐free bathroom mirror made of plastic, have yet to go into production. The equipment has been gathered from all over the world, but the majority is British‐made. The United States is represented with appliances from several well‐known manufacturers. Although Americans are familiar with some of the designs being shown, the scope of the display would be as eye‐opening in New York as it is in London. Visitors to the show range from tweed‐attired matrons in from the country for a day of shopping and typical bowler‐hatted businessmen to that new breed of Britons — the young people who have wholeheartedly adopted the most advanced thinking in everything from clothes to housing. All the visitors are curious and intently examine the display. Some are reserved as to acceptance, but apparently a great number of viewers would like to move right in.

133-> The Newton of the World of Living Things; CHARLES DARWIN: Evolution by Natural Selection. By Gavin de Beer. 290 pp. Illustrated. New York: Doubleday & Co. $4.95.
WITHOUT reservation or qualification, I salute the new biography of Charles Darwin by the eminent British biologist Sir Gavin de Beer. In fewer than 300 pages of wellwritten prose, Sir Gavin not only sets out a fitting personal portrait of the gentle Englishman who was the Newton of the world of living things. He tells us clearly what Darwin did \ that was so important and that has made Darwin one of the giants of human history. And he explains With care how Darwin did it. In the biography of a scientist, whatever else the author may wish to supply, what is most wanted is a proper explanation and assessment of the scientist's work. For Darwin and his work, the de Beer book does an exemplary job.Young Darwin (he was not yet 23 when the Beagle sailed from Plymouth in 1831) was the ship's naturalist, and never was there a harder working or sharper‐eyed naturalist. Wherever he went— in South Amnerica, across the Pacific, through the Indian Ocean—he puzzled out the geology, observed the fossils, studied the plants and animals, noted similarities and differences in the living forms of different places and different geological ages—and gradually came to the realization that life must change, must evolve. Darwin's name is, of course, inseparably connected with the theory of evolution. As architect of the theory, Darwin carried through two great tasks. The first was providing the factual evidence for evolution: gathering the mass of data showing that species are not immutable and that one species does indeed evolve into another. The second was the establishment of natural selection as the driving force behind evolution: species change because nature favors the survival and multi‐ plication of individuals with superior adaption to their environment. In the century since publication of “The Origin of Species,” an immense literature has grown up around Darwin and his work. Unfortunately, much of this literature (and especially some of the most recent) manages to muddy the water and belittle both Darwin and his achievement. For example, there are many volumes devoted to Darwin's predecessors and contemporaries who also advanced evolutionary ideas but who generally did nothing beyond stating them in very crude form. The collective effect of these books is to imply that Darwin really did little that was new or significant. In other recent volumes, the famous chronic illness that plagued Darwin from the time of his return from the voyage of the Beagle to the end of his life is treated as psychosomatic, with the inevitable—and unpleasant— implication that he was merely a self‐indulgent hypochondriac. ALL this is badly in need of just such a corrective as the de Beer book now supplies. The author begins with an account of biology in the years before the celebrated voyage that was to start Darwin on the road to “The Origin of Species. ” This was the round‐the‐world cruise of H.M.S. Beagle, one of a number of vessels assigned by the British Navy in the early part of the 19th century to survey the far. corners of the globe. Darwin was finally convinced of the mutability of life by 1837, the year after his return from the Beagle. Another 22 years passed, though, before the appearance of the “Origin.” The delay (which nearly cost Darwin his priority as Alfred Russel Wallace meanwhile also hit upon evolution by natural selection, though Wallace did not gather the evidence for it that Darwin did) can be attributed to two circumstances. One was the sheer volume of work Darwin had to do, not only upon the problem of evolution, but upon other biological researches he had undertaken. The other was his illness. As de Beer points out, recent research in tropical medicine makes it likely that Darwin suffered not from a psychosomatic illness, but from Chagas's disease, a singularly unpleasant chronic ailment once widespread in South America. Chagas's disease was not iden‐ tified until well after Darwin's death. However, his symptoms matched those of Chagas's disease, detail for detail; and he was repeatedly bitten by the principal insect carrier of the disease during a trip through the Andes. What is certain is that Darwin had to overcome a painful, debilitating illness as well as other obstacles to make his. contribution to biology. And what a contribution de Beer shows Darwin to have made! Today, a century later, evolution by natural selection remains our key to understanding the ceaselessly changing drama of life.

136-> COED IS INDICTED IN MARIJUANA CASE
ITHACA, N. Y., May 18 (AP) —A. coed from Ithaca College and the son of a college official were indicted by a grand jury today on charges of possession of marijuana and selling or giving it away. The two were arrested on May 13 as the result of what authorities say is a continuing investigation of drug traffic in this .community, site of Cornell University and Ithaca College. The indictment. against the coed, 20‐year‐old Mona A Silverman of the Bronx, contains three felony counts alleging violations of the state penal law and one misdemeanor count under the public health law. Gordon Light, 23, son of Ben Light, Ithaca College's secretary, was charged with one felony count • under the penal law and two misdemeanors under the health law. The felony charges against Miss Silverman accuse her of selling 20.49 grams of a narcotic drug, specifically marijuana, to a detective on May 10 for $20, of possession of the 20.49 grams with intent to sell, and of possession of more than eight grams with intent to sell. The last count refers to marijuana that allegedly was confiscated when she was arrested in her domitory room. Under the health law, Miss Silverman is charged with the misdemeanor of possession a narcotic drug when arrested. Mr. Light is accused under the penal law of giving a marijuana cigarette to a detective on May 5. Under the health law he is charged with two misdemeanor counts of possessing a narcotic on May 5 and on May 13. The indictments were handed up in State Supreme Court. No trial date was set. The two students are free in bail of $1,000 each.

137-> AUSTRIANS TAKE TOBOGGAN RACING; Feistrantl‐Siengl Triumph—U.S. Team in Crash
IGLS, Austria, Feb. 5 (UPI)—Josef Feistmantl and Manfred Stengl of Austria won the gold medal and another Austrian tea took the silver medal today in the two‐man Olympic tobogganing race. The event was marred by a crash in which two American tobogannists narowly escaped injury. The accident involved the team of Ronnie D. Walters of Garden Grove, Calif., and Jim Higgins of San Gabriel, Calif., whose toboggan was going down the treacherous 1,064‐meter chute at 45 miles an hour when it slammed into an ice wall, spun out of the track and crashed into the frozen snow Higgins, a 27‐year‐old soldier, was knocked unconscious, but neither racer suffered serious injury. Higgins said at first he thought he had injured his back. It's all right now but I won't be able to sit down for a couple of weeks. he said. Feistantl and Stengl, an 18y ear‐old high school student, took first place with a clocking of 1 minute 41.62 seconds. Their countrymen, Reinhold Senn and Helmut Thaler' finished second just 29‐hundredths of a second behind them. The Italian team of Walter Ausserdorfer and Sigisfredo ai took third in the two‐heat race down the 18‐curve course. The German team of Walter Eggert and Helmut Vollprecht placed fourth. The second United States toboggan, with Ray Fales of Royal Oak, Mich., and Nick Mastromatteo of San Mateo, Calif., finished last in the 13team field. The Polish world chapions, Lucjan Kudzia and Ruzszard Pedrak, were pre‐race favorites, but finished fifth, behind the second‐choice German team. Several experts had picked the German team of Thomas Koehler and Klaus Bonsack, the first and second place winners in the men's singles tobogganing race, to take the two‐man gold medal but they didn't compete in the second heat after a poor 0:53.13 clocking on their first ride. Tobogganing differs from bobsledding in that a bobsled has movable runners and a steering apparatus to help the drivers guide the sled. In tobogganing there is no steering apparatus and the driver must shift his body weight from one side to the other in directing the verile.

139-> STOCKS CONTINUE TO SHOW LOSSES; Market Prices Lose Ground for Third Session in Row as Volume Increases; KEY AVERAGES DECLINE; Airline and Drug Issues Dip but Steels and Autos Gain —Glamour List Active
Stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange showed losses yesterday for the third straight session. After following a mixed pattern most of the day, stocks eased in the final hour of trading, with the result that cleclines outnumbered advances and the key market averages ended with losses for the session. Profit taking was evident in many issues that had advanced sharply in recent sessions. These included the airlines, the railroads, the pharmacuticals and some of the so‐called glamour stocks. The motors, the steels and many of the capitalgoods producers were in demand and showed gains for the most part. Although the bulk of the market appeared to lack a definite trend, there was a rise in interest in the low‐price issues, many of which closed with plus signs. It was noted that in the list few days of an easing trend, the market was giving ground grudgingly and that investors were willing to buy on declines. This was considered significant in view of the sharp advance made by the market in the last two months. It indicated to some observers that the market's technical position recently had been greatly strengthened. Market observers also noted that in the last few days of slight declines, the trading pace has been much below that of the sessions when prices were advancing. The trading pace quickend a bit yesterday, but still held elow that of the early part of this month. Sales yesterday amounted to 5.21 million shares, compared with 4.94 million shares on Monday. At the opening, prices were mostly lower, with the airline issues, which were strong on Monday, subjected to rather heavy profit taking. By the end of the second hour, the decline had been halted, with the market taking on a firmer appearance. This trend continued until about 2:30 P.M. after which a mild sell‐off developed. Most price changes were held within a point, although a few special‐situation issues showed larger fluctuations. The Dow‐Jones industrial average closed at 811.43, down 2.17. Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks closed at its day's low of 78.79, a decline of 0.14: The New York Times combined average closed at 472.76, down 0.87. This included a decline for the rail section and 1.19 for the industrials. Yesterday's loss in the combined average shaved this month's gain to 13.30 points. Declines outnumbered ad vances by a fairly wide margin. Of the 1,352 issues traded —one less than on Monday —595 declined, 485 advanced and 272 were unchanged. New highs for 1964 increased to 120 from 93 on Monday. There were 66 new lows, compared with 42 in the preceding session. For the third straight day, Lehigh Valley Industries headed the list. It closed unchanged at 3⅛ on a turnover of 143,200 shares. Again there were four airlines on the most active list. Continental Airlines, the second most active issue, lost ⅜, to close at 25⅛, with transactions amounting to 106,600 shares. Pan American, which gained 4 points on Monday, finished down ⅛, at 74¾, on sales of 56,800 shares. Braniff and National also lost ⅛ each to close at 19⅞ and 47⅝, respectively. Northwest Airlines, which rose 4⅜ on Monday, fell 3⅝, to 90½, and Western, up 7¼ in the preceding session gave up 1¾, at 112¼. Steel issues responded to the increased operating rate in the industry, which last week was at its highest level since last June. Lukens, strong on Monday, gained an additional 1¾ and Allegheny Ludlum rose 1¼. Automobile shares responded to the rise in car sales in the middle segment of March. Chrysler and General Motors, both on the most active list, improved ¼, each, and Ford was up ⅜. In the pharmaceutical group, Richardson Merrell fell 1½ after a company affiliate did not contest charges of withholding information and making a false statement to the Food and Drug Administration about the company's anti‐cholesterol drug, MER‐29. Following this announcement, other leading drug stocks slumped. Upjohn fell 1⅞, Abbott 1⅜, Carter Products 1⅛, and Pfizer and Sterling Drug a point each. The capital‐goods group attracted some investor interest. Caterpillar Tractor gained a point, Mesta Machine 1⅝, American Machine and Foundry ¾ and FMC Corporation 1½. Houdaille Industries, active in the road‐building materials business, rose 1⅝. Texas Instruments, which advanced 2⅜ on Monday, fell 2¼, and Electronic Assocates gave up 1⅜ of the preceding day's rise of 2⅛. Food processors were paced by Swift & Co., which added 1¼; National Dairy and BeechNut Life Savers, up 1i each; Canada Dry, up 1¼, and Libby McNeil, up ⅞.

141-> SCIENCE NOTES: WORK ON GENES
“Genetic surgery” is an expression that has gained currency lately among some biologists as a consequence of many recent spectacular developments in research on the chemistry of heredity. It means deliberately altering an organism's inheritance by adding, subtracting or permanently changing genes. A crude kind of genetic surgery was accomplished for the first time in 1944 by a group of scientists at the Rockefeller Institute led by Dr. Oswald T. Avery. They extracted the genetic material from one kind of cell and put it into another, giving that cell new hereditary properties. This method was imprecise because the injected material consisted of a mixture of many genes of various types. It was not possible then to change a cell with respect to just one gene of a desired type. That has now been achieved. Dr. Muriel Roger, also at Rock‐ efeller Institute, has reported breaking up a bacterial cell's genetic material into individual genes and isolating specific ones that determine particular cell characteristics. A leukemia patient in whom a bone marrow transplantation was tried almost a year ago is still alive and healthy, according to scientists in Paris. His blood characteristics are now those of the person who donated the surviving marrow, according to Dr. George Mathé and his colleagues of the Gustave Roussy Institute. Attempts to transplant bone marrow in man have been made before, but never has any previous complete transplant been successful as long as this one. A name was given last week to the creature that many consider the oldest known ancestor of man. It is Homo habilis, based on the Latin word that indicates skillfulness. Fossil remnants of Homo habilis have been found during recent years, by Dr. Louis S. B. Leakey and his wife. Homo habilis is thought to have lived in East Africa 1,750,000 years ago.

143-> College Crisis Ahead
The many dimensions of the crisis immediately ahead for American higher education have been vividly portrayed in the report just issued by the Ford Foundation‐financed Educational Facilities Laboratory. Part of the looming crisis stems from shortages of plant and faculty for the expected doubling of college and university enrollment over the next decade. Another dimension of the crisis is the fantastic speed with which information and knowledge are accumulating, posing unprecedented problems for those whose task it is to collect, organize and make available—in the college library or classroom—this deluge of new facts, theories and insights. School administrators are faced by revolutionary changes and possibilities in methods of instruction, school construction and the like—changes that promise to alter radically our idea of the teaching process and of the physical organization of the university. The most dismaying feature of this report, however, is its assertion that there is still no real appreciation of what lies ahead “even by the institutions of higher education themselves, much less by the general public.” Yet this is an area in which shortsightedness could well cost the nation and its young people dearly in the next decade and beyond. The need is for imaginative and bold planning now by college administrators for the requirements of the late 1960's and early 1970's. More Federal funds will certainly have to be made available to aid the implementation of such planning. A useful precedent has already been set by the legislation enacted late last year providing over $1 billion between now and the end of 1966 to help finance the building of classrooms and related facilities. It is none too early now for responsible officials in higher education and in the Federal Government to consider what the annual need will be after 1966, and the share of that cost Congress can properly be asked to provide.

145-> As Play‐Actor and Monarch, Kaiser Bill Was a Disaster; THE KAISER By Virginia Cowles. Il­lustrated. 387 pp. New York and Evanston: Harper & Row. $6.95.
I CAN remember as a schoolboy finding at home a woman's paper that was running a serial of which the neroine was a Scottish nurse. She was shown proudly facing a man in a white cloak, spi“ked helmet and with spiked moustaches. Below was the text: “It was the Arch‐Hun himself!”. Long before Wilhelm II, the last German Emperor and King Of Prussia, died during World War II, “the Kaiser” was either forgotten or regarded with tolerant sympathy. As Sir Winston Churchill pointed out, faced with Hitler, the fumbling rulers of Britain and France would gladly have settled for the last of the Hohenzollern rulers. Wilhelm, “Kaiser Bill,” was as much a victim as a monster. He had the misfortune, as Virginia Cowles illustrates with great skill in this biography, to inherit a crown and a royal tradition totally out of place in the 20th century and to inherit nominal control of a political and military system that had been organized by a man of genius. After Bismarck was dismissed as Chancellor in 1890, Wilhelmian Germany didn't even provide men of talent, only flashy poseurs like Prince Bülow or honest but desperately inadequate bureaucrats like Bethmann‐Hollweg. And formally commanding the Bülows and the Bethmanns was a flighty dilettante, incapable of steady work, quite lacking in judgment, vacillating, melodramatic, with the temperament of a Heldentenor, but not the voice. Wilhelm was not an “Arch‐Hun” or a monster. But he was a disaster. He was a disaster for Germany, for Europe, perhaps for the whole world. Without any unfair pressing of the evidence, Miss Cowles illustrates the Kaiser's unfitness for any serious job and imputes to him some of the guilt for the catastrophe of 1914. Wilhelm was also, the victim of a system; his career exemplifies the difficulty of giving an heir apparent a suitable education in this century and the dangers of him effective political power. Of course, the Kaiser didn't exercise effective power, but his existence prevented anyone else from exercising it. It has long been customary to attribute the marked faults of the Kaiser's personality to his withered arm. Miss . Cowles argues ingeniously that the importance of this handicap has been exaggerated and that he adjusted, with courage and success, to his misfortune. If he was always putting on an act, it was because of a naturally histrionic temperament, ’ not merely to offset his crippled state. He certainly was histrionic and the admirable illustrations in this book show how often the Emperor and King was casting himself as the hero of a musical. Some of his misfortunes and the misfortunes of his country came from his theatricality. It was he who called the Germans “Huns,” and he was known in Berlin as “the indiscreet ” Many of his troubles came from his not being able to keep his mouth shut. His exhibitionism may have had a source that Miss Cowles ignores. Wilhelm genuinely believed that he had been put on the throne by “the Grace of. God” and “owned” Prussia by Divine Bight. But there was a catch which may explain, though it does not excuse, the Kaiser's antics. The kingdom of Prussia that Wilhelm II inherited consisted in great part of territories quite recently reft from other rulers “by the Grace of God.” Miss Cowles does not seem to appreciate the political significance of the young prince being sent to school in Cassel, so recently the capital of the Grand Duke of Hesse‐Cassel. The castle of Wilhelmshohe, where Wilhelm spent so much of his time, was a recent piece of property taken (or stolen) from its rulers. If the Kaiser was deeply angered by Bismarck's having as a guest a Reichstag deputy of whom the Kaiser disapproved, it was in part because the guest was Ludwig Windthorst (a point Miss Cowles does not make), who was not only the head of the Catholic Center party but a Hanoverian—and the Hohenzollerns had quite recently gobbled up the kingdom of Hanover. For a great many of the German princes, the Hohenzollerns were parvenus; the real Kaiser was in Vienna. Franz Josef didn't need to playact. Wilhelm did. In the same way, Wilhelm resented the social ease of his playboy uncle, Edward VII. British statesmen knew that Edward VII was not a serious political force, but Wilhelm, long after Edward's death, seriously thought that the dead King (like Juiius Caesar) was mighty in the grave. Fundamental frivolity was Wilhelm's fault, not an aggressive passion for warlike glory. In his old age, he came to see that the quarrel with Britain was the great Qerman mistake. but not that by his naval policy he had been the main begetter of the quarrel. Miss Cowles, who has also written biographies of Edward VII and Winston Churchill, notes the admiration that Theodore Roosevelt and Wilhelm II had for each other. Wilhelm was in fact a kind of parody of T.R. Henry Adams described T.R. as “pure act” Wilhelm II was pure caprice, a misfortune for him and for millions of other ‐men. This is not a book of profound learning,but it is lively and intelligent and makes very good reading.

148-> Heroin Found in Candy Bar; State Hospital Visitor Held
A chocolate bar left by a visitor for an inmate of the Manhattan State Hospital on Wards Island Thursday afternoon led to the arrest yesterday of a 20‐year‐old secretary. The bar contained three decks of heroin enclosed in glassine containers. The secretary, Julia G. Welch of 105 East 10th Street, had visited the hospital in an attempt to see Joel Silverman, 23, of 8 Bonnie Court, Merrick, L. I. He was arrested for illegal pos‐ session of barbiturates last Dec. 9 and is being held in the maximum security ward of the hospital. Miss Welch was told that she had come a day early—that visiting day was Friday. She then left a bag containing a shirt, socks, after‐shave lotion and the candy. Hospital security officers found the heroin in a routine search. When arrested by the police she allegedly admitted the act and was arraigned before CriminaI Court Judge Francis X. O'Brien and released for a hearing on Feb. 14.

149-> Atlanta Paper Backs Civil Rights Bill
ATLANTA. Jan. 21—One of the South's leading newspapers switched today from opposition to support of the public accommodations section of the civil rights bill. The Atlanta Constitution said in an editorial that the refusal of hotels, restaurants and similar establishments to desegregate voluntarily had destroyed the premise for its npnnsition Negoes have won a favorable community consensus here. according to the newspaper, and are within sight of a Federal law bringing the desegregation they seek. But the Constitution urged that neither of these be placed in jeopardy by nrovocative demonstrations" of the type that led to a brawl last Saturday night between the police and a Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee group. The editorial, entitled “For a Public Accommodations Law; Against This SNCC‐Led Lawlessness.” was written by Eugene Patterson, the editor. Mr. Patterson said that discrimination in public accommodations was wrong. He noted that “most good hotels and some restaurants” had ended the practice at the urging of Atlanta's governmental, business, civic and religious leaders. Those who have not, the editorial contended, are “seriously jeopardizing the name and the future of a city that others have labored, through many difficult adjustments, to build.” The Constitution said that it had opposed a public accommo‐ dations law “because we believed the Atlanta owners could be persuaded to cease discrimination voluntarily.” “It is clear now that they will not,” the newspaper said, continuing: “Faced with the alternatives either of passing a Federal law or of seeing Atlanta further degraded and stripped of its ideal of fair play, this newspaper now endorses the public accommodations section of the Civil Rights Bill and urges its prompt passage. Atlanta urgently needs it.” The editorial then asked the Negroes to help “work out in Cong ress what the united white and Negro leadership has been to work out here on its own.”

151-> PARIS ENLARGING ITS ROLE IN CONGO; Adoula Flies New Jet Route to France for Talks
LEOPOLDVILLE, the Congo, April 21 — Premier Cyrille Adoula climbed aboard a French jet this afternoon to inaugurate the new weekly air service between Leopoldville and Paris. Mr. Adoula's trip to the French capital was more than just another inaugural flight. It was a symbol of the new and rapidly growing role France is playing in the Congo. This role is expected to expand further as a result of talks Mr. Adoula will have with French leaders during his five days in Paris. However, there is already ample evidence that the Congo is a prime target of President de Gaulle's new world‐wide diplomatic offensive. The pace of French activity here is particularly impressive because, only a year and a half ago, France's relations with the Congo were seriously strained. France consistently refused to support the United Nations operations here. She made no secret of her reservations about the role of the United Nations in ending the secession cf Katanga Province. Moise Tshombe, then President of Katanga, had many French advisers and drew aid and comfort from the former French Congo, where French influence was still great. All this was deeply resented by the Adoula Government. However, since the end of Katanga's secession in January, 1963, Paris has moved quickly to improve its relations with Leopoldville. One ot France's most important steps was the appointment last fall of a new Ambassador here. He is Jacques KoscziuskoMorizet, an experienced diplomat. with wide knowledge of African affairs. He has represented France in the United Nations Trusteeship Council. French aid has not yet begun here in earnest. The technical and cultural cooperation agreement, signed last December, calls for aid to be concentrated at first in the cultural and educational fields. This is a standard French practice. French language and culture pave the way for other kinds of involvement. The Ambassador hopes to have 50 teachers here by the end of the year. However, the French plan to use these teachers somewhat differently than were teachers from Belgium, which gave the Congo her independence in 1960. The French instructors will be concentrated in the Congo's universities and top technical schools rather than spread out through primary and secondary schools. Likewise, the French will give about 350 scholarships for study in France, chiefly to advanced students who need specific types of training not available here. The Ambassador also hopes to have about 50 technicalassistance experts here by thc end of the year.

152-> Letters to The Times; To Discourage Smoking
TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES: The report of the Surgeon General on tobacco indicated that suggestions for remedial legislation would follow. Our past experience makes it exceedingly doubtful that we can successfully legislate any addiction out of existence. Our efforts in the twenties with alcohol and since 1914 with narcotics are and were both failures. We cannot expect that existing smokers will, in large numbers, change their habit. Nor can we hope, in an economy like our own, to interfere with the production, marketing or advertising of these noxious products. Therefore, we must direct our energies toward the prevention of tobacco addiction in the young. The television industry might insist that there be no smoking on “stage” and request that advertisers discontinue the endorsement of tobacco by popular idols. This may serve to make smoking less attractive to the young, who are always seeking to emulate their heroes whether they be political figures, athletes or stage personalities.

153-> Productivity Said to Cost Two Million Jobs Yearly
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20—President Johnson told Congress today that two million jobs were being wiped out every year by the increasing productivity of American workers and their equipment. The estimate of job losses because of productivity gains was the highest ever made by the Government, and was considerably larger than the figures generally used by business analysts. The President nevertheless expresed confidence, in his annual Economic Message to Congress, that economic expansion would create enough new jobs this year to take care of the displaced workers, to employ the million new workers entering the job market and to reduce unemployment to 5 per cent by the year's end. Altogether, this would require a total of three anda half million new jobs. In 1963, about three million new jobs were created, which meant there was no reduction in unemployment. Despite the finding that rising individual productivity eliminates two million jobs a year, the President's Council of Economic Advisers concluded there was no definite evidence of any exceptional increase in the recent pace of productivity gains. These advances have been measurably higher in the last three years than those of the period between 1950 and 1960, the council said, but so far there is no sure sign that they represent a new trend. The increase in output per man‐hour worked is the usual measure of productivity gains. It was 3.5 per cent last year, the council said, and also averaged 3.5 per cent per year over the last three years. This compares with an annual average rise of 2.7 per cent in the nineteen‐fifities, but is lower than the average 4.5 per cent per year recorded between 1947 and 1950. Productivity gains, the council emphasized, are not solely caused by machines replacing men, or “automation,” nor by improvements in other types of machinery or in production methods. The use of more machines, even if they are not better ones, and the development of new products that have greater value for the amount of labor put into them also contribute to increased productivity. So, also, do improvements in the quality of the labor force, such as greater education and better health, which enable workers to turn out greater value for each hour worked. In this connection, the council found that there might be little reason for the widespread fear that the rapidly modernizing production system would call for more educated workers than the nation could provide. The council said: “The current changes in skill requirements appear to continue a long evolutionary process. Professional and technical workers and craftsmen, for instance, accounted for about 15 per cent of the work force in 1900, 23 per cent in 1950 and 26 per cent in 1960. “In contrast, unskilled farm and nonfarm workers accounted for 30 per cent of the labor force in 1900, 11 per cent in 1950 and only 8 per cent in 1960.” Observing that it is not yet clear whether automation caused any acceleration in these trends, the council proposed that the question be among those studied by a commission on automation. Such a commission was first proposed by President Kennedy and has now been endorsed by President Johnson. The natural turnover in the labor force should also help the country meet its requirements for skilled workers, the council said. An average of 2.6 million young workers enter the labor force each year, and an average of 1.7 older workers and women die or leave the labor force. Thus, the council said, by 1970 fully 30 per cent of those in the labor force will be persons who were not in the job market in 1960. “This substantial inflow of new workers can provide a supply of relatively well educated and mobile labor for expanding activities,” the council said. Technological change can certainly bring problems, the council said, but it added: “Any comprehensive appraisal can lead only to the conclusion that the benefits of technological change—in the future as in the past—are such that public policy should foster rather than shun it.” To ease the transitional problems of workers who are displaced by advancing technology and other forms of increasing productivity, the economic report proposed an eight‐point program. All of the elements of the program have been proposed previously by the Kennedy or Johnson administrations, or both. Among the proposals was expansion of manpower retraining, especially for youth; improved unemployment insurance benefits; stronger Federal‐state employment service, and further work toward eliminating racial discrimination in employment.

155-> RENT STRIKE MARCH ON PQLICE PLANNED
Jesse Gray, a leader of the Harlem rent strike, announced plans yesterday to picket police headquarters next week “to raise one demand for Murphy and his Police Department: jail the slumlords.” Addressing a street meeting of about 50 persons in Spanish Harlem, Mr. Gray charged: “The Police Department is here to protect the landlord and not you, the tenant.” After his brief speech, Mr. Gray said the tentative plan was to form the picket line at 11 A.M. Friday outside police headquarters at 240 Centre Street. The meeting, at East 116th Street and Park Avenue, was called by the East Harlem Tenants Council of 155 East 123rd Street. Ted Velez, chairman of the council, claimed 1,200 local families had joined the rent strike since the council was formed last month. Other speakers at the hourlong meeting included the Rev. Milton A. Galamison, who thanked local residents for supporting his two school boycotts, and Malcolm X, who accused the police of hoping Harlem residents would break the law. “Then,” he said, “they'll be free to put clubs to the side of your head.”

156-> ‘Rehashing’ of Charges Against N.Y.R.A. Halted
ALBANY, March 4 (UPI) —The Senate majority leader, Walter J.

The Buffalo Republican said there would be no further discussion of the charges until a report had been received from the State Controller's office. An auditor was named yesterday to examine the books and records of the association. The original charges were made by Senator Seymour R. Thaler, Democrat of Queens. Today he injected the issue of discrimination when he charged that “no Negro or Puerto Rican was a member of the Jockey Club and Turf and Field Club” and “not a single Jew, Negro or Puerto Rican was a paid employe of the association.”

The climactic institution of socIal and intellectual New York‐the cocktail party‐is shown here as a fashionable salon. But under this cool and elegant surface the cocktail party is New York's informal political congress, its jousting field, its major relaxation and its primary exchange market for the buying and selling of talent and ideas ‐ always with attention to amorous exploration. Few individuals manage to put their stamp on New York, but the city puts its stamp, in one way or arnother, on each of its 8,000,000 inhabitantsincluding its artists. Every New Yorker chooses, or is forced into, a fragment that becomes, for him, New York. On these pages six artists give their reactions, either as participants or observers, and in contrasting styles, to the ways people cope with the process of living in a megalopolis where the individual survives only as one cell of an organism too complicated and too changeable for total comprehension.

When it's all over I'll come back into the world and explain what I've been doing,” Mr. Wilder's arrival in Naples was without fanfare. “I want nothing to do with newspapermen. No interviews—nothing. At least not for a year or so,” he said. Neither Italy nor the United States is the locale of his work, “nor this century for that matter,” he said, adding that the novel was about half finished. He declined to comment upon his hideaway, but it seemed likely he would move into one of the many Venetian villas in the Veneto part of the Po valley.

169-> SPEAKING OF BOOKS
IT seems odd that although specific collective nouns have long been applied to so many birds and animals when gathered in small or large companies, none has been the special property of the sea gull. No bird save the robin or the duck is more readily identified by the average person who is not a dedicated bird watcher. He is the only bird except the sparrow that many New York children have ever seen. Moreover, although he does not fly in flocks like geese or other migrants, he does like to congregate when he is not searching for food, as he is most of the time. Any Manhattanite can observe him sitting in solemn conclave on the surface of the Central Park reservoir. When I made passing reference to this discrimination in “The Magic and Mystery of Words,” George A. Hough Jr., editor of the Falmouth Enterprise, offered some interesting observations on the subject, treating it as another instance of the occasional (and perhaps increasing?) poverty of our language. Why, he asked, do we content ourselves with such a variously applied word as “flock”? “Majestic as they are in flight, imposing as they are at rest on spiles or breakwater, we have found no better collective name for them than that borrowed from the backyard of hens and roosters.” In mentioning the fact that gulls frequently assemble in great congregations, I had, he thought, incidentally suggested an appropriate and appealing collective noun for them. “In white and black surplices, gulls are dressed for the part.” Coastal New Englanders are also particularly interested in the group designations applied to whales, and Mr. Hough made this the subject of another article. I was once reproved by a correspondent for having spoken of whales as gathering in herds; the only acceptable term, I was told, is gam. Actually, whales in company have been designated by more collective nouns than any other creature. Melville in “Moby Dick” referred to pods, shoals, schools and herds of whales. As for gam, he defined it as “A social meeting of two (or more) whaleships, generally on a cruising ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits by boats' crews: the two captains remaining for the time on board of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other.” As Mr. Hough pointed out, the term came to be used in New England whaling towns in reference to an exchange of gossip between women meeting for a chat. They had had a gam. THE appropriateness of certain group terms is an interesting matter. Fish, unlike animals and birds, have been confined to one collective noun—schools, and it is not surprising that whales, mammals though they are, should have shared the term. And being mammals, it is more surprising that a word now applied only to the larger animals — herd — should have been used for whales in company. Herd connotes size; to speak of a herd of mice would be ludicrous. And yet it was not always so. If one turns to the Oxford English Dictionary—that most formidable of scholarly undertakings—one discovers that in the 15th century herd was used in connection with swans, cranes and wrens. We have become so used to thinking of a band of wolves as a pack that we are jolted when we find Dryden quoted as having written, “herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors ears.” To browse in the pages of the O.E.D. is to encounter continual surprises. He who has never consulted it has no conception of how many obsolete words there are in English, not to speak of the changes in meaning that have accompanied those words which do persist. Many of these are fantastic — the words that have come to mean the opposite of what they were first intended to denote. At random, take the word “gang,” which for some inexplicable reason, was long ago applied to a gathering of elks. Curiously, the O.E.D. attributes such a use of the term to the United States, specifying its application to the elk and the buffalo. As a matter of fact, this is one of the collective nouns included in those medieval books in which group designations were first collected. If any American writer ever referred to a gang of elk or buffalo, rather than a herd, he has escaped my notice. It is difficult to determine how some of the ancient group terms for animals and birds were arrived at, and in many instances, not even the O.E.D. sheds any light. Some. like a siege (sometimes sedge) of herons are explainable. Siege once meant the place in which a thing is set; it also meant a privy. Among other meanings, it denoted the place where a heron watched for its prey and thus, by association, it became a word to designate a group of herons. Some of the terms were poetic, like an ascension or exaltation of larks. Some, like a shrewdness of apes (shrewd once meant mischievous) referred to a characteristic—in this case, one we ascribe to monkeys. It might be amusing to devise a few new collective nouns for contemporary usage. For example. how about a blather of beats or a babel of critics?

171-> Sperry Rand Raises Earnings As Sales Advance for Quarter
A 54 per cent rise in its third fiscal quarter earnings lifted the net income of the Sperry Rand Corporation for the nine months ended Dec. 31 by 49 per cent over the cor responding period a year earlier. Harry F. Vickers, president, said yesterday that profits for the third quarter totaled $7,788,741, or 25 cents a share. In the third fiscal quarter, ended Dec. 31, 1962, the net income was 5.052,154, or 16 cents a share. Sales for the third quarter rose to $328,090,041 from $315,355,158 a year earlier. Net income for the nine months increased to $17,846.675, or 57 cents a share, from ’ $11,957,646, or 38 cents a share, in the nine months to Dec. 31, 1962. Sales totaled ` $938,224,805 compared with S890.637,274 in the prior year's period. Mr. Vickers attributed the upward trend in earnings mainly to improvement in results of the Univac and Remington office equipment divisions, coupled with higher profits from other product lines such as farm machinery and hydraulic equipment. Shipments under United States Government contracts are about the same as last year's level, Mr. Vickers said. The backlog of such orders on Dec. 31 approximated $530 nmillion compared with 8533 million three months earlier. Libby, McNeill & Libby, large Chicago food packer, reported yesterday a net income of $3,418,012, or 71 cents a share, for the fiscal six months ended Dec. 28.

172-> Assault on Hiring of T eachers Called ‘Full of Inaccuracies’
The Board of Examiners of the city school system yesterday answered the caustic criticism IeveIed at it last fall in a New York University survey of teacher preparation, recruitment, hiring and promotion practices. The examiners contended in a statement that the study, which had been made at the request of the Board of Education, was “worthless, full of serious errors and inaccuracies and based on faulty samplings.” The N.Y.U. survey, titled “Teacher Mobility in New York City,” dealt with personnel practices in the public schools, but aimed its main barbs at the examiners. It was conducted by a research team of the N.Y.U. Center for Social Services. The Board of Examiners noted that the survey was one of a series of administrative studies here over the last two years at a cost of $250,000. The N.Y.U. study was supported by a $50,000 grant from the State Education Department. The examiners said: “The time has come to state emphatically that a net effect of cumulative survey treatment is akin to character assassination. “Moreover, there is a shocking waste of time and effort in defending oneself. Time and effort had better be spent in the constant struggle for improvement of procedures.” At one point the survey charged the examiners with encouraging supervisory candidates to attend coaching sessions “since they [the examiners] feel that university courses in administration and supervision are not ‘practical’ enough.” The examiners answered that this was “a completely unfounded, false statement that has no merit and borders on libel.” To a charge that anyone—just “warm bodies” can teach in the city system, the examiners noted that, according to the N.Y.U. report itself, 60 per cent of the 40,000 teachers were supplied by the four city colleges, and the others by colleges and universities in the New York City area.

173-> HIGH COURT REJECTS AUTO TRADE‐IN CASE
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (AP) —The Supreme Court refused today to review a decision that New York City may apply its sales and use‐tax system differently to residents who buy outside the city than those who buy inside the city. The decision was by the New York State Court of Appeals. It was appealed to the Supreme Court by Milton E. Spatt, a resident of the city. The Supreme Court ruled that the case contained no substantial Federal question. Mr. Spatt bought a car for $8,500 in Nassau County in 1957. He traded in his used car for a credit of $4,900 and paid the balance in cash. Mr. Spatt took the car to New York City and paid a use tax of $100.50, computed on the cash amount of the purchase only. The City Controller claimed that $147 more was due and he was upheld by the state court. In his appeal, Mr. Spatt said that if he had made the same deal in the city, the sales tax would have been computed only on the $3,350 cash paid, whereas the use tax had been on the entire purchase price. By taxing residents of the city differently on the basis of the place of purchase, Mr. Spatt contended that the city regulation was arbitrary and discriminatory, that it violated the due‐process and equal‐protection‐of‐laws guarantees of the Constitution. The appeal said other cities in New York State, Kansas, Colorado, North Dakota and Mississippi had the same “discriminatory tax” regulations.

174-> City Installing New Route Signs at Bus Stops; Transit Agency Also Hopes to Improve Maps in Subway
The Transit Authority is going to the aid of passengers who believe they are embarking on an uncharted journey when they board a bus or subway car. It hopes to provide better signs, guideposts and maps. If the authority's plans succeed, New Yorkers and visitors may no longer have to trust to luck or experience to know where they are going. The agency began to install metal diagrams yesterday under some of the 2,500 bus‐stop signs in Manhattan. The diagrams list the route number of the bus, the streets the buses travel, their points of departure and their ultimate destination. If the experiment in Manhattan proves successful, it will be extended to bus lines in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. In addition. all the 4,000 buses run by the authority and its subsidiary, the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority, will have route number signs on their side and rear windows to supplement the main route and destination sign now displayed on the front bus window. The authority is also planning a revision of its subway maps, and it intends to install maps in its buses. It will install large, illuminated maps on all its 482 subway and elevated transit stations. To obtain better subway maps and maps for the buses, the au‐thority will soon invite map‐makers to submit designs. The planned improvement of the transit system's directional guides was announced by the authority yesterday at a press conference in its offices, 370 Jay Street, Brooklyn. “The above program is part of our continuing efforts to furnish passengers with clear directional transit information,” John J. Gilhooley, a member of the three‐man authority, said “We are striving to elimi‐nate any uncertainty that some riders may have as to which buses and subway trains to take to their destination,” he continued. In discussing the reason for the competition to obtain better maps, he said “we want to see if we can get a map that is more readable and intelligible than the one we now have. We want to get a map that will teach people to get rapidly to where they are going.” Mr. Gilhooley said that the improvements were being made as a result of requests from the public and in response to adverse newspaper comment on the present guides. He explained that when the present subway map was installed in 1958 it won a certificate for excellent design and production from the American Lnstitute of Graphic Arts. Mr. Gilhooley added that even if the competition provided no improvement over the maps now in use, maps would nonetheless be installed on the stations. In connection with buses, he said, he did not know whether a map could be devised that would encompass all of the 193 public bus lines in the five boroughs. If a citywide bus map is not feasible, borough maps will be installed on the buses. The metal diagrams .being installed on the 35 bus routes in Manhattan are 14 inches high and 8½ inches wide. They are being placed directly under the bus‐stop signs. Where there are several lines using the same streets, the routes are shown in different colors. Yellow arrows point out the location of the stop in relation to the entire route. The signs on stops used by one line will be in black and white. To enable passengers to identify buses quickly from the side and rear, route number with a white background and black numbers four inches high are being placed in the lower right hand corner of the window to the left of the bus front door as viewed from the outside and in the lower right corner of the back window.

175-> AUTO PRODUCTION SETS APRIL MARK; 785,000 Units Also Is Third Highest for Any Month
DETROIT, May 1 (UPI) —Auto records were set at a fast pace in April, Ward's Automotive Reports said today. Ward's estimated production at 785,000 units for the month, a high for any April and the third‐best output for any month. Truck output of 155,000 units was a record for any month and the combined car‐truck total of 940,000 was a record for any month. The industry was scheduled to turn out 179,504 cars this week, down slightly from 182,037 a week ago, but well ahead of the 163,719 cars made in the 1963 week. Truck production this week was estimated at 36,975 units. That compared with 36,017 last week and 30,785 in the 1963 week. For the year, the industry has built 2,969,199 cars and 580,338 trucks, compared with 2,728,462 cars and 513,022 trucks at this time last year. In April output of General Motors Corporation cars rose by 11 per cent to 427,046 from the 383,093 built a year earlier. This was a record for any month in G.M.'s history. Ford Motor Company produced 220,007 cars last month, an increase of 25.9 per cent above the 174,690 in April of last year. Last month Chrysler Corporation's output came to 99,065 cars, a rise of 24 per cent over the 79,842 of a year earlier. American Motors Corporation produced 40,104 cars in April, or 14 per cent less than the 46,732 in the 1963 month. In

176-> SCIENCE NOTES: NEW DRUG
Viruses are notoriously immune to drugs once infection has begun to spread in the body. One reason for this is that anything that will knock out a virus will most likely kill healthy cells, too, in which case the cure would literally be worse than the disease. However, two drugs with a certain amount of selective effectiveness against viruses have been found recently. One was found effective against snmallpox. Another was found to work against a viral infection of the eve. Last week, a third anti‐virus drug was added to the list. Called 1‐adamantanamine hydrochloride, it was reported by Dr. Herbert A. Wendell, a physician and pharmacologist of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.. to protect against influenza and may even be helpful in treating persons already ill with the infection. An installer of pipe insulation died in an Ohio hospital last March 6 after four days of a strange illness. He thought at first that glass wool from the insulation had become imbedded in his neck. However, the in‐ flammation spread to his head and chest. Blood cultures taken just before he died developed the bacillus of anthrax, a disease that besets cattle in Europe. Asia and Africa. Public health specialists examined the roll of hair‐felt with which the man had been working and insulation on the pipes that he had covered. In 9 of 15 samples the same bacillus was found. The felt contained imported goat hair. In reporting the incident last week the United States Public Health Service said it was the first American death from such an infection in at least 12 years. Penicillin is the most com mon cause of harmful allergic drug reactions. About two such reactions are thought to occur in every 100 courses of treatment with the antibiotic. For this reason—ana pecause the allergic reactions, thoughk usually only uncomfortable, cau be fatal—scientists have been looking for an adequate test to tell if a person is dangerously sensitive to the drug. What may be just such a test was reported on last week by Dr. Charles W. Parker of Washington University in St. Louis. The injection consists of a modified penicillin molecule with a string of amino acids attached. Administered subcutaneously, the test was said to reduce by 25 times the number of penicillin reactions.

177-> Ohioan Debates Communist Youths During Visit to a Russian Auto Factory
MOSCOW, May 4—A rugged Ohio individualist and collectively minded Soviet workers compared careers and life experiences today in a frank exchange at a Moscow automobile plant. Each side seemed to admire the other's achievements but came away from the confrontation with the conviction that its system was best. The discussicn with picked Communist youths was the’ highlight of a visit today to the Moskvich auto factory by James C. McKenzie, a 33‐yearold insurance man from Portsmouth, Ohio. Mr. McKenzie, his wife Carol, and their 14‐year‐old son, Philip, were invited by the plant management after they had played hosts to a Moskvich engineer, Viktor T. Pozdneyev, and his family last Christmas. The exchange project was initiated by the Portsmouth Junior Chamber of Commerce to promote Soviet‐American understanding. A representative of the chamber, Ronald McCowen, a Portsmouth lawyer, has accompanied the McKenzies to Moscow. Meeting at Factory Except for occasional greetings, the visitors had little occasion to meet with workers during a four‐hour tour of the auto plant until they were ushered into a conference room where a dozen bright and attractive representatives of the 2,000member unit of the Komsomol (Young Communist League) were waiting for them. Volodya Platonov, the Komsomol unit chief, said young people made up about 40 per cent of the plant's total labor force of 16,000 and that it the job of the Young Communists to set the example in work, study and recreation. “Our task is to help raise production to ever higher levels,” he said. Mr. McKenzie, a six‐footer with a crew cut and easy manner, asked how Soviet young people went about looking for a job. Oleg Gusev, a 30‐year‐old engineer, said that after graduation from the 10‐year school he had done military service for three years. He then sought a job at the Moskvich plant because he “always loved automobiles.” He was given the job of lathe operator. Mr. Gusev attended a tuitionfree automotive engineering college at night and was promoted successively to more skilled jobs as he advanced at school. Last year he received his engineer's diploma. “Can anyone get a job at this plant ?” Mr. McKenzie asked. “We have a help wanted sign out all the time,” was the reply. Mr. McKenzie was then asked how he had become a successful businessman and the co‐owner of an insurance brokerage firm “My father was a railroad worker and there was no money in my family,” the representative of the capitalist West told the Communist youths. “I had my first job at the age of 14 as a railroad laborer during summer vacations while I attended high school.” After graduation, Mr. McKenzie continued, he first worked as a locomotive fireman but soon turned to the insurance field “when I saw the high standard of living of a life insurance salesman I knew.” This profession is virtually unknown in the Soviet Union, where no one tries to sell life insurance to anyone. After having worked for a large life insurance company, Mr. McKenzie said, he invested his savings in the insurance brokerage firm. “It took me four years to pay off,” he added. The young Soviet workers seemed puzzled. “Here in the Soviet Union we usually help one another to advance,” one said. “Did you have any assistance or did you make it on your own ?” Mr. McKenzie said: “As you know we have no collectivism in the United States and it is up to the individual to get ahead.” When asked about Mrs. McKenzie's profession, her husband said she had never worked but “I think she has a full‐time job with a house and five children.” The discussion ended on a joint expression of hope for more family exchanges between the Soviet Union and the United States. “We want millions of young people like you to come to the United States,” Mr. McKenzie told the workers, “not just to view the cold, hard concrete, but to spend time in American homes.” Last year fewer than 100 Soviet tourists visited the United States.

CALCUTTA, India, March 20 —A train carrying Hindu refugees from East Pakistan to a rehabilitation site in Central India has ignited a trail of death across the states of Bihar, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. Fellow Hindus who gathered at railroad stations to see the refugees were inflamed by the migrants' accounts of maltreat'ment by Pakistanis. At Jamshedpur in Bihar nearly 400 sympathizers returning from the railroad station tried to loot and burn several shops belonging to Moslems. They killed a police officer and injured several men when the police tried to curb them.

185-> The Merchant's Point of View; Question Is Raised Whether Tax Cut Helped Stores; Lack of Big Buying Puts. Down Fears of Inflation
Businessmen are asking whether the reduction in tax rates early last month has brought about an increase in retail volume. The picture has not been too clear owing to the fact that the increment to disposable consumer income had come shortly before Easter, a time when expenditures would normally rise. More recently, some analysts have come to the conclusion that the tax cut has not stimulated sales significantly and they point to what they call “sluggish” retail sales in March and April. They argue that there have been no “explosive” results from reductions in taxation. On the other hand, the fact that the public has not gone on a spending spree must be viewed as a constructive development, one that quiets the fear that runaway inflation is imminent. Anticipation of a larger Federal deficit also was an inflationary factor to be considered, according to the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago. The Treasury had estimated that there would be a reduction in withholding amounting to $800 million a month as a result of the 4 per cent cut. So far, it has not come about. Federal tax receipts are higher than they were a year ago, probably as a result of a prosperous 1963 with higher earnings, employment and capital gains, and because there are cautious wage earners who voluntarily raised their withholding to eliminate the need of making large cash payments next April 15. Business concerns also have raised their estimated pay ments and higher corporate payments have added to the Treasury receipts. Even though Federal expenses have gone up despite efforts to economize, it would appear that the anticipated higher deficits in the budget have not materialized as predicted. There is a belief in some quarters that the moderate gains made in retail sales since the beginning of March are not the result of the tax cut. The early Easter stimulated buying last month and the percentage of gains over March 1963, these observers say, is not sufficiently high to attribute them to anything but seasonal factors. The one factor that would seem to negate such a conclusion is the fact that sales in the last two weeks have shown very substantial gains over year‐ago figures, gains that normally would not have been as large without the stimultaion from lower taxation. A. W. Zelomek, consulting economist, points out that the current rate of spending suggests that spending for the balance of the year will be at a higher level. He notes that sales of general merchandise, in particular, have been affected by unseasonable weather rather than economic con ditions. Analyzing spending patterns in the first quarter, Mr. Zelomek said they revealed some interesting tendencies. Among them were the continthe favorable showing on furniture and appliances, the good‐size gains of stores in the general merchandise group, and the better showing of stores featuring higher‐price merchandise compared to those selling medium to lower‐price goods. Savings have benefited from the tax cut, too. In the last seven weeks, savings deposits have been running about 2 per cent ahead of January and February. Major appliance sales in the first two months of the year were running well over 12 per cent, according to the index calculated by Fairchild Publications. Figures for March have not been tabulated and there is reason to believe that the gains in the Easter month will not be as good as they were in January or February. But there appears to be a good recovery in appliance sales in April, particularly in the items that move well in warm weather — refrigerators, air conditioners and the like. The opening of the World's Fair in New York has focused the attention of retailers on the growing tendency to travel. New York merchants feel that they will benefit from the influx of millions of visitors. But the travelers will not arrive with empty suitcases. Merchants in the areas where they live also will have had a hand in outfitting and equipping the vacationers headed for New York, and for other places. The American Society of Travel Agents estimates that Americans spent $17.4 billion on travel within the United States in 1963. This figure includes both business and holiday travel. In addition, it is estimated that Americans spent $3 billion abroad. Yet, it is estimated that only one‐third of the population took a vacation trip last year. This year the Fair in New York as well as other tourist attractions throughout the nation should induce a large number of persons to travel. The American Express Company estimates that 2,750,000 Americans will go abroad this year, excluding trips to Canada and Mexico, an estimated 10 per cent increase over the number of American tourists who traveled beyond the North American continent last year. There should be as good an increase in travel within the hemisphere boundaries, according to travel consultants.

186-> Art: Pollock's Searching for a Symbol; Seldom‐Seen Works in New Exhibition; Show at Marlborough Has 152 Paintings
ONE of the paintings in the Jackson Pollock exhibition opening tonight at the‐Marlborough Gerson Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, with a benefit preview for the benefit of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children, bears the title “Search for a Symbol.” Painted in 1943, “Search for a Symbol” might justly have been borrowed as the title for the whole show, which is better as an examination of Pollock's early work than as a display of the brief period when he found himself and produced the big, confident, high‐swinging paintings that justify his reputation. The exhibtion will open to the public tomorrow, to run until Feb. 15, with an admission fee of $1 to benefit the charitable organization. It is a show worth a dollar to anyone who is curious about Jackson Pollock, as anyone who is interested in contemporary painting is bound to be. Only after one leaves the show, and begins thinking it over, does the realization come that as a true summary of Pollock's achievement it falls short, even though it is the largest Pollock show ever held. With a strong selection from Pollock's early years, the Marlborough‐Gerson show builds up to the climax of his great years, skids across them, and introduces us to the artist's gropings toward a new figurative manner just before his death in 1956. Seen against foreknowledge of his explosive fulfillment, this is a good show, with the virtue of lining up a great deal of seldom exhibited work. But anyone who is not already thoroughly familiar with the best of Pollock may wonder what all the excitement has been about. This is not to say that the representation of the great years is totally inadequate, but it is weak. If he had painted only what is shown here, Pollock could have become the most potent influence on American abstract painting and the prototype of the action‐painting division of abstract expressionism. (The Dallas Museum of Fine Arts's “Cathedral,” of 1947, which had not arrived for the preview, will do something to fill the gap.) So much for the exhibition's shortcoming. To its credit there are 152 works “valued in excess of million” for those who need this yardstick, running from 1934 to 1956. They show Pollock searching for his symbol by looking back at American romanticism, stringing along with Bentonesque regionalism, learning from the Mexican expressionists, and having his fling with Picasso. As late as 1945 you might still have thought that there was not much hope that this artist would ever become completely his own man. But when discovery came, it came with a gush in the huge paintings that were literally flung onto the canvases—symbols of the wild energy and the bizarre convulsions of our century.

188-> F.C.C. DENIES PLEA
WASHINGTON, April 29 —The Federal Communications Commission declined today to reconsider a decision affecting the Austin, Tex., television station owned by President Johnson's family. The commission unanimously decided to stick by a rule that a community‐antenna company that is in effect competing with the Johnson station must delay certain programs at the station's request. There have been insinuations that the F.C.C. ruling, made last December, showed favoritism to the Johnson interests. Today's opinion did not mention that charge directly, but it indicated the commissioners’ sensitivity to the political accusation. The commission said that its undeviating, “established practice” had been to make community‐antenna systems defer to local stations. It said the rule had been “uniformly followed” in 20 cases — thus, by implication, rejecting the insinuation of special treatment here. The F.C.C. is concerned about the impact of community‐antenna. systems on local stations. The systems of high antennae are set up in towns that have only one or two stations to pick up programs from other cities. Austin has only one television station. A general rule‐making proceeding is now under way in the F.C.C. to decide what limits should be put on the antenna systems. Pending the completion of this proceeding, the commission has imposed a general freeze on community‐antenna systems operating by microwave. It is only over such microwave systems that the F.C.C. has authority. Any community‐antenna company can escape the freeze during this interim period by agreeing to certain conditions. One is that, if asked by a local station, it will delay broadcast of a program that the station plans to carry later. TV Cable of Austin, the company whose petition was rejected today, agreed last July to accept the conditions. It cannot carry any programs that the Johnson station, KTBCTV, has broadcast in the last 15 days or will broadcast within the next 15. Last September, TV Cable asked the F.C.C. to waive this delay requirement. Its reason was that it faced competition from another community‐antenna company that was not subject to the delay. This other company, Capital Cable, operates entirely by direct wire and thus is not subject to F.C.C. restrictions. The Johnson station has an option to acquire 50 per cent of Capital Cable's stock any time during the next two years. Last December, the commission turned down TV Cable's waiver application. The company then came in with a petition for reconsideration that attacked the relationship between KTBC and Capital Cable. TV Cable demanded that the commission look into the option agreement. It said it should not have to compete, under the restrictions of the delay rule, with another antenna company that was unrestricted and had such close relations with Austin's only television station. Today, the F.C.C. said that it had studied the option agreement and could find nothing in it relevant to the present issue. The opinion did note, however, that the commission was studying the general desirability of letting stations own antenna companies, so KTBC could be barred from taking up the option. The commission said there was no reason to make a special exception in Austin to its national rule making regulated‐antenna systems delay duplicated programs. It said the decision on the wisdom of that general rule would be made in its over‐all, national communty‐antenna proceeding. The opinion also suggested that TV Cable was in no position to complain because it had accepted the condition originally, knowing at the time that it would face competition from Capital Cable. This was the sole ground of a concurring opinion by Commissioner Robert T. Bartley. Commissioner Lee Loevinger, who opposes restrictions on community antennas, nevertheless concurred today. He said TV Cable had shown no new ground to justify reconsideration, and he suggested that the company's purpose was to stimulate “unwarranted publicity.” President Johnson's wife and two daughters own 84 per cent of the stock in KTBC. It has been put in trusteeship while Mr. Johnson is President, but it will revert afterward to the family.

190-> ‘MERRY WIVES’ GIVEN BY OPERA WORKSHOP
There are enough virtues for two performances of The Merry Wives of Windsor” in the production given last night at Hunter College Assembly Hall by the Opera Workshop of the college. And so it's a fair bet that tomorrow's repeat of the Nicolai opera, same place, same auspices, will be the same pleasure that last night's was. The essentials were present: cheerful staging, good acting, light, natural‐sounding voices, inventive sets and sympathetic orchestral support under the baton of William Tarrasch. The voices were too light at times—or the orchestra was too heavy—and so some words of the English translation were lost And there was a tendency to rush too quickly from one musical episode to the next. But these were minor matters indeed in a production so good‐natured and intelligent. Carolyn Lockwood's directing managed to join the demands of theater and of singing in fresh fashion, and in a way that complemented the music beautifully. All principals were bright and young Outstanding were Rita Shane Tritter as Mrs. Alice Ford, David Bender as Fenton, Joseph Fair as a mighty Falstaff, Ted Lambrinos as Mr. Ford and - Diana Catani as Ann Page. Of -these, only Mr. Fair repeats his role tomorrow.

191-> EXTREMISM STIRS BUSINESS DEBATE; Heller of Economic Council Sees Rise in Moderation in Economy Scene; CAREY ISSUES WARNING; Chamber of Commerce Head Urges an Awareness of ‘Calculating’ View
WASHINGTON, May 10—The chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Walter W. Heller, believes that extremism in economics is waning. The new president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, Walter F. Carey, warns of “an alarming increase in extremism” in politics, business, religion and labor. Mr. Heller's observations seemed to be part of the Administration's anti‐inflation effort to soothe labor‐management relations and maintain the pace of the economy. Mr. Carey was exhorting “moderates” to be less moderate about their moderation—“to stop shaking our heads or clucking our tongues” and to oppose extremism “actively, fearlessly and, if need be, militantly.” If that is a paradox, the 58year‐old Birmingham, Mich., trucking company executive said, “So be it.” Heller Offers Views Both men, as it happened, spoke last Wednesday. Mr. Heller addressed the Advertising Council, and Mr. Carey spoke before the National Highway Users Conference. Mr. Heller offered the following points: ¶Labor is seeing wages not simply as purchasing power, but also as cost. ¶Business is recognizing a public responsibility in price setting. ¶Liberals are recognizing the essential role of higher investments—and therefore of greater profits — in economic growth, health and balance‐of‐payments success. ¶Conservatives are more and more accepting the proposition that Government can influence the economy through aggressive fiscal and monetary policy—without destroying, endangering or even in any way limiting freedom of economic choice. pened' Minds do not mean to say that we are on the threshold of a millennium to economic policy making,” Mr. Heller added, “but minds have opened on both sides of ihe political and doctrinal fence.” Avoidance of extremes, he said, has contributed to the length — 38 months — and the comparative price stability of the present upswing in the economy. Mr. Carey said that the majorities in business and government consisted of “reasonable and moderate” people, but he clearly was more worried about extremism than Dr. Heller was. He,was not, he said, talking about the inevitable handful of “genuine and zealots and crackpots,” who “can be ignored, or pitied.”

192-> WEEK AT FAIR ASKED FOR SENIOR CITIZENS
Members of organizations for elderly people met yesterday to petition for a “Senior Citizens' Week” at the World's Fair. They urged that entry fees during this period be reduced to 25 cents. Speaking before a lively audience of 250 persons in their 60's, 70's and 80's, Zalman J. Lichtenstein, the director of the Senior Citizens Golden Ring Council, told of a request he had made to Robert Moses, “as one senior citizen to another.” In a letter to the fair's president he asked that a week be set aside, some time after Labor Day, “when all the visitors have left.” Mr. Lichtenstein explained to his listeners that an elderly visitor would not be able to get around as quickly as younger persons and so would have to return to the fair many times “to get even a taste of it.” Also present at the meeting. held at the Atran Center, 25 East 78th Street, were Representatives Leonard Farbstein. Democrat of Manhattan, and Seymour Halpern, Republican of Queens. Both pledged their support for the proposal. But Mr. Farbstein said he had written to Mr. Moses sugeesting such a plan and received a reply saying that this “could not and would not be done.”

193-> A'S OWNER WIDENS KMSAS CITY RIFT; Finley Says to City Council: You Have Lost Our Team
KANSAS CITY, Jan. 3 (UPI) —Charles O. Finley, the owner of the Kansas City Athletics, today told the city that it no longer had a major league franchise. Finley, who broke off negotiations on a new lease for Municipal Stadium, said he would request a meeting cf other American League club owners Jan. 14 in New York. “As the situation stands at this moment, Kansas City does not have a major league franchise and the Athletics have no place to play,” said Finley. Finley refused to comment on whether he would ask the League for permission to move his franchise. Approval of seven other club owners is required to make a move. “It seems to me that Mr. Finley cannot, by himself, say that Kansas City no longer has a baseball franchise,” said Mayor Ilus W. Davis. Finley's warning came today after the City Council had rejected another lease proposal he made. In turn, Finley rejected a compromise proposal made by the city. Davis proposed a basic lease of four or five years and said the city would negotiate on options with Finley. Previously, the city had refused to consider ontions. The terms of the city's basic lease proposal‐5 per cent of paid attendance and 7.5 per cent of concession revenue—were the same terms proposed by Finley today. But Finley's proposal was for two years, with no options. Davis said such a short‐term lease would keep alive “the threat that has hung over the city for some years—that the baseball club will be moved.” Davis said the city could not settle for any lease of less than four or five years. “Well, you're not going to get it. What do you think about that?” said Finley. He then walked out of the meeting.

196-> Insurance Agents Expel Figure in Baker Inquiry
WASHINGTON, May 6 (UPI) —Don B. Reynolds, the insurance agent who injected President Johnson's name into the Robert G. Baker investigation, has been expelled from the Washington area's biggest professional life insurance organization. Paul Gibson, president of the District of Columbia Life Underwriters Association, confirmed today that Mr. Reynolds was expelled last Monday for “conduct unbecoming a member of the association.” Mr. Reynolds, of suburban Silver Springs, Md., had been accused of making rebates from insurance commissions to Mr. Baker, former secretary to the Senate Democratic majority, who resigned under fire last October. Mr. Reynolds denied the accusation.

197-> Man in the News; Again the Tiger; Carmine Gerard De Sapio
DURING a debate last fall, Carmine Gerard De Sapio asked a political opponent to put out his cigarette, “because I'm not accustomed to smoke‐filled rooms.” Which may be. But Mr. De Sapio became a symbol of big city, machine boss politics during the 12 years he led Tammany Hall and dominated the New York State Democratic party. Although he has been deprived of all real power, Reform Democrats, editorial writers and Mayor Wagner, who replaced him as New York's No. 1 Democrat, still do not regard Mr. Desapio as a toothless tiger. but as a threat. Yesterday's Court of Appeals decision ordering a new election for district leader in the First Assembly District South gives Mr. De Sapio more chance to re‐establish a political base by winning election as a district leader. Mr. De Sapio was toppled from his position as “boss” of the New York party in 1961 by a coalition of reform Democrats — Mayor Wagner, and the Kennedy Administration. W'ith Insurance Firm Since then Mr. De Sapio has continued to hold the job of Democratic National Committeeman from New York because he had been elected to a four‐year term of office in 1960. He has attended about three meetings of the National Committee each year, but he no longer brings any personal power into those meetings. For three years he has kept in touch with major political colleagues only in private. He has been drawing a salary as an executive at Jay B. Rappaport & Co., general insurance concern, which he joined in 1959 after ending a term as Secretary of State of New York. Mr. De Sapio has also continued to nurture and lead his Tamawa Democratic club in Greenwich Village and to work for the interests of the Village. He has taken part in such causes as the rerouting of buses out of Washington Square and in neighborhood attempts to reduce the number of bohemian coffee houses. His interest in the neighborhood is life‐long. Mr. De Sapio was born in a house near Varick and Grand Streets Dec. 10, 1908. His parents, Gerard and Marie, still live in the area. He worked as a boy for his father's trucking business. Mr. De Sapio went to St. Alphonsus School, Fordham Prep, Fordham University and Brooklyn Law School. Mr. De Sapio's first job was a secretary to a City Court justice. He rose to First District leader in 1943 and New York County leader in 1949. By 1953 he was choosing Robert F. Wagner Jr. for Mayor. In 1954, he played a major role in electing W. Averell Harriman Governor. But the man whom friends called “The Bishop” was also making enemies. Mr. De Sapio's fall from power as a kingmaker began when he engineered the nomination of District Attorney Frank S. Hogan for the United States Senate in 1958, against the wishes of Mr. Wagner and Mr. Harriman. It was completed when Mr. De Sapio tried, but failed, to prevent Mayor Wagner's nomination for a third term in 1961. In his youth, Mr. De Sapio contracted an eye disease called iritis. This condition, which forced him to wear dark glasses, had a lot to do with his public relations problems. The dark glasses gave him a somehow sinister appearance to those who saw him in news pictures and on nationwide television as floor leader of New York delegations at Democratic national conventions. For his primary fight last fall, Mr. De Sapio tried out much lighter tinted glasses in public appearances. He observed that the old dark glasses were “no asset to a political leader.” Now his countenance has weathered. His wavy black hair has . thinned; white now at the sides, but neatly parted and still fluffing. His voice is soft, modulated. His wide, thin‐lipped mouth has a somewhat mournful turn. He retains his habitual elegance. A handkerchief always peeps from his breast pocket. His shoes have a mirror luster. Last September Mr. De Sapio made a “pledge” not to try to regain leadership of Tammany Hall if he were elected district leader. However, many politicians believe that he would find the temptation hard to resist. For he had also said that “Maybe, if I were to get back in, maybe we will sit down—the city and state leaders — and unify this party, which would not be a difficult thing to do.” Mr. De Sapio is married to the former Theresa Natale of Hoboken. They have a daughter, Geraldine De Sapio. Mr. De Sapio's sport is swimming.

198-> St. John's Defeats Purdue's Oarsmen
PELHAM MANOR, N. Y., !March 24—The new Olympic rowing course on Orchard Beach Lagoon was put through its first formal test early this evening in races between eightoared crews of St John's University ä.nd Purdue Rowing by moonlight over the 2,000‐meter straightaway on which the United States Olympic trials will be held in July and August, the St. John's varsity won by almost a length. Shadowy figures pulling their sweeps silently in the dark and cold through almost dead calm water and hardly distinguishable from a following launch, the crews were caught in the lights of motor cars near the finish line and were acclaimed with cheers and raucous horns. The winning time was 7 minutes 8 seconds, clocked from a floating start. Purdue, a combination of varsity heavyweights and lightweights and freshmen oarsmen, was caught in 7:11.4. In a preliminary freshman race, Purdue’ was the winner in 7:08.6. Its margin of victory was 30.4 seconds more than seven lengths. The course over which the crews rowed, starting in Pelham Manor and stretching for almost its entirety in the Bronx, is not yet completed. The dredges that blasted out a small island of almost solid rock to extend the old lagoon waterway in a straight line for the full 2,000 meters, suspended cleaning out operations to make way for the races. It will be another week or 10 days before the dredging is completed in the lagoon, an inlet of Long Island Sound. Floats and lane marker buoys will not be in operation until May 2, when the dedication ceremonies will be held. The judges’ stands, with their three tiers for officials, photo‐timers, press, television and radio, are scheduled to be installed by. July 1. When completed the course will represent an outlay of $750,000. It is the first in American waters to be built to international standards and specifications of the International Rowing Federation. With its electronic timing devices, movable starting platforms, individual lane buoys for the entire 2,000 meters and other appurtenances, it will rival Switzerland's famous Rotsee in Lucerne and other European courses,

LONG BRANCH, N. J., April 28—Isador Horowitz, chairman of the board of the Progressive Life Insurance Company, which has its home offices in Red Bank, died at Monmouth Medical Center here last night after a brief illness. He was 70 years old. Mr. Horowitz, who developed the company from a small burial aid society into a thriving life underwriting firm with offices throughout the East, had been president from 1934 to 1963. He had been associated with the company for almost 50 years and was active in civic and charitable affairs in this area. He leaves his wife, Mrs, Rose Horowitz, a daughter, Mrs. Joseph J. Sear; a brother, James; five sisters, Mrs. Louis Feinberg, Mrs. Charles I. Garfinkle, Mrs. Herman Fox, Rose and Jennie, and two grandchildren.

201-> A Sure Thing: Happy Birthday; Jan. 1 Is Universal Date of Birth for Race Horses
Like all racing horses, the above steeds celebrated their birthdays last Wednesday on the first day of the year. Those born in January of 1963 actually were a year old. Those born in December—if any—were chronologically less than a month old. But the universal birthdate simplifies procedures for foal registration, naming and eventual entrance into races designated for specific age groups. Horses are bred in the late spring and early summer so that the foals are dropped in the early part of the following year. Horses develop quickly, and a few months can be crucial in their readiness for the races. For this reason, owners have been known to hide illegally a foal born in the latter part of a year and not announce his birth until early January. By the end of the year after the horse is born, the owner must file a written request to The Jockey Club for approval of the yearling's name. The name must be no more than 16 letters long (which includes punctuation and space between words), no more than three words. The names cannot be those of a famous horse; a horse in action within the past 15 years; a com mercial product, or a living person without written consent. It cannot have off‐color connotations, cannot be that of an illustrious or notorious person. At least 50 per cent of all first requests are denied. “Some people take great delight in trying to get obscene foreign words, trade names, copyrighted titles past my desk,” sniffed a lady at The Jockey Club recently. But with more than 50,000 names on file, the most common reason for rejection is duplication. The acknowledged master of horse naming is Alfred G. Vanderbilt, who combines elements of the sire's and dam's name. One of his masterpieces: Singing Wood, by Royal Minstrel out of Glade.

203-> Man in the News; Mr. Methodist Charles Coolidge Parlin
PITTSBURGH, May 1— If there was any question yesterday that Charles Coolidge Parlin deserved the title “Mr. Methodist,” it was answered in the affirmative today. The 65‐year‐old corporation lawyer was unruffled and unwrinkled this morning as he completed a two‐day, nine‐hour stint on the glatform at the Methodist Church's quadrennial general conference.. Under his general ship, a plan designed to abolish the church's all‐Negro, nongeographic Central Jurisdiction in four years was overwhelmingly approved. Mr. Parlin's opposition was small but formidable, seeking an immediate end to the all‐Negro jurisdiction. Behind the scenes there were assertions that his orderly, legalistic approach smacked of compromise and gradualism in a day when the church could not afford even a semblance of segregation. He insists, however, that he is as anxious as his critics to achieve integragtion. Any precipitate action would have “blown the church apart,” he said. Well groomed and ramrod straight, he speaks in a precise, almost clipped speech, that is sometimes enough to awe even the toughest debater. Mr. Parlin does not confine his church activities to Methodism. He is one of six presidents of the World Council of Churches and is probably the best‐known layman in all Protestantism. True to his Methodist heritage, he neither smokes nor drinks. Mr. Parlin is an avowed ecumenist, favoring more and more interchurch friendliness and cooperation. He was a major supporter of the move to bring the Russian Orthodox Church into the World Council. He is also vice president of the World Methodist Council, secretary of the Methodist Commission on Church Union and a member of the General Board of the National Council of Churches. He was a member of the nine‐man delegation of the National Council that visited the Soviet Union in March, 1956, at the invitation of the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. Outside the pew, Mr. Parin has an equally impressive list of interests. He is senior member of the law firm of Shearman & Sterling of New York. Its field is taxation, corporate finance, banking and international law. His directorships include the Celanese Corporation of America, the First National City Bank of New York and Guerlain, Inc. He is a trustee of American University in Washington. Drew University in Madison, N. J., Union Theological Seminary in New York and Bethune‐Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Fla. Mr. Parlin was born in Warsau, Wis., July 22, 1898. In 1924 he married Miriam Boyd. They have three children, Charles Coolidge Parlin 2d, Mrs. Harold N. Smith and Blackwood Boy Parlin. He is remotely related to the late President Calvin Coolidge. Mr. Parlin is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Law School. The Parlins live at 123 Hillside Avenue, Englewood, N. J. Some years ago Mr. Parlin defended the late Methodist Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam before the Houee Committee on un‐American Activities. An amateur photographer, Mr. Parlin has two darkrooms, one in his New Jersey home and another in his summer residence on Lake George. He collects stamps and owns one of the few perfect German sets. His father, Charles Coolidge Parlin, is a member of the Advertising Hall of Fame and is credited with founding market analysis procedures.

204-> ARTISTE's SELF‐STUDY; Patricia Neal Reflects on Her Life And a Career Now at Its Pinnacle
“I FIND it so difficult to talk about acting,” said the tall redhead with the unmistakable, husky voice. Patricia Neal grinned as she added, “I can't even finish a sentence.” She can, and judging by “Hud,” she knows all there is to know about acting. On a recent cold afternoon, during a brief flying visit from her home in England, the 38‐year‐old native Southerner obligingly took inventory, professional and personal. That night —the purpose of her trip—she was to receive her New York Film Critics award for the best performance by an actress in 1963. And what about an Oscar ? “I'd rather have this. You win an Oscar, your price goes up and nobody wants you.” Miss NeaI is a warm, candid person with sensitive eyes and no pretensions. Wearing a head kerchief and a maternity dress ,(her fourth child is due next spring), she perched comfortably in her hotel room and reflected on past, present and future. Hers is a life—and career — curiously blending deep personal agony and reward, that of her marriage to Roald Dahi, the British writer, with their two living children. It has been a long, often rough road from Kentucky to Broadway, to Hollywood and now home, a tiny village midway between Oxford and London. The Awful Truth “Alma, the housekeeper in ‘Hud,'was real to me from the time I first read the script. Paul Newman sent it to me with a letter. I told Marty Ritt, our director, I'd do it, but I was strictly a family gal. I came over for four weeks of shooting, down in Texas; then went back home for three; then came back for four more weeks on the Coast. My best bit, and the thing I loved the most about Alma, hit the cutting‐room floor.” She smiled. “Naturally.” “It was a scene where the young boy comes out to her cabin and asks Alma what life is all about anyway. ‘Honey,'she tells him, ‘you'll just have to ask someone else.'” Miss Neal signed at Warners at the age of 21, shortly after her Broadway triumph in “Another Part of the Forest.” She left Hollywood six years and thirteen films later, brokenhearted. “My career hadn't gone well, I couldn't relax in front of the camera and I was trying too hard.” Reminded that there had been rumors of a deep romantic involvement with a famous actor, now deceased, she nodded. “Oh yes. That, even more than my career, did me in. I got myself into a sticky mess which couldn’ t work, didn't work and never should have worked.” Miss Neal strolled to the window and looked out at the Metropolitan Museum. “He was the most gorgeously attractive man—bright, too, although some people didn't think so. I lived this secret life for several years. I was so ashamed, yet there was the fact of it. I had made few close friends. All I had, there in Hollywood, was that one love.” Asked where she and Mr. Dahi met, she turned cheerfully. “At a party here at Lillian Hellman's. I loathed him at first, then I got tired of lying when he phoned, then I was crazy about him and have been ever since. He's quite a person.” A phone call to the Dahl's Manhattan apartment in 1959 spelled a daytime nightmare. (The actress at that time was appearing on Broadway at the mother of young Helen Keller in “The Miracle Worker.” The baby carriage of fourmonth‐old Thneo Dahl, wheeled by a nurse, had been crushed between a taxi and a bus. “Imagine the effect on our Tessa, who'll be 7 in April, seeing him knocked clean across Madison Avenue and riding to the hospital with screaming sirens. Then the effect of seeing her older sister, our Olivia, dead in one afternoon last year, of measles. After that, my husband couldn't write for a long time. He's all right now, though,” she added, pointing to an opened box of ledgers she had bought for him here. “Yes, he writes in longhand.” “So,” Miss Neal said pleasantly, “we're very much country people. My husband has a large family, all near us. Our little Theo has had eight craniotomies and wore a tube attached to his head until recently but now it 's gone—he walks, runs and talks nonstop. He's a darling child, really. And we've sx acres of orchards, one dog and an aviary of parakeets.” Asked if she felt that fate had deepened her professional work on screen, stage and television, Miss Neal shot backs “It's been like a Greek tragedy; hasn't it?” And she smiled.

206-> News Analysis; President's TV Ordeal; Scorer Gives Johnson No Runs, Hits Or Errors, With Issues Left Stranded
WASHINGTON, Feb. 29 —President Johnson achieved his major objective in his first live televised news conference today: He survived. He approached this ordeal like a man going to the gallows. He insisted, from the first day he entered the White House, that the TV was not his medium, and he was right. But he got through today's assignment in good order: No runs, no hits, no errors—and several issues left stranded. Lyndon Johnson is a talker rather than a performer. The more natural he is, the more impressive he is, and the smaller the room the better. So he was out of his natural element today. The New State Department building, where the conference was held, is as antiseptic as a hospital. When . you go into it, you almost expect to hear somebody say on the loudspeaker: “Dr. Johnson wanted in surgery, please.” And the International Conference Room, where the President recited, is one of those big square half‐acre, windowless I.B.M. rooms where the air, the sound and everything else comes out of a pipe President Johnson, who used to charge through the swinging doors of the Senate, scattering page boys in his wake, almost slipped into this operating chamber today. He was dressed in television blue—suit, shirt and striped tie—and he came prepared. First, a sheaf of appointments: Bill Bundy, a favorite of reporters, to be Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern affairs; John T. McNaughton to replace Mr. Bundy as Assistant Secretary of Defense; Daniel M. Luevano to be Assistant Secretary of the Army; Mrs. Frankie Muse Freeman, a lawyer, to be on the Civil Rights Commission. And then a surprise. One of this country's closest held secrets has been the development of a high‐flying, extremely fast successor to the famous U‐2 sky spy plane When Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara began to be criticized as a big rocket man who hated manned aeroplanes, there was pressure to disclose the fact that this new plane, the A‐11, had been tested successfully. Such disclosure was opposed on the ground that one day, in a crisis, the country might use such a plane to the surprise of any enemy, so why tell the world about it? Why, indeed? But the President announced it, anyway, explanation undisclosed. All this he read out in a drone, as if he were determined to be slow and casual about the whole affair. Besides, as every President knows, the more you talk in these journalistic inquisitions, the fewer questions you have to answer. He took his time. It was the same with his answers to questions. When a man's name was mentioned, he gave you the fellow's biography. The President is a cautious man with a sure instinct for danger: He didn't exactly filibuster at the conference, but he managed to give a maximum of background and a minimum of news. Nevertheless, the conference indicated a number of things, including just how far a politican will go to keep the television networks happy. It also demonstrated the Johnson political technique. This is, primarily, to minimize or evade trouble. One reporter mentioned those two terrible words, “Bobby Baker.” Mr. Johnson quickly tossed Bobby to the Senators, remembering to express confidence that they, in some mysterious fashion, would take “proper action.” Another reporter mentioned all the speculation about carrying the war to North Vietnam; which the Administration itself had inspired. M,r. Johnson thought speculation was “a great disservice” and pessimism even worse. Panama? All he wanted was to be fair. Southeast Asia ? All we wanted was peace. The outlook for the future? “I am an optimist ... I am encouraged and I'm not pessimistic.” Would he debate with his oppponent in the Presidential election, and was it true that he had speculated on Richard Nixon as his opponent? No, said he, he hadn't speculated on whether he'd run for President or even who he'd run against “if I do run.” This he said without even a flicker or a smile. What did he mean by saying last week that the Communists were playing a “dangerous game” in Vietnam, and what had he intended by that phrase? He intended, by saying it was a dangerous game, to imply that it was a dangerous game. “That's what I said, and what I meant.” He was patient, courteous, cautious and verbose, and though he concentrated most of the time on what everybody knew, he made a better impression on the reporters in the room than he apparently did on those who saw him on television. Nevertheless, he is now over an ordeal he dreaded, and can now return to his small spontaneous conferences, where he is usually more effective.

207-> ART WORTH $750,000, LOST IN LONDON FIRE
LONDON, Jan. 13—Paintings worth up to $750,000. were de‐stroyed early today in an art gallery fire that may have been the work of an arsonist. The fire started in the basement of William Hallsborough Galleries and spread to the ground and first floors, destroying works by Van Dyck, Jan Van Goyen, Vuillard. François Boucher and Canaletto. It was believed that the fire was started by someone stuffing a burning object down a ventilator shaft. The Hallsborough Gallery was deep in rubble, with damaged or destroyed pictures on the floor and on walls. Lazar Herner, managing director of the gallery, picked up a sodden canvas or piece of car board and said, “That was a Fragonard drawing of the Tivolii. It was worth £5,000 ($14,000. A CanaIetto, “Via di Ripetto,” worth £35,000 ($98,000), remained on a first‐floor walI, a hole burned through the canvas. It was one of two Canalettos purchased recently at a Sotheby's auction sale. The other, “Palazzo del Quirinale,” was undamaged. Among the paintings destroyed, with estimated values, were Van Dyck's “Portrait of a Lady,” ($42,000); a Van Goyen landscape ($33,600) and Vuillard's “De Poêle à Pétrole,” ($56,000)

208-> Manhattan Still Remains the Attraction as the Tourists Start Pouring Into the City; RUSH OF TOURISTS EARLY THIS YEAR; World's Fair Credited With Drawing Crowds to City Earlier Than Usual; HOTELS NOTE INCREASE; 40,000 More Guests a Night Reported, but No Shortage of Rooms Is Expected
New York City is swelling these days, if not with pride, then with people. Drawn by the World's Fair and the city's tourist attractions, seasonal visitors are packing downtown Manhattan, the sightseeing tours and restaurants. Officials at the New York City Convention and Visitors' Bureau estimate that about 100,000 persons are normally registered in the city's hotels. In recent days, according to the bureau, the figure has averaged around 140,000. In a few weeks, when school is out, it is expected to reach 160,000. That many people in a city of eight million does not seem like much. But when they are crowded into the area south of 59th Street, where most of the tourists stay, the addition is noticeable. So far there has been no hotel space problem, nor, according to officials, is there likely to be. One reason is the togetherness of family groups arriving for the fair. Under normal conditions the average hotel room is occupied by 1.6 persons, but, according to the World's Fair housing bureau, the hotel room occupancy figure for fair groups is 2.43. Another reason that crowding is not expected is that the normal capacity of New York City hotels is about 200,000, compared with the daily figure of 160,000 hotel guests foreseen for the summer. Generally the fair's visitors carry more cameras than New Yorkers. They are, according to hotel clerks, more polite than the usual run of guests. One clerk noted that summer tourists and fair visitors tend to get up earlier than other guests, They are not inclined to sleep past breakfast, he said, and even if they were, their children do not permit such a luxury. There is no sure mark of the tourist in New York. “You've got to remember,” a shill for sightseeing tours said, “that a lot of New Yorkers look like they've never been to New York, too.” Records at the World's Fair housing bureau on the first 5,000 people that it registered this year show that the average family spends four nights and five days in New York. There were divergent views on the effect of the fair on Manhattan restaurants. Some restaurateurs feel business has slipped slightly because the fair is pulling people away from the city. But at Restaurant Associates, which operates 20 restaurants, a spokesman said that the fair was producing a boom and that business was better than ever. At the Automobile Club of New York an official said that visitors here traditionally are bothered not only by the cost of parking in the city—which often has no parallel in their home towns—but also by the fact that even all‐day parking rates of $3 to $4 entitle the motorist to only one departure each day from the lot. For this reason, he said, the new motels on the West Side, which have parking fees inchuded in the room rate and where guests may come and go with their cars as they please, are proving unusually popular during the fair.

209-> Issues in Rail Dispute Narrowed By Mediation, Johnson Reports
WASHINGTON, April 15 —President Johnson said today that there was no settlement yet of the railroad work rules dispute but that both sides “have narrowed the area of difference on some of the issues.” Intensive mediation by five mediators will continue, Mr. Johnson said. “We should know definitely, not later than next Monday, whether the parties to this dis.pute will settle it by the process of bargaining and by responsible reason,” the President said. “The country expects that answer to be yes.” Mr. Johnson made his statement after having received a report from his panel of mediators of the status of the negotiations and after having met jointly and separately with officials of the railroads and the five operating unions. The President got the unions and the railroads to agree last Thursday, less than two hours before a scheduled national railroad strike, to postpone a showdown in the five‐year‐old dispute until midnight Friday, April 24. In his private meetings with them today, he again urged that they settle their differences through collective bargaining. To do this, the President is said to have told the negotiators, management is probably going to have to give a little more than it wants to give and labor to take a little less than it wants to have. But this course, he is said to have indicated, is preferable to having the collective bargaining systen fail. In his public statement, the President declared: “The principal question is whether these bargainers can, in 15 days, get over four years of the idea of somebody else settling their disagreements for them. I hope they can. I think they can.” The strike‐delaying procedures of the Railway Labor Act have long since been exhausted in the work rules dispute. If negotiations do not produce a settlement and a walkout is scheduled, Mr. Johnson could ask Congress for new legislation to head it off. Congress has acted once before to block a national strike. On Aug. 28, 1963, it barred a strike until Feb. 25 and referred the two main issues to an arbitration board. The board ruled in November that 90 per cent of the jobs of railroad firemen in freight and yard service could be gradually eliminated. It sent the dispute over the makeup of train crews back to the individual carriers for negotiation and arbitration. The unions are challenging the ruling in court. With the main issues out of the way, the theory was that the other issues would be simple to resolve. This has not been true. These issues involve revision of the pay structure, the length of some train runs before changing crews, a demand by the railroads for greater power to assign road crews to yard work, overtime, paid holidays, premium pay, work and wage guarantees and other items. High Administration sources feel that real progress is being made in the present negotiations. Offers and counteroffers are being traded, and an effort is being made to pin down the cost of possible terms of settlement. This is an improvement over the atmosphere of previous talks and leads Administration sources to the belief that a settlement will be reached But this optimism is not shared by sources on the two sides. Although both concede an agreement is possible, they indicate that the facts and the history of the dispute point to the conclusion that one will not be reached voluntarily. The mediators working on the dispute at the President's personal request are Prof. George W. Taylor of the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce, University of Pennsylvania, and Theodore W. Kheel, New York mediator and lawyer. In addition, the mediation panel includes Labor Secretary W. Willard Wirtz, Assistant Labor Secretary James J. Reynolds and Francis A. O'Neill Jr., chairman of the National Mediation Board. The unions, which represent 200,000 workers, are the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, Brotherhood of Locomtive Firemen and Enginemen, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen and Switchmen's Union of North America.

212-> Schools in Atlanta Adopt a Speed‐Up In Integration Plan
ATLANTA, April 13 (AP) The Atlanta school system today announced plans for stepped‐up integration in the high schools. Integration now is in effect from the ninth through the 12th grades under a grade‐a‐year plan. About 150 Negro children out of 12,000 now attend desegregated schools. For the fall term, all Negroes now at the seventh‐grade level will indicate the schools they wish to enter, with the expectation that race will not figure in their placement. The system will abandcn a requirement that Negroes in grades 9 through 12 make special application for transfer to predominantly white schools. Negroes no longer will be required to take scholastic or psychological tests to determine if they will be granted transfers. Negroes have asked the Supreme Court to throw out the grade‐a‐year plan and order full desegregation bythe fall of 1965. The system announced today is built around data that A. C. Latimer, the school board at‐ torney, will present Wednesday to the high court. During the arguments before the court last month, Chief Justice Earl Warren commented on statements that some white high schools in Atlanta had empty seats while some Negro schools were overcrowded. “Still you have vacant space,” the Chief Justice told Mr. Latimer, “lots of it just because you still segregate your school system—10 years after the Brown decision [the 1954 school desegregation decision.]”

217-> NEW SAIGON PLAN TO SPUR WAR WINS INCREASED U.S. AID; Program for Additional Help Disclosed by White House —Setbacks Conceded; CAMPAIGN IS OUTLINED; Population to Be Mobilized in Drive by Gen. Khanh to Clear and Hold’Areas
WASHINGTON, March 17—The White House announced plans today to back a new South Vietnamese program for combatting the Vietcong with additional military and economic assistance. An unusual White House statement following a meeting of the National Security Council, at which President Johnson presided, conceded that Ihere had been “setbacks” in the protracted war against the Communist guerrillas. But it declared that “the situation can be significantly improved in the coming months.” Maj. Gen. Nguyen Khanh and his seven‐week‐old Government in Saigon “have produced a sound central plan for the prosecution of the war,” the White House said. It declared that Saigon recognized “to a far greater degree than before the crucial role of economic and social, as well as military, action to insure that areas cleared of the Vietcongsurvive and prosper in freedom.” The Main Provisions The White House disclosed these main provisions of the Khanh plan: 𝑞National mobilization of all able‐bodied persons to augment antiguerrilla fighters and to provide administrators, health workers, teachers and others who must follow up in areas cleared of the Vietcong. 𝑞lncreases in pay and status of the paramilitary forces, such as the Civil Guard, and intensified training of guerrilla fighters to “beat the Vietcong on its own ground.” 𝑞“Limited but significant additional equipment” for South Vietnamese air units, river navy and mobile ground units of the armed forces. “In short,” the statement declared, “where the South Vietnamese Government now has the power to clear any part of its territory, General Khanh's new program is designed to clear and to hold, step by step and province by province.” The plan will be costly to the South Vietnamese economy, which “depends heavily on United States economic aid,” the White House statement observed. “It will remain the policy of the United States to furnish assistance and support to South Vietnam for as long as it is required to bring Communist aggression and terrorism under control,” the statement added. The National Security Council customarily meets in secret. It is made up of the President, the Secretaries of. State and Defense, and the Director of the Office of Emergency Planning. Other high‐ranking Government officials, such as the Director of Central Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are regularly invited to its meetings. The subjects discussed at the council's meetings are rarely made known and statements about its “decisions” are almost never issued. In fact, the coun cil is not empowered to make decisions, but only to advise the President. It was made known today that Defense Secretary Robert S. MeNamara and Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would report on the five‐day inspection trip they and other high officials made to South Vietnam last week. The fact‐finding delegation returned last Friday and reported orally to the President. Today, the White House announcement said, they reported fully. Other members of the President's delegation to South Vietnam were John A. MeCone, who heads the Central Intelligence Agency; David A. Bell, administrator of the Agency for International Development, and William P. Bundy, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs. The White House statement repeated a charge made earlier by Secretary McNamara that the Communist North Vietnamese Government has been supplying arms and leadership to the Vietcong. But the statement made no reference to reports that General Khanh, with the tacit consent of the United States, was planning to conduct commando raids against the North Vietnamese. Hints of such retaliatory tactics were put out by Government sources here a. few weeks ago, but recently they have been played down. Authoritative sources said privately that such raids in the North were not favored by Mr. McNamaia, although he has not opposvd them in principle. The pending offensive against the Vietcong will be in South Vietnam, it is emphasized. The additional cost to the United States of the increased economic and military assistance to the Khanh regime was not indicated. Since 1954 the United States has provided nearly $3 billion in such assistance to South Vienam. The statement did not repeat one made last September, also following a report by Secretary McNamara. At that time it was announced that “the major part” of the United States military task “could be completed” by the end of 1965 and most United States military personnel, brought home. There were 16,500 American soldiers in South Vienam then and 1,000 were brought home late last year.

218-> Farm Subsidy Bill Signed by President
WASHINGTON, April 11—President Johnson signed today a farm bill providing major changes in Federal wheat and cotton subsidies. The legislation “gives us some insurance against a depression on the farm,” the President said, adding: “It is on the farms of America where depressions begin. We are dealing with a depression before it begins and not afterwards.” The cotton‐wheat measure authorizes, for the first time, a Federal subsidy to textile mills to enable them to compete with foreign mills and passes to wheat processors a part of the cost for supporting wheat prices. It should result, the Adminis‐ tration's farm experts contend, in a reduction for consumers in, the prices of sheets, shirts and other cotton goods. There should be no increase in the price of, bread and other wheat products despite opponents' contention that the bill imposes a“bread tax,” because the price of wheat will be the same as before the, bill, they said. The new law will provide about $1 billion in payments to cotton and wheat farmers, but this amount will be about $218 million less than the programs it replaces, Department of Agriculture officials said. Further, they say the savings will be greater in future years when the surplus stocks of cotton and wheat are reduced to necessary reserve size. President Johnson signed the that cleared the House early Thursday morning after a bitter partisan fight. The signing ceremony in the White House Cabinet Room was witnessed by Democratic Congressional leaders, some farm organizations and organized labor representatives, including George Meany, President of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. The signing brought the first major change in the wheat program format since it was first conceived during the first Administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The new cotton program is a triple‐subsidy plan, aiding textile mills as well as cotton farmers and exporters. President Johnson, who helped marshal House votes in a telephone attack, described the legislation as full of “common sense and valid hope.” It will help, he asserted, “avert the conditions that bring on de‐ pressions” in the country's wheat areas and will “firm up the competitive position of cot He emphasized that it was a “voluntary, repeat voluntary” measure in obvious rebuttal to Republicans who contended it was anything but that because it required millers and other wheat processors to pay a part of the cost of supporting wheat prices. Farmers, however, do not have to participate unless they wish, although they will be ineligible for price supports and other aids unless they do. The Department of Agriculture immediately announced operational details of the plan. A big surprise was that the government would begin paying to textile mills a 6½ cents a pound subsidy from now until Aug. 1 on raw cotton used. Between now and Aug. 1, the department will conduct a series of hearings in Southern cotton areas to determine the recipients of thesubsidy—whether it should go to the handlers or brokers of cotton or to the mills and other end‐users of raw cotton. Aug. 1 is the start of the new marketing year for cotton. There was no immediate estimate on how much the mill subsidy would amount to on cotton between now and Aug. 1. The legislation does not specify the recipients of the subsidy. It says only that it shall go to “persons other than producers. ’ The aim of the subsidy is to enable textile mills to buy cotton at the same price enjoyed by foreign mills under a subsidy paid to exporters. This price now is about 24 cents a pound. The exporters get a subsidy of 83½ cents a pound, the difference between 24 cents and the current Federal support price of 32.5 cents a pound for producers. The interim 6½ cents a pound subsidy will give domestic mills a price of 26.5 cents a pound until Aug. 1. At that time, the legislation provides, the Federal support price will drop to 30 cents a pound. This will enable domestic mills to buy cotton at about 23.5 cents a pound if the interim subsidy rate is retained. Agriculture officialswould say only that the paymentafter Aug. 1 would be the difference between the 30 cents a pound support price and the world price of cotton. Farmers who comply with their Federal acreage allotments will be eligible for price supports. If they reduce plantings by one‐third below their effective allotments they can earn 3.5 cents a pound, extra, or S17.50 for a 500‐pound bale. They also may plant extra acres for export when this additional acreage does not interfere with reducing the national surplus by at least 1 million bales a year. Their export acreage production must be sold at world prices. The new wheat certificate program will become effective July 1. After that date, processors and exporters will be required to buy cetificates for every bushel of wheat they use. This means that the winter wheat crop soon to be harvested will come under the new plan. Wheat growers must participate in the program to be eligi ble for Federal aid. The aid is the same as they would have received under the mandatory program they rejected last year.

220-> PRINCIPALS ASSAIL JUVENILE AGENCY; 26 on Lower East Side Say Mobilization for Youth Spurs School Agitation; INVESTIGATION IS URGED; Organization's Head Denies Charge — Declares Staff Backs ‘Lawful Activities’
An investigation of Mobilization for Youth and the removalat of one of its directors has been asked by 26 public school principals on Manhattan's Lower East Side. The agency, which was formed to combat juvenile delinquency, was accused of having encouraged extremist groups to “war against individual schools and their leaders.”' The agency's program is supported by the Ford Foundation, the National Institute of Mental Health, the President's Committee on Delinquency and Youth Crime and the city government. The principals asked for ar investigation by the sponsorand by Dr. Calvin E. Gross Superintendent of Schools, and James B. Donovan, president o the Board of Education. The principals also urged th e removal of George A. Brages director of Mobilization fo Youth's action programs. The charged that it was his faul that workers in the fields o parent education and community organization were becom ing “full‐time paid agitators and organizers for extremist eroups.” The principals alleged that these workers, who are paid by the agency, become troublemakers who spread dissension among parents and educators. “This constitutes an abuse of the noble purpose for which great sums of federal and municipal money were originally appropriated,” the principals said. The principals contend that they and their teachers are constantly harassed by demands made upon them by splinter groups and other organizations that do not represent the majority of the parents in their schools. The complaints of these groups range from alleged discrimination to lack of textbooks. Many of the complaints. the principals said, come from parents newly arrived in the city, who have been hastily formed into civic groups. Mr. Brager denied the allegations categorically and said he would rest his case on a statement issued in his behalf by Winslow Carlton, chairman of the board of Mobilization for Youth. Mr. Carlton said an impartial investigation would be welcomed “as we have complete confidence in Mr. Brager.” “Mobilization for Youth has a staff whose job is to work with and assist independent self‐directed groups of low‐income residents on the Lower East Side where Mobilization operates,” he said. “These are groups who know their own minds, who are aware that they and their children have serious problems in education, housing, employment and discrimination generally. Mobilization gives them the staff work they need to voice their concerns effectively.”

226-> Intention Asserted at Parley
THE HAGUE, Tuesday, May 12 — The United States, Britain, France and West Germany reasserted early today their intention of achieving Germany's unity, in freedom and on a basis of self‐determination for East Germany. The foreign ministers of the four powers met at dinner last night to discuss a new West German plan for reunification. This had been brought up by the German Foreign Minister, Gerhard Schröder, who had been empowered by his Government to urge new steps toward reunification. The officials are attending the Ministerial Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which opens today. At the close of the dinner, an official statement was issued on behalf of Dr. Schröder, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, the British Foreign Secretary, R. A. Butler, and the French Foreign Minister, Maurice Couve de Murville. The statement said that the foreign ministers had met to discuss Germany and had “reaffirmed their conviction that a just and peaceful solution to the problem of Germany will have to be found on the basis of the right of self‐determination.” The reference to self‐determination, diplomatic sources said, reflected the countries' insistence that any future German negotiations reflect the views of the people of Communist‐dominated East Germany. The four ministers, the statement continued, “agreed that every suitable opportunity should he seized to bring the German people's wishes for reunification in freedom nearer to reality.” United States and British officials here denied reports that their governments had endorsed a meeting between Chancellor Erhard and Premier Khrushchev. As far as United States spokesmen knew, the matter has never been raised. Maneuvering in the German delegation, however, indicates that Bonn is hoping for support for a possible ErhardKhrushchev meeting in the future. The German Chancellor mentioned the possibility in a news conference in Brussels on April 24. Since then prospects apparently have improved. For example, Vienna has been suggested as a site. It is evident in the conversation of German diplomats that they believe a new emphasis on their Government's toughness is required by the ambivalence of German policy. On one hand West Germany is expanding its already large trade with the Soviet Union and East European countries. On the other, West Germany refuses to recognize East Germany or any government that does. The ministerial conference already faces a series of critical divisive issues. Qualified sources predicted that at the first restricted session, Paul‐Henri Spaak of Belgium would demand that Maurice Couve de Murville explain France's intention toward NATO. French officials seem to be prepared to answer with diplomatic aplomb. After all, they pointed out, Dr. Dirk U. Stik ker, retiring Secretary General of NATO, also criticizes its organizations. Secretary of State Dean Rusk talked today with Stavros Costopoulos and Feridun Cemal Erkin, the Greek and Turkish Foreign Ministers. As a consequence, American sources said, the Secretary of State is moderately hopeful that a solution can be found for the Cyprus problem. But there is still no definitive settlement in sight. The best that can be said from the American standpoint is that there is at least a will in Athens and Ankara to find a solution.

229-> HITCHCOCK'S SHOW Is> MOVING TO N.B.C.; Producer's Program Is Third to Shift From C.B.S.
Alfred Hitchcock, whose television future had been in doubt, will continue being genially ghoulish next season on a different network. His show has been bought by the National Broadcasting Company, which will schedule it on Mondays, from 10 to 11 P.M. It was learned yesterday that N.B.C. completed the deal after the Columbia Broadcasting System failed to renew the show.

Mr. Hitchcock is the third television personality scheduled to switch from C.B.S. to N.B.C. next season. The others are Jack Benny and Danny Thomas. Until now N.B.C. had planned to present “The Eleventh Hour” on Mondays at 10 P.M. next season. But the series in which Ralph Bellamy plays a psychiatrist, now televised on Wednesdays, is expected to be dropped from the N.B.C. schedule after this season. The American Broadcasting Company has leased 30 motion pictures feature films produced between 1958 and 1962 for televising next season on Sundays from 9 to 11 P.M. At least one film in the package, “Some Like It Hot,” starring Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, is now showing in several theaters here. “The Misfits,” the last movie made by both Miss Monroe and Clark Gable, also is in the package. The films were leased from United Artists Television. It is understood that A.B.C. has the right, to repeat 22, thus giving it 52 weeks of programing Other films on the list and their casts include “Exodus” (Paul Newman, Eva Marie Saint and Lee J. Cobb), a fourhour film that will be presented in two parts; “The Facts of Life” (Lucille Ball and Bob Hope); “Road to Hong Kong” (Mr. Hope and Bing Crosby); “Bird Man of Alcatraz” (Burt Lancaster); “The Miracle Worker” (Patty Duke), and “The Vikings” (Kirk Douglas and Mr. Curtis).

B. S. formally announced yesterday that Fred W. Friendly had been named president of C. B. S. News. Richard S. Salant, who had held the job for three years, was appointed special assistant to Dr. Frank Stanton, president of Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. Dr. Stanton said that in the newly created post, Mr. Salant would act as chairman of the C. B. S. News executive committee and serve as liaison between management and the operating divisions in matters relating to corporate policy. In a memorandum to the news division‚ Mr. Salant, whose professional background is law, said: “As I leave C. B. S. News I want to thank you with all my heart for three wonderful years with you professionals. You kept an amateur afloat for three years—and proudly.” Mr. Friendly, who has been executive producer of “C. B. S. Reports” and other television programs, addressed members of the C. B. S. News staff yesterday afternoon and said he planned no personnel changes. “I expect all to do better,” he said. “I expect to do better.” Mr. Friendly said he would not always be popular and also would not seek popularity. He asserted that journalism does not do enough investigating, that it should disclose more and “teach the country to itch a little more.”

230-> Artists' Anger at Segregation of Southern Audiences Rising
WASHINGTON, March 4 —Opposition by concert artists to playing before segregated audiences in the South is spreading. At least two well‐known artists have asked their managements to omit from future tours communities that insist on segregation. Other artists have indicated that they are preparing to do the same. A spokesman for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People reported today an “enthusiastic response” to informal inquiries among musicians on the prospects of organizing boycott's against segregated audiences. Until now, many prominent concert artists had either limited their engagements in the South, or had accepted engagements there in the hope that they could contribute to more enlightened attitudes through their art and by discussing racial issues with civic Ieaders. The feeling now, however, appears to be that the artistic community must assume a more explicit and active participation in the drive to promote equal treatment of Negroes. Artists in the entertainment field have long ago begun organized action against segregation. Jaime Laredo, the violinist, a winner of the Queen Elisabeth of Belgium competition, disclosed last night that he had included an antisegregation clause in his new contract with Columbia Artists management. He said the management had raised no objection. Although he is a Bolivian national, the 23‐year‐old violinist said that on an issue affecting the fundamental rights of man “nobody can take refuge behind nationality or any special privileges he may feel are due to him as an artist.” Mr. Laredo received his training at the Curtis Institute of Music. He believes that he owes the United States much for the early success of his career. He is married to an American the pianist Ruth Meckler, and has made his home in New York. Dr. John Morsell, assistant executive secretary of the N.A.A.C.P., said that he planned to send out a circular next week to outstanding performers in an effort to begin an organized drive in support of integration. The inspiration, he said came from Gary Graffman, a New York pianist, who last week turned down an engagement in Jackson, Miss., at the request of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He has since advised his manager, Columbia Artists, not to book him for any more concerts before segregated audiences. After considerable difficulty in finding a substitute, Columbia Artists filled the engagement with the German pianist Hans Richter Haaser, who said that he did not wish to become involved in “internal problems” of this country. There is no relation between the race issue and music, he contended. John Lewis, chairman of the student committee, has appealed to the Swedish soprano Birggit Nilsson to cancel an appearance in Jackson in May. She is to appear under the auspices of Community Concerts, Inc., which is controlled by the Columbia Artists management. Leon Fleisher, the pianist, said tonight that he had also asked Columbia Artists not to book him for any concerts from which Negroes would be barred. “I am not going to play for segregated audiences and my management has promised to abide by my decision,” he said. He said he had turned down an engagement in Charleston, S. C., for next season after he had been notified that it was a segregated community. Mr. Fleisher's wife, Rachael, has been active in the integration movement in Baltimore, where they live.

232-> A.T.&T. Offers New Stock at Bargain Price; Stockholders Given Rights to Purchase Shares for $100
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company set $100 a share yesterday as the bargain price each of its 2.25 million stockholders will have to pay to buy one new share of its stock. Those who do not own shares have one week—until the close of business Feb. 18—to buy A. T. & T. shares in order to become eligible for the rights offering, which is expected to provide the company with a record of more than $1.2 billion for 1964 expansion projects. This will be the largest amount of money ever raised by any company in any type of financing venture. Not all A. T. & T. stockholders will be eligible to buy new shares at the bargain rate. They must own 20 shares on Feb. 18 to get the 20 rights that entitle them to a new share at $100. The stock closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange of 146, a gain of 17/8 on a turnover of 53,000 shares. But even the individual rights have cash value for those who do not have the necessary 20 shares to qualify to buy one share at the reduced rate. Based n yesterday's closing of 146, the single right should bear a value of at least 21/4 and should probably trade higher between now and the expiration date of April 6. The size of the undertaking is staggering even for the world's largest corporate enterprise. The sum of money to be raised will be put into the company's 1964 expansion program of $3.25 billion, another world's record. The mechanics of the move border on the fantastic. The company has taken a temporary lease on the vacant 20‐story Sperry Rand building at 315 Park Avenue South near 24th Street. This will serve as the headquarters for a temporary work force of about 2,500 workers who will handle the necessary correspondence. The group will include regular A.T&T. employes, plus about 200 skilled emploes recruited from Bell System units from as far away as CaIifornia. A counter will be set up in the lobby of the company's headquarters at 195 Broadway near Fulton Street to handle in‐person callers, while the regular stock and bond division headquarters at 50 Varick Street will be the site of more technical activity. Between 200 and 300 of the temporary employes have been notified by mail to report on Feb. 19 to begin three days of schooling. The bulk of the clerks will report on Feb. 24 to begin the actual work attendant to the offering. That week mail filling an esti mated 3,200 bags and weighing 160 tons will be sent out to the world's largest stockholder family. Each envelope will contain a prospectus and an announcement letter that explains to stockholders how they may use their rights to purchase the additional shares. On March 2, just after the initial mailing is completed, another containing the warrants will go out to the same stockholders. This mailing will weigh about 52 tons and will fill 1,500 mail sacks. Then there will be a brief rest until replies start coming in from the stockholders. Each reply must be checked for proper entries in the necessary places, signatures and stamps. Company spokesmen warned yesterday that stockholders must not staple, fold, crease or otherwise rough up the warrants since automatic business machines will be rquired to process the forms within the allotted time. The offering expires on April 6, but many of the temporary work force will remain to complete the rights offering. Aside from the mechanical problems that arise in such an undertaking. A. T. & T. executives have become accustomed to an almost limitless period of queries, mixups and complaints. The hard core of these problems will be handled by regular employes and by the special trainees, but all have been cautioned to be polite and take every query as vital to each shareholder. A basic problem that always arises is what happens to the person who does not own 20 shares. The company has always tried to get across to the shareholders that each “right” has a cash value. The New York Stock Exchange announced late yesterday that such rights will be admitted to “when issued” trading today and to regular dealings on March 3, the day after the actual mailing of the warrants. The price of the rights varies with the actual demand. No one can tell at present just what the cash value of each will be, but if past experience is worth an ything. then the shareholders have every reason to expect that about $2.25 each would be the minimum. The 1961 offering, also on a 1‐for‐20 basis, varied from a low of 1 3/16 to a high of 2 9/32. The offering price was set at $86 a share at a time when A. T. & T. stock was trading in the range of 120 to 130 a share. That rights offering provided the giant utility with $961,175,302, the previous record in any financing. Directors also declared a regular dividend at a new rate of $1 a share payable April 1 to stockholders of record Feb. 28. The old rate had been 90 cents a share. At the annual meeting on April 15, stockholders will be asked to approve a previously proposed two‐for‐one stock split. Market observers noted yesterday that some discounting had already set in as the stock rose to 146. The reasoning goes like this: If a person owns 100 shares of “T”—the ticker symbol for A. T. & T.—he will have 100 rights, which would entitle him to purchase five new shares at $100 each instead of at yesterday's price of 146. This would cost him $500 instead of the $730 (5 times $146) he would have to pay on the open market. The weeks ahead will tell the actual story of this gigantic financing. The last rights offering in 1961 was 99.9 per cent subscribed. A. T. & T. officials are hoping at least to match that level again, but there are always those few who do not choose to profit from such an offer.

First‐quarter net income of the C.I.T. Financial Corporation rose to $10,949,000, or 57 cents a share, from $10,884,000, or 56 cents a share in the 1963 quarter. Because of a typographical error, March‐quarter earnings were incorrectly reported in some editions of yesterday's Times.

234-> CLOTHIERS PLACE ACCENT ON YOUTH; Men's Wear Retaifers See Boom in Teen‐Age Trade
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 11—The accent was on youth here today among the 4,000 retailers attending the convention of the National Association of Retail Clothiers and Furnishers. Wherever the men's wear retailers thronged—in lobbies of the Biltmore Hotel, in manufacturers' showrooms and in meeting rooms—the burgeoning, affluent young man's market and better ways to reach, it were among the leading topics of conversation. The reason for such interest becomes obvious in an analysis of Commerce Department population figures. Males in the teenage (15 to 19) and college‐age (20 to 24) categories, who numbered 24,561,000 in 1960, are expected to exceed 36 million in six years. In addition, this group has a substantial amount of cash to spend. men's wear merchants maintain. Floyd D. Stein, operator of Mr. Floyd's in La Grange, Ill., said, “You never came upon such a market where money means nothing.” According to Mr. Stein, young men “are taking the money for their clothing out of their fathers' clothing budgets.” Credit Rating Cited Robert R. Storrer of Storrer's in Owosso, Mich., noted that the, teen‐ager “has a very good credit rating. In a lot of cases, they're much better than their fathers.” However, ir. Storrer said at a panel discission today that charge accounts for customers under 25 years of age had to be co‐signed by their parents. But he added that sales to this group had been “very very profitable.” This youth market is “sustaining a lot of stores today,” Edward E. Livingston of Livingston's Big. Duluth of Duluth, Minn., said. “It's the new boom and this explosion is going to carry on for quite a number of years.” To attract the youth group without alienating his older customers, Philip Brandmeier of McFarlin in Rochester, N. Y., has two separate shops in his store. A university shop for the 15‐to‐25 age bracket sells suits priced from $45 to $69, while a traditional shop caters to older men with suits selling for $75 and above. Joseph N. Neel Jr., of the Joseph N. Neel Company in Macon, Ga., believes that young men's departments are “in direct competition with other male departments within the same store.” To sell to the youth market, he said, “some fads you cater to, others you try to create.” What kind of clothing do the teen‐agers wear? Representatives of the American Institute Men's and Boys' Wear said today at the group's fashion press preview that the teenager was inconsistent in his tastes but was seeking exciting fashions. Robert Jacobs of Louis Goldsmith, Inc., a manufacturer of tailored clothing, reported that young men preferred suits with slim‐looking trousers and shorter jackets with natural shoulders. They present a lucrative market, Mr. Jacobs said. “They've got a buck where their older counterparts who are married haven't.” The name selected for merchandise designed for the youth market is extremely important. said Martin Miller, vice president of the Miller Bros. Hat Company, Inc. Before choosing the name Contact for its line of slacks when it entered the field Miller Bros. made a careful study of appealing names, he said. “You have to pick a name that's conservative enough for the retailers but distinctive enough for the teen‐agers,” he said. The Men's Wear Institute, which is holding its fashion preview in conjunction with the Retailers' Convention, said that teen‐agers were big purchasers of knit shirts, sweatshirts that look like sweaters and ski parkas. Light colors and white are the favorites with this group, institute spokesmen noted.

235-> ATOM PLANT SITE ON L. I. SELECTED Moriches Bay Project Would Generate Electric Power and Desalinate Water; UTILITIES ARE SKEPTICAL; Light Company and Water Authority Say Production Costs Would Be High
MASTIC BEACH, L. I., Feb. 25—Forge Point on Moriches Bay has been recommended as the site for a nuclear‐powered electric generating and saltwater purification plant. The proposal was announced today by the State Atomic Research and Development Authority. The announcement was received with enthusiasm by local Government officials, but key outlets for the plant's power and water voiced strong doubts about its economic feasibility. The Long Island Lighting Company, noting that it had extensive investments in two experimental nuclear‐powered generating projects elsewehere, said it was not interested in an experimental plant on Long Island. The company is building a $48 million conventional plant at Northport. The Suffolk County Water Authority said it would be willing to buy the plant's water only if the cost was competitive with that of its own well production. A spokesman for the authority said it would cost $800 to produce a million gallons of fresh water from the plant, compared to $100 a million for water from wells. Tentative plans call for a plant capable of producing 360 million kilowatts and several million gallons of water a day. State Senator Elisha T. Barrett of Brightwaters said today that the recommendation had been submitted to the Atomic Research and Development Authority by Burns & Roe, Inc., Hempstead engineering consultant. after a two‐year survey. The site is on 611 acres of salt marsh and uplands at the mouth of the Forge River about three miles east of the Smith Point Bridge. “Congress already has appropriated $30 million to assist in bringing the project into existence,” Senator Barrett said. However, he pointed out, the program “hinges upon the possibility of an agreement with the Long Island Lighting Company for the use of the electric power.”

237-> SCHOOL FISCAL CUT DECRIED BY BOARD; Peril to Improvement Plans Seen in Mayor's Slash
The Board of Education warned yesterday that any major cut in its budget would jeopardize the school improvement program. Reduction of the school budget by some $45 million, proposed by Mayor Wagner, would result in elimination of a number of “extremely critical” programs and prevent the introduction of new programs whose need is dictated by the “steadily shifting social patterns” within the city, the board said. Budget hearings will be held on May 7 by the Board of Estimate and the City Council on the School budget. Final action on the budget will follow the hearings. In the meantime, a revision of the budget to meet the Mayor's reduction has been prepared by the board. It calls for the abandonment of plans to reduce class size, of increased spending for textbooks and supplies, repair and maintenance and guidance services, of further strengthening the junior high schools and of expanding after‐school and summer recreation programs. Salary increases stemming from collective bargaining agreements, the cost of continuing present programs for larger numbers of students and other mandated costs will leave less than $2.4 million for the introduction of new programs or for the expansion of present programs and services if the Mayor's reduction is approved, the board said. After giving “serious consideration” to the various aspects of the educational program, the board has recommended that that sum “be used essentially for the improvement of its integration and quality education program and for direct services to the children in. the schools.” Among the new programs that the board wished to introduce, are the following: ¶An expanded kindergarten program that would not only accommodate every child who applies but seek to bring all eligible children into the schools. ¶A new pre‐kindergarten program to help the schools compensate for “inadequacies created by various social dislocations.” ¶Summer elementary schools that would specialize in improving basic skills. ¶A college discovery program to upgrade the aspirations and accomplishments of potentially able students from lower economic groups. ¶An expanded program to help give out‐of‐school youth and adults the basic educational and vocational skills to enable them to find employment. The board explained its financial position in a notice of a special meeting to be held at 3 P.M. next Tuesday at110 Livingston Street, Brooklyn, to act on the allocation of its lump appropriation from the city's expense budget. According to board figures, the schools received $66.3 million over and above present budgetary allowances. Of this amount pension contributions account for $10.4 million and subsidies for low‐fare rates on public transportation come to $3.1 million. Salary adjustments total $22 million and the costs of carrying forward present programs with increased student enrollments came to $28.2 million. A lump sum of $2 million is included in the budget to carry out the board's integration plan, the details of which have not yet been announced. The only decrease in existing services indicated in the board's revised budget is a reduction of 60 teaching positions in the academic high schools, based on an estimated enrollment drop of 2,000 pupils. Among the items for which provision was asked by the board but were not included in the revised allocations are: reduction of class size, $3.5 million; educational supplies, textbooks and equipment, $4.2 million; repairs and maintenance, $5 million, guidance counselors, $1.8 million, and additional positions for junior high schools, $984,000.

238-> EL GREGO RULING IS DUE ON MONDAY; Spanish Aides Here 'Hopeful' That Fair Will Get Art
Spanish authorities at the World's Fair said yesterday that they had been informed that the final decision in whether to send El Greco's “Burial of the Count of Orgaz” to the fair would be announced in Spain on Monday. Plans to send the painting here have aroused controversy in Spain. The Spanish aides here said they were stiIl “most hopeful” that the masterpiece would be here for the Spanish exhibit. The loan of the painting has already been approved by the Spanish Council of Ministers, Spain's highest governing body. Only a ruling by Generalissimo Francisco Franco could reverse this decision. If the painting is not sent, the authorities said, it will be because technical experts feel that the canvas is too fragile to withstand shipment. They added that the experts in Spain were arguing‐ on both sides of the issue and that a decision would be made after all views were heard. The start of constrtuction of a special building to house the El Greco has been postponed pending the decision. Tracing the development of the controversy, authorities at the fair said that they had first heard that the painting was removed from the wall of the Church in San Tomé in Toledo, Spain, on Friday to prepare it for shipment. The painting was then placed in a special container. When the controversy over the proposed shipment arose; the painting was screwed back onto a temporary frame in the church. It can be removed from this frame and once more prepared for shipment without difficulty.

243-> STOCK PRICES SOAR TO RECORD LEVELS; Upturn Propels the Mark Averages to New Highs —Trading Is Heavy; R.C.A. TOPS ACTIVE LIST; Steel and Auto Issues Lead Ascent Fueled by bright Outlook for Business
Prices on the New York Stock Exchange advanced yesterday with the key market averages again reaching record levels The upturn was led by steel auto, office‐equipment, machinetool, savings‐and‐loan and spa cial‐situation issues. Some profit taking was evident in many of the issues that have shown large gains recently. The volume of trading was the heaviest since mid‐January, with sales amounting to 6.18 million shares, compared with 5.5 million on Tuesday. Opening prices showed slight gains, with the volume amounting to 1.76 million shares in the first hour of trading against 1.5 million in the first hour on Tuesday. American Telephone, which had been under mild pressure for several days, opened with a 2‐point gain, at 141, on a block of 7,200 shares. This gave traders a measure of confidence and various groups took turns in leading the market advance. By noon, the upward trend was halted briefly as some profit taking appeared. In the early afternoon, the steels and motors assumed prominence and most other groups followed in the last 30'minutes of trading. prices shaded a bit in heavy trading. Economic developments in the news continued to be en couraging. Secretary of Commerce Luther Hodges expressed the be lief that business will become increasingly brisk this year. He said that manufacturers expected their sales this year to expand by 6 per cent following a rise of 4 per cent in 1963, also expressed confidence ?? economy would not expand so fast that it would stumble into a recession or bring on inf1ation. Despite the prevailing optimism on the stability of the economy, a question has beer raised as to what extent this has been discounted in the rise in the last three and ahalf months in stock prices. Of course, there is a large proportion of stocks that have not participated to a great ex tent in the rise and this has led to the argument that the market still has not yet topped out. One observer noted, however, that a break in a few relatively overpriced issues conceivably could turn what should have been a localized correction into a broad decline. The leading market averages reached intraday and closing records yesterday, although closing prices were below their highs for the session. The Dow‐Jones industrial average touched a historic intraday high of 817 and then closed at 813.87, up 4.48 for the day. At 2.30 P.M. the group stood at 814.44, up 5.05.

245-> Cloyd Peart Clevenger, 66, Early Aviation Adventurer
MEXICO CITY, Feb. 12 (AP) —Cloyd Peart Clevenger, an early aviation adventurer, died Monday. He was 66 years old. Mr. Clevenger was reputed to have been the first skywriter. He was a World War I ace and later organized commuter airlines around the Caribbean. He was operations manager of Pan American World Airway's Caribbean division. In 1938 he was jailed for a year and a day on charges of violating the United States Neutrality Act by smuggling planes for use in the Spanish Civil War. When World War II broke out, he joined Pan American again and ferried planes to Britain. He moved to Mexico permanently in 1957. He is survived by his widow, Mrs. Carmen Neri Clevenger.

247-> Jail Escape Prompts Inspection of All Cells
This may be the old story of locking the barn, but the police moved yesterday to see if any detention cells in police stations had defects that might enable prisoners to escape. The action came after a prisoner escaped Sunday morning from a cell at the new 76th Precinct station‐house at 196 Union Avenue, Brooklyn, by kicking in two ceiling panels and escaping through air‐conditioning ducts. Yesterday, Deputy PoliceCommissioner Jacob S. Katz ordered an inspection of cells that were similarly construct ed. He also ordered extra heavy expanded wire mesh and plaster installed in the vulnerable sections of ceilings.

251-> Charting the Corporate Life
For the nation's railroads, an off‐beat, soft‐cover book offers an off‐line solution to the carriers' major problem. Year after year the railroads report deficits on their passenger operations, and profits, sometimes rising, on their freight business. “Behind the Annual Report,” subtitled “an alarming peek” into corporation statements, suggests “the feasibility of carrying passengers in freight cars.” With charts and tables, the book (published by Simon & Schuster at $1.95) pursues a humorous course through the ups and downs of corporate life. One chart, for example, shows exactly what happened to production when the directors authorized removal of time clocks and permitted a morning coffee break. Output plummeted 87 per cent. The text of the book was written by Wililam Chambless and the illustrations were done by Jack Haunty.

252-> COAST GUARD AID IS REMEMBERED; Sailing Man Gives a Party for Atlantic Searchers
Colin Leslie Fox, a nautical version of Thoreau whose Walden Pond is the Atlantic Ocean, which he has crossed alone twice in sail, gave a party last night for 20 Coast Guard officers and enlisted men. It was his way of saying thanks for their round‐theclock efforts during two weeks in December and January to rescue him when his 32‐foot boat, the Vaiger, was reported lost in wild Atlantic weather en route from New York to Bermuda. He was blown far off course but landed without assistance in the Bahamas. None of the Coast Guard's 20‐odd men in the Rescue Coordination Center at Bowling Green headquarters could recall “anything more than an occasional ‘thank‐you' letter after rescue efforts.” And their memory went back about 20 years. Last year the Coast Guard saved 1,900 persons and answered 37,330 calls for assistance, involving property with a total value of nearly $1 billion. Mr. Fox, a 40‐year‐old Englishman with a mustache that would hide a harmonica, was indeed grateful for the service's efforts to help him. He had sailed from New York on Dec. 5. Between Dec. 26, when an “all‐ships” search call went out after a friend reported Mr. Fox missing in his, gaff‐rigged cutter, and Jan. 10, when she tied up at Eleuthera in the Bahamas, merchant ships and Navy and Coast Guard planes and cutters searched a 350‐mile area of the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Last week Mr. Fox went down to Bowling Green and met Captain James N. Schrader and the men in his rescue command. “I simply wanted to thank them in person and invite them up for a bit of food and drink,” he remarked during the gathering in his East Side apartment last night as his guests relaxedstill rather surprised that anyone would “bother to go to all this trouble to thank us for doing our job,” as one enlisted man remarked. But Mr. Fox had a different view. He said: “There's little enough gratitude expressed these days for favors done; we're grateful but somehow we don't seem to find the time to say so, and then it's too late to ‘bother.' ” His Coast Guard guests talked with him about the sea and ships and listened with a sailor's quiet enthusiasm as he recounted his two one‐man Atlantic crossings. The first was in 1953, for 7,000 miles and 87 days from England to Florida in his 23foot Deben Peace. The second, in the Vaiger, was in 1959, from the Canary Islands to St. Croix in the Virgin Islands, a 52‐day sail, followed by an 18‐day run to New York.

254-> SPAIN IS REBUFFED BY COMMON MARKET
MADRID, Feb. 26—Spain appeared embarrassed today in efforts to explain why the European Common Market had again ignored her two‐year‐old application to join. Ministers of France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg ended a two‐day meeting in Brussels yesterday without considering Spain's case. Madrid had asked last week for "exploratory talks" to discuss what kind of links could be established between Spain and the Common Market. The request was contained in a letter to Foreign Minister Paul Henri Spaak of Belgium, current president of the Common Market's Council of Ministers. A recommendation by President de Gaulle of France preceded the formal move. Today a Foreign Ministry spokesman here said Spain's desire for association would be considered at the next ministers meeting of the group March 9. Arriba, organ of the authoritarian Falange movement, published today a Brussels dispatch quoting an aide to Foreign Minister Giuseppe Saragat of Italy as denying the Spanish case was on the agenda of the March meeting.

255-> Spain Seeks lmprisonment Of 33 in Political Trial
MADRID, Feb. 1—The trial of 33 men — including seven lawyers — charged with attempting to reorganize the banned Spanish Socialist party and the General Union of Workers continued today. The prosecutor yesterday demnanded prison sentences of six years for 11 of the defendants and four years for the 22 thers, in addition to fines of 50,000 pesetas ($883) for the former and half that much for the rest. The principal defendant is a 42‐year‐old lawyer, Antonio Amat Maiz. Described by the Prosecution as the “ringleader,”; he has conceded that Spanish Socialists exiled in France gave him the task of reorganizing both the Socialist party and the General Union of Workers. They were to be built along lines common to Socialism in other Western European countries, he said.

258-> New Hampshire Unaffected
CONCORD, N. H., Jan 17—The 24th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, outlawing the poll tax in Federal elections, will have little effect on New Hampshire. This state has had a poll tax since colonial days, but it has never been a requirement for voting. Since 1951, it has also hadl a head tax. The poll tax—$2—is assessed on a l l persons between the ages of 21 and 70. Exemptions are given to war veterans under a statute defining New Hampshire's interpretation of wartime periods. The tax is collected by the individual municipalities for their general funds. The head tax—$5—is also assessed from all persons from 21 to 70. An exemption is allowed those on active duty with the armed forces as of April 1 of each year. A number of New Hampshire residents interviewed today expressed surprise that the poll tax was not a requirement for voting. Most of them, however, were aware that both taxes had to be paid before registering a motor car or getting a fishing, hunting or trapping license. The poll tax, originally a form of income tax, was first enacted in 1784, the year the New Hampshire Constitution was adopted. It levied 10 shillings on males from 18 “and upward.” Male slaves between 16 and 45 were also assessed at 10 shillings and female slaves bet ween 16 and 45 at 5 shillings. There were separate rates for horses, oxen and cows. Free white females were not taxed unt i l later in the state's history. The $5 head tax was enacted as a temporary fiscal emergeney measure in 1951. But it has been re‐enacted by each biennial session of the Legislature since then.

259-> Spain Rounds Up 7 Basques On Charges of Subversion
MADRID, Feb. 4 — Seven members of the Basque Nationalist party have been rounded up by the Civil Guard. It is alleged that in recent months those detailed have been conspiring to disturb public order and have been circulating propaganda based on material received from France, for “subversive action” in the Basque province of Guipuzcoa. San Sebastian is the provincial capital. The subversive activities, it is alleged, also extend to the Basque province of Biscay, whose capital in Bilbao, and to the neighboring province of Navarre. Some of those held. the authorities say, were paid activists.

261-> SPACE UNIT BACKS A BOSTON CENTER; But Foes Threaten to Carry Dispute to House Floor
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24—By a divided vote the House Committee on Science and Astronautics approved today the space agency's controversial plan to build a $60 million electronics research center in the Boston area. The decision was reached at a reportedly heated meeting that found Administration supporters pressing for approval an.d opponents questioning the need for the center and its locauon inn Boston. The 18‐13 vote was reported to have cut across party lines. In the opinion of some comnmittee members, the effect may be to force into the open what they view as the “pork‐barrel” use of the space program and its lucrative contracts. Some opponents were threatening to take the issue to the House floor. The center has been embroiled in political bickering since it was proposed over a year ago by the Kennedy Administration The choice of Boston prompted charges that the project represented an Administration attempt to redeem a campaign promise by Senator Edward M. Kennedy that he could “do more” for Massachusetts. That belief was shared privately by some of Mr. Kennedy's fellow Democrats. Representative John W. Wydler, Republican of Garden City, L. I., charged after the committee meetin g that the vote was “the first memorial to the junior Senator from Massachusetts.” Political suspicions over the center were aroused by the unusual manner in which the project had been advanced. Congressional hearings brought out that the center was a lastminute addition to the space agency budget in 1962 and that Boston had been picked without the customary agency review of potential locations. As a result of protests, Congress provided last year that the space agency could not start on the center until it had submitted a report justifying the need for the laboratory and its location. This set off intensive regional competition, with 50 areas seeking to get the center. After a review by a five‐man committee, the agency reported to Congress last month that the center was needed to meet its growing research needs in electronics. As expected, the agency also reaffirmed its recommendation for Boston on the ground that the center would thus be near an industry‐university complex heavily engaged in electronics research. Under last year's legislation, the agency will be permitted to go ahead with the project unless it is vetoed by the House or Senate snace committees. Little difficulty is expected in obtaining the Senate committee's approval. However, a good part of the protest has crime from members of Congress representing areas that did not get the center. These complaints are based largely on the grounds that the center is not needed and is being pushed for political reasons.

262-> Soviet Scientist Believes ‘Snowmen’ Are Neanderthal Survivors
The “abominable snowmen,” whose appearance in Eurasian mountains has been reported but never confirmed, may represent a few surviving remnants of the Neanderthal man, according to a Soviet scientist. His hypothesis, published by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, recalls earlier reports from the Soviet Union of sightings of strange, hairy creatures that walk upright. Several years ago it was reported that the Soviet Academy had appointed a special commission to investigate such incidents. But its findings, if any, have not been made public. The latest proposal, according to press reports from Moscow, has been made by Prof. Boris Porshnev. This is presumably Dr. Boris F. Porshnev of the Historical Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, an authority on West European history and winner, in 1950, of a Stalin Prize. The Neanderthal man was short, thickset and somewhat apelike in appearance. He dominated Western Europe from about 75,000 years ago to some 25,000 years before the present. His name is taken from a narrow valley in West Germany. The first report of an abominable snowman seems to have been made by Col. Howard Bury, who led a reconnaissance of Mount Everest in 1921. His group came upon tracks in the snow that the native porters said were those of a metohkangmi, or yeti, which was translated “abominable snowman.” There have been a number of further reports of footprints or brief sightings. During World War II, according to one account, a Soviet Army doctor was summoned by the local police to examine an “enemy agent” captured naked in the snowy mountains of Daghestan. The doctor found the creature to be completely covered with coarse hair, like that of a bear, and it apparently could not speak The captive perspired so, during the indoor examination, that it was finally taken out onto the midwinter snow, where it seemed more comfortable. During the International Geophysical Year of 1957–58 a Soviet expedition was making its way up the Fedchenko Glacier, which, with its tributary glaciers is one of the largest ice masses outside the polar regions. Its icy fingers clutch at the slopes of what was then called Mount Stalin, rising to 24,590 feet. It is now Mount Communism. One of the party, a Professor Pronin of Leningrad University, reportedly saw what he took at first to be a bear emerge from a cave. However, it walked on two legs and was covered with heavy, reddish‐gray hair. After several minutes it vanished behind a rock. While Professor Pronin apparently told Western colleagues of his experience, it is not cited in official accounts available in the West. Western scientists have tended to discount such reports. They find it hard to believe that any such creatures could survive, even in remote mountain areas, without more definite evidence of their existence. In recent years many expeditions have invaded the Himalayas. Some were determined to capture a Yeti if they could and even carried air guns with drugged darts, in case of a sighting. None, however, has been captured, either in the flesh or on film.

263-> SOVIET SAID TO DOOM JEW IN FRAUD CASE
MOSCOW, Feb. 10—The leader of a fraud network in Moscow that involved bribe‐taking Soviet officials has been sentenced to death, according to reliable sources. The others in the gang, said to consist of 23 persons are still on trial and are expected to be sentenced in the next few days. Eighteen of the accused are understood to be Jews. They include the ringleader, identified as Shakerman and two others named Roifman and Galperin. The ring is said to have netted 3 million rubles ($3.3 million) by using mental patients in a rehabilitation clinic to produce knitted goods which were sold through illegal retail outlets in market places and railway stations. The Soviet Government newspaper Izvestia, in identifying some of the accused by name last fall, said: “We mention the Jewish surname … because we pay no heed to the malicious slander that is stirred up from time to time in the Western press. It is not Jews, Russians, Tatars or Ukrainians who will stand trial — criminals will stand trial.” The fact that Jews make up about half of the 160 persons sentenced to death in the last three years for economic crimes has been interpreted in some quarters abroad as evidence of anti‐semitism. This has been steadfastly denied by the Soviet authorities.

264-> CHESS: SOME ODD PATHS TO VICTORY
THE quarter of games below run the gamut for off‐beat punch. Sharp, exciting, above all, bizarre,they were played in the recently completed United States Chesff Championship at the Henry Hudson Hotel. Just before the 20‐year‐old Brooklynite, Bobby Fischer, sat down to play Pal Benko of New York in the tenth round, he had already clinched the title. The resignation by Don‐ald Byrne of their 9th‐round game without resumption of play gave Fischer a score of 9‐0, one that was mathematically beyond the reach of any other player in the 12‐man field. Most competitors in such a fortunate role might have taken it easy for the next two rounds. But relaxation is not Fischer's forte. Against Benko, he was remorseless. On the white side of a King's Fianchetto Defense, he started a king‐side attack. After Benko's 18 . . . PxB, Fischer came up with one, of the most electrifying moves in the history of American chess. His obvious move might have been 19 P‐K5, threatening mate. But this would have been met by 19 . . . P‐KB4, practically forcing the exchange of queens. Fischer blocked Black's king bishop pawn by playing 19 R‐B6. Now, whether or not Benko captures the rook or leaves it alone, he is lost. For now White's unimpeachable threat is 20 P‐K5, and it winds up in checkmate or gain of much material. Black plays it out to the bitter end. But after 21 N‐K2 he has no choice but to resign. His knight is attacked. If 21 . . . N‐any; 22 Q‐B5, etc. If 21 . . .

Black early gets in some lively pawn thrusts: 8 . . . P‐QN4, 10 . . . P‐N5 and 11 . .. P‐B4. This infantry activity in combination with White's awkwardly. placed queen presents Black with the superior tactical possibilities. And he cashes in when Bisguier dubiously attacks the black queen, 16 N‐N3. Temporarily, White wins the queen for two bishops. But his maneuver boomerangs when he winds up a piece behind. Bisguier seems only to have just begun to fight, for his 21 R‐BBch restricts three black pieces. And Black must exercise caution. After 21 .. B‐B1, the question arises: Why doesn't White play 22 N‐B6, NxN; 23 RxR? He would have a rook for two minor men. After 23 . . . B‐R3, however, threatening 24 . . . B‐N2, the rook would be in constant jeopardy. After the shrewd 28 B‐QN4, White has nothing better than to operate on hope. Had White varied on his 29th turn, e.g., 29 R‐any, B‐K2 would follow. This defeat is particularly because not once did Black move his queen knight or queen rook.

This English Opening is in reality a Sicilian Defense for White, with a move in hand. And Addison treats it as such, and attacks in the modern way, sparked by 10 . . . P‐KR4 and 11 . . . P‐R5. Although White dislodges Black's king ‐with 16 R‐Klch, Black is safe enough, and it is White who is under fire. White's saving move is 21 NB1.

265-> Soviet Report on Hitler Disputed by Historian
LONDON, Feb. 22 (AP)—Prof. Hugh Trevor‐Roper, the Oxford historian who wrote “The Last Days of Hitler,” disagreed today with Marshal Vasily I. Chuikov's version of how the Füehrer met his end. While acknowledging the Russians were first on the scene in Berlin, Professor Trevor‐Roper disputed Marshal Chuikov's report — published yesterday—that Soviet Army soldiers saw Hitler's charred body in a smoldering rug on May 2, 1945. “Not correct,” he said, adding: “I think it's a perfectly genuine misrecollection of a detail. “The man who buried Hitler is still alive. His name is Mengershausen. I have interrogated him. He buried the body in a bomb crater—probably not very scientifically—on the evening of April 30.” The Russians later had Mengershausen dig up the body to identify it, Professor Trevor‐Roper said. Mengershausen became a Russian prisoner and did not return to Germany for several years.

267-> New I.C.C. Chairman Declares Railroads Are in Sound Health; Abe McGregor Goff Weighs Prospects for the Industry at Start of His Term
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 (AP)—The new chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission took a long look at the nation's railroads today and declared the industry healthy and sound. “They'll never be obsolete—no, sir,” declared Abe McGregor Goff, the 64‐year‐old Idaho Republican who became head of the 11‐man commission Jan. 1. “The railroads have had a tremendous increase in longhaul traffic,” Mr. Goff said in an interview. “I won't make any specific predictions about the future, but all of our railroads are in much healthier shape than they were last year at this time.” If the industry is so healthy, why have so many mergers been consummated or proposed? “Why, that's simple,” Mr. Goff said. “Seventy‐five years’ ago, when all the railroads were laid out, they didn't lay them out in a pattern designed for modern conditions. They had no way of knowing what this country would look like today. So’ now there have to be some ad-, justments made.” Mr. Goff had a ready answer when asked whether he has a philosophy about railroad mergers. “Of course I do,” he said. “If they're in the public interest, I favor them. If they're bad, I'm against them.” One of the biggest merger cases the commissionhas considered in a long time is the proposal to merge the Pennsylvania and the New York Central railroads. Hearings on that proposal ended last summer after a year of arguments. Two commission examiners are sifting through more than 20,000 pages of testimony and evidence. Mr. Gogf did not predict when the final commission decision would be handed down. “That's too hard to say safely,” he said, “But I'll be surprised if the examiners have a recommendation before Labor Day.” After that, nearly two months of exceptions and replies must be filed. Then the commission probably will schedule oral arguments before the full commission. It is considered unlikely that its final decision will go into effect before one party or the other had appealed it through the courts. Thus the complicated PennsyCentral merger case may not be settled until well into 1965. The new I.C.C. chairman is a native of Washington state, but his home for years has been Moscow, Idaho. He represented that state's First District in the United States House of Representatives in 1947-48. Mr. Goff served as an Army private in World War I, and became a colonel in World War II, when he served in Africa and the Middle East. He was solicitor of the Post Office Department in 1958 when President Eisenhower appointed him to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Mr. Goff became chairman Jan. 1, succeeding Laurence K. Walrath. The chairmanship rotates among the commissioners each year.

268-> Observer; The Kissing Society and Its Manic Cars
Impressions of New York from an outsider“s notebook: Kissing is the thing among smart, people here. It is displacing the handshake as the standard form of greeting inside the establishment. At social gatherings women kiss men and women kiss women on en‐trances and farewells. It is all very Russian, although men are not yet kissing men, at least at the better parties. The technique of the New York social kiss is ritualistically casual. It would not do for a gentleman to lean into a lady and smack her hungrily on the lips, nor for a lady to do anything that would smear her lipstick on a kissing compan‐ion's collar or jewelry. In a correct kiss, the two parties approach within handshaking dis‐tance and bow from the hips until they are cheek‐to-cheek and lip‐to‐ear. Then each kisses at the air around the other's ear lobe. Nobody knows why kissing is in. Natives say they have been doing it for the past two years, but don’t know why they started. Rule 1: Men never kiss women on first introduction. Rule 2: Even among friends, men wait for women to initiate kiss. Curious fact: men who give women “I‐want-to‐be‐kissed” stares always have to set‐tle for handshakes. Horns—This may be the last city on earth where drivers cling to the quaint old belief that traffic will move if honked at loudly enough. Even Paris has given up on the horn, but not New York. Freeze 300 machines in an intersection and all will start wailing threats to smash the others right in their fenders. They will, too, for New York automobiles are extremely hot blooded. Nothing arouses them like 200 yards of unblocked asphalt dead ahead. With tires, gears and pistons screaming, they leap forward as though on open turnpike to Pitts‐burgh, then slam to a howling stop at the next light, throwing off tire rubber and hurling bodies around inside. It will not do to wag a finger at them if nearly run down at a I street crossing; they will only lean up against you and nuzzle your hips with their radiators. Easy on the Orangeade Theater — expen‐ sive and inaccessible. Except for shows with a death rattle, box offices never have tickets. Ticket agencies usually do—for a substantial added fee. In‐ termissions create dreadful human strains. For example: Went to see “Dylan.” (Fine play, even at $7.50 per seat, plus $1.50 ticket agent's charge.) Intermission arrived, and with it, problems. Thirsty. Bought half pint of boxed “orangeade” for 40 cents, an overcharge of approxi‐mately 800 per cent. Tasted like potash in an acid solution. Everybody out in alley, smoking, drinking potash, analyzing play furiously. “This is the story of an irresponsible man,” observed an in‐dignant young responsible man to his girl. Others expatiating on stage lighting, sets, Alec Guinness's voice, Dylan Thomas's poetry, quality of first‐act striptease. Why does everyone have to stand around for ten minutes loudly miss‐ing the point of plays in New York? Answer: When you pay $9 a seat and have a ten‐minute intermission, you must persuade yourself and eavesdroppers that you are not only buying an unforgettable experience but are also the type of person who can savor it a full $9 worth. Cold as Rameses Some suggestions: Squash “orangeade” sales. Overprint programs with large notice reading: “Relax —$9 is no more than you would pay for an average second‐rate meal anywhere in midtown Manhattan.” Building—New Yorkers are always talking about how dull the new buildings are. They are right, but the worst of the new buildings is their coldness. The lobbies of the new hotels and the Pan American Building exhale a chill as from the unopened Pharaonic tombs and in their marble labyrinths there is an evil presence that hates warmth and sunlight. Regrettable facts: These buildings are not created for people. They are created for real estate speculators. Before long they will cover all Man‐hattan, and everybody here will go as mad as the automobiles.

269-> Observer:; The American Family's Green Elephant
WASHINGTON, May 30—One of the biggest rackets in the country today is grass. A statistician has figured that Americans will spend $1.5 billion on their lawns this year, and this sum barely begins to express the toll that grass will exact from the society. The number of man‐hours and boy‐hours that will be wasted mowing, trimming, fertilizing, planting, currying and watering grass is incalculable. Men will collapse of overexertion in grass culture. Millions of hours will be spent listening to grass bores. Respectable citizens will be silently blackguarded by their neighbors for grass failure. Neither Goats, Cows Nor Lovers Hundreds of thou‑ sands of children will be started down the road to neurosis by parents with grass anxiety. (“If I catch you playing on that grass once more, it's up to bed!”) Valuable weekend sleeping time will be destroyed by grass‐proud neighbors running their power mowers through the morning dew. And what will the country get for it all? Grass. There is nothing wrong with grass when taken in moderation. It nourishes the herbivorous beast, cools the concrete city and cushions tramps and lovers. The fact is, however, that we are letting grass get out of hand. To begin with, we have perverted most of grass's natural functions. A lawn is not grown to nourish the goat or cow. Any goats or cows that got onto it would be, like the children, sent immediately to bed. Tramps and lovers are hustled off it by the police. The grass must be respected. As a result, most grass has become virtually useless and the grass around the typical American home has become a money‐gobbling albatross, or, to switch metaphors, a green. elephant. Status Without Value The sensible way to build a house, as the Romans discovered 2,000 years ago, is to put a blind wall up against the street line and face the living quarters onto a central court or yard. Instead, we set them back from the sidewalk and fill the wasted space With grass. What purpose does the grass serve? It cannot be used to sustain a cow. The cow is certain to wander into the street and collide with an automobile. The family cannot picnic on it. It affords no privacy. For the same reason, it is useless for courting or sunbathing. Although useless, it cannot be ignored, for a family is judged in its own neighborhood by the quality of its lawn. And so, the grass must be constantly beautified, fed, manicured, combed, caressed. Grass is the least rewarding of all status symbols. The gleaming land cruiser parked in front of the grass may be ludicrously loaded with chrome, but at least it will move you around the country. The coach lamps on the portico may look pretentious, but at least they relieve the dark. The Happy Grass Captive The grass does nothing but drink money, exhaust en‑ ergies, crush spir‑ its, destroy sleep, create tensions and interfere with the watching of baseball games, and sprout insolent signs ordering humans to keep off it. Recently, there have been some evil developments in the grass racket. One such is the rise of the powered grass mower. Until a few years ago, it was sufficient to keep the grass cut. Then we came to a time when status depended on keeping it cut with a powered mower, one of the century's more dangerous machines, what with its ugly propensity for slicing off toes. This year it is no longer enough simply to cut the grass, or to cut it with a power mower. It must be cut with a powered mower which can be operated from a driver's seat. One of the oddities about the American's surrender to grass is his insistence that he likes. it. Catch him perspiring in his useless Zoysia, and he will tell you, “Great exercise. Keeps me out in the sun,” or some such rubbery rationalization. No use telling him that he could get the same results from tennis or lying on the beach, for he will come back with a cutting piece of grassmanship. (“Say, you’ve really let your clover get away from you, haven’t you?”) The question we must each ask ourselves is, “When is this grass going to start earning its keep?”

270-> SOVIET PUBLISHES 2 KAFKA STORIES; But Journal Denies Move Means Ideological Shift
MOSCOW, Feb. 19—The January isue of Foreign Literature, the popular Soviet magazine that offers a supervised keyhole look at Western literature, has been in heavy demand. For the first time in Soviet history it offers translations from Franz Kafka's work. The publication has been aceompanied by official protestations that the appearance of writings long barred in the Soviet Union did not necessarily mean a shift in the ideological attitude toward the writer, who died in 1924 at the age of 40. “We wanted to familiarize Soviet readers with the strong and weak aspects of Kafka's work,” Boris Ryurikov, the editor of Foreign Literature, declared after speculation among Western critics that political and esthetic considerations were behind the Soviet decision. 2 'Typical’ Stories Printed To introduce the Soviet readers to Kafka Foreign Literature selected two stories it considred “most typical” of the writer's work. They are “In the Penal Colony,” which was written in 1914 and deals with an institution resembling a concentration camp, and “The Metamorphosis,” in which a young man is transformed into a huge insect. Although Soviet authorities deny that this first look at Kafka represents a new ideological thaw, it is evidently a result of a gradual de‐Stalinization of literature in last five or six years. The Russians acted under pressure from other East European Communists who are less dogmatic in their literary restrictions, and as result of growing contacts with West European writers. Although Western interest in Kafka was widespread in the nineteen‐thirties and reached a new high after World War II he was virtually unknown in the Soviet Union even among prominent writers. Kafka is not mentioned in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. Viktor Nekrasov, a Soviet writer, has related how he and two other noted authors, Vera Panova and Daniil Granin, met Alberto Moravia, the Italian writer, in Leningrad in 1956. “He asked us something about Kafka,” Mr. Nekrasov wrote. “We looked at one another in silence and could not reply. At that time we had not even heard of Kafka.”

271-> Soviet Said to Doom 9 in Big Fraud Ring
MOSCOW, Feb. 26—Nine persons have been sentenced to death as members of a Moscow fraud ring involving Soviet officials, according to reliable sources. Four others have been given 15‐year jail terms and about 10 others lesser prison sentences after a two‐month trial of 23 persons, all of whom were found guilty of having participated in a private enterprise ring. Eighteen of the accused are understood to be Jews. It was not known how many of the nine sentenced to death were Jews and whether they included the ringleader, identified as Shakerman, who re‐ceived a separate death sen‐tence earlier this month. The only other memnners of the ring who have been. identied in the press are Roifman and Galperin; both are Jewish names. The ring was said to have netted three million rubles ($3.3 million) by using mental patients to produce knitted goods, which were then sold through illegal retail outlets in market places and railway stations. In an appeal to Premier Khrushchev, made public Feb. 17, a group of distinguished Western citizens, including six Nobel Prize winners, expressed concern that about half of those executed in the Soviet Union for economic crimes in the last three years were Jews. Soviet authorities have steadfastly denied that the nationality of the accused in crimes of embezzlement, bribery, theft of state property and so forth had any bearing on the cases. Last October, Izvestia, the Government newspaper, demanded a major show trial of the Shakerman ring as a deterrent against economic crimes which have shown no indication of declining despite the imposition of the death sentence since 1961. Izvestia identified some of the Jewish accused by name and added. “We mention the Jewish surnames . . . because we pay no heed to malicious slander that is being stirred up in the Western press from time to time. It is not Jews, Russians, Tatars or Ukrainians who will stand trial — criminals will stand trial. Plans for a show trial were shelved, presumably because of the involvement of bribetaking Soviet officials. When the trail opened without publicity late December, the public and Western newsmen were not admitted. Outsiders were understood to have been barred from the courtroom because the bribetakers were to be identified during testimony. The officials are known to include two former masters of the Kursk Railroad Station, one of the busiest railroad stations of the Soviet capital. They were given seven‐year prison terms last September for having accepted 1,300 rubles ($1,443) and other gifts from the Shakerman ring. In return build two market stalls to retail its illegally manufactured wares on the main square in front of the station and a third in the main waiting room.

I mean, you ever pick up the phone and think, ‘This line could be tapped’?” Course not. I mean, why should I think that? I mean, even if I thought that, you know, why should I worry about it? I mean, I'm loyal and all that. Why should I worry if they want to listen in?” “You ever read?” “Read a book?” “A book, yeah.” “Sure I read a book now and then. James Bond. Norman Mailer. Books like that.” “Well, suppose you found out James Bond wasn't written by the man who's supposed to write him at all—what's his name—?” “Ian Fleming ” “Yeah, suppose you found out that, instead of being written by Ian Fleming, James Bond was written by a bunch of Government workers trying to make you hate the Communists?” “You mean bureaucrats? You're crazy. Bureaucrats can't write James Bond, man. Anyhow, I hate the Communists already. You hear that, Mr. Hoover? I hated the Communists before I ever heard of James Bond.” “I just said suppose. Look, the paper says here that the U.S.I.A. is secretly bankrolling books that promote Government policy. Then they slip the books into the bookstores, and, you go in and buy them, thinking they're written by some bookish guy or other, and you read them, and you get a big dose of Government line without knowing you're getting it, see?” “What's this U.S.I.A.? Is that like the C.I.A.?” “I don't know. All I'm saying is suppose.” “Suppose the Government pumped me full of official line without my knowing?” “Yeah. How'd you feel about that?” “All right, now. Just wait a minute. Answer me one question: Who's buying the book?” “You're buying the book.” “You mean the Government's using my money to get this book written and then I've got to go to the bookstore and use my own money to buy this book that's been written with my money?” “How you feel about that?” “I think I ought to get the book free, straight from the Government.” “But the Government doesn't want you to know the message is coming from them, see? So they fool you into thinking it's coming from some free‐thinker or professor. That way you admire the message more than if you got it right from L.B.J. on the television.” “Say, that Government of ours is pretty clever. They make you pay double to have yourself brainwashed. A Government that sneaky can't be a soft touch for Khrushchev.” “Yeah, but I mean, man, it's spooky..It's not only like they're listening to you all the time on the wiretappers, and watching your speed on the radar, and peeping in your bankbook with the tax‐checking machine, but now they're conditioning you to think like they want you to.” “Nothing wrong with that, man.” “Nothing wrong with that?” “Of course not. It's for your own good. Look: You think they're listening to you all the time, right? Well, with this book idea, you don't have to worry about that any more. They pump the certified message into you with the books, and when they tap you, you're thinking just like them. I mean, all right, so it's a little expensive, but it's worth it knowing you've got a Governmentcertified mind.”

273-> NEW G.H.Q. FOR P.G.A.; Palm Beach Gardens Is Home of Golf Group
PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla.—This suburb of West Palm Beach, which in three years has grown from a cow pasture to a city of 1,100 houses and 3,000 residents, is the new home of the Professional Golfers Association. The association has moved here after 18 years in Dunedin, Fla., and is occupying a new $850,000 clubhouse and two parallel 18‐hole championship golf courses. This represents a total investment of $1,250,000, exclusive of the 450‐acre golfing area. The latter was donated to the association by John D. MacArthur, the founder of Palm Beach Gardens. The new golf courses were designed by Dick Wilson of nearby Delray Beach. They will be the setting this winter of a number of tournaments in which 2,000 of the 5,200 members of the P.G.A. are to participate. The opening event will be the P.G.A. National Golf Club Match Play championship on Jan. 15‐19, for which there are about 400 entries. Prizes will total $10,000. Those who are eligible to play on the new courses are memhers of the P.G.A., homeowners in Palm Beach Gardens, topranking amateur golfers and the members of any golf club in the United States that has a P.G.A. member as its pro. During January, February and March, however, nonmembers of the P.G.A. will be restricted as to the number of holes they will be allowed to play. In other months, there will be no restriction. The P.G.A.'s new headquarters lies west of U.S. 1 and just east of the Sunshine State Parkway. An interchange will be built soon to give ready access to and exit from the golfing area. At present, the readiest access is from U.S. 1. Palm Beach Gardens is seven miles north of West Palm Beach. The golf courses and clubhouse are about 10 miles from the center of West Palm Beach and west of the Palm Beach Gardens residential area. These courses, along with about 15 others near by, give rise to this area's boast as a “golfing capital.” Altogether, there are 33 courses in Palm Beach County. The P.G.A. clubhouse includes both dining and social halls, one of which has a 24‐foot brick fireplace. There is also a large terrace from which spectators can watch tournament play. There are no lodging facilities. however, so visitors will have to find accommodations in Palm Beach, West Palm Beach or the Riviera Beach area. —C.E.W.

274-> Soviet Family Law To Protect Children
MOSCOW, Feb. 16—A Soviet law being drafted on marriage and the family will make an unmarried father responsible for his children. The new legislation, to be published shortly, will also simplify present complicated and expensive divorce proceedings without returning to the “postcard” divorces of the early Soviet period—so called because either spouse could divorce the other simply by mailing a notice to the Bureau of Vital Statistics. Details of a reform of the family law, long in preparation, were disclosed today by Olga P. Kolchina, a member of the Bills Committee of the Supreme Soviet (Parliament), in an interview with the trade union newspaper Trud. In discussions of recent years on drafting new legal principles governing marriage and the family, there has been sharp criticism of present laws relating to illegitimate children. Since the law of 1944, in which strong bonds of family life were reasserted after an early period of lax social relations, the paternity suit has been eliminated from Soviet jurisprudence and the state has stepped in to assume a large part of parental obligations. A child born out of wedlock is not treated as its father's child. The father's name is left blank in the birth certificate. Despite the Soviet theory of full equality of all children, whether born in or out of wedlock, the distinction made on the birth certificate inevitably attaches a stigma to illegitimacy. Under the new proposals, the certificate will have to list the name of the unmarried father. Provision is made for court action to establish paternity if the natural father does not come forward voluntarily. In the early Soviet period, when the responsibilities of family life were reduced to a minimum, an unmarried mother could demand support from the father of her child. At that time the problems of tracking down and identifying missing fathers often baffled inexperienced Soviet authorities. It is presumed that the Soviet Union has now reached a more mature stage of social organization that will enable it to establish paternity and enforce payments for support. Under the impending reform, divorce cases can now come directly before a people's court for decision. Under the complex and expensive procedure established in1944, when divorce, for the first time since the Revolution, became subject to a judicial decision, petitions had to be submitted to a people's court with a fee of 10 rubles ($11). The court was obliged to take steps to reconcile the two parties. If no reconciliation was effected, a petition had to be filed with the next higher court. Only there could a divorce be granted. Fees ranged up to $220 —three months' salary for some Soviet workers.

276-> U. S. Olympians Get Off Lightly For Clash With Austrian Police
INNSBRUCK, Austria, Feb. 7 (AP)—Three members of the United States Olympic winter sports teams were released from custody today. Two re ceived suspended sentences and one was acquitted in criminal court after all three had been fined after appealing short prison sentences by a police judge. The sentences and fines were the result of a bruising clash early yesterday with Austrian police. After two separate hearings, Bill Marolt, 20 years old, of Aspen, Colo., a skier, and Mike Hessel, 21, of Eugene, Ore., and George Farmer of Seattle, tobogganists, were fined for minor offenses. Then, in criminal court, all further charges against Hessel were dropped while Marolt and Farmer drew suspended sentences for attacking and insulting police. A charge of unauthorized use of a car was dropped when the owner, Andé Montant, a French ski‐sweater manufacturer, said the Americans had his permission to use his car at any time and that he would not press charges. The Americans accused the police of Gestapo methods and their lawyers said they might bring formal charges of brutality against the Innsbruck police. Farmer's face looked battered when the Americans appeared in criminal court but the others appeared unmarked. The case had its start after a gay farewell party Wednesday night for a group of departing Polish athletes. Afterward, according to court testimony, Ma rolt drove away in the car, which was parked in front of an inn. When he went the wrong way down a one‐way street, he was pursued by police, who overtook him at the railroad station. Police testified Marolt resisted and refused to leave the car for questioning and that when they pulled him out, he kicked one policeman and broke the officer's finger. Farmer and Hessel, who had walked to the station, attempted to free Marolt and a wild fight followed. All three were arrested and remained in jail until this morning. A police judge sentenced all hree to short prison terms last night, but on appeal the sentences were commuted to fines. Marolt was ordered to pay $170 ,nd Farmer and Hessel $16 each. In criminal court, Judge Franz Obholzer sentenced Marolt to three months for attacking police and Farmer to 3 ½ months for attacking police and using profane language. The sentences were suspended, but each was put on probation for three years. The probation is in effect any time they are in Austria. The sentences were suspended, but each was put on probation for three years. The probation is in effect any time they are in Austria. Judge Obholzer would not allow any discussion in court of the allegations of police brutality, saying: “It is not the police who are accused here, but the three defendants.” The United States Olympic Committee announced no disciplinary action would be taken axainst the three. “They have been punished enough,” said the Alpine coach, Bob Beattie.

277-> Lehman Corp. Increased Assets To $29.83 Per Share in 1963
The Lehman Corporation, a closed‐end investment company, reported yesterday that net as­set value per share last year advanced from $25.48 to $29.83. Net asset value a share is ar­rived at by dividing total net assets by the number of shares outstanding. Total net assets, according to Lehman's annual report, rose from $294,923.379 to $353,729,864 in the 12 months to Dec. 31. The number of shares out­standing remained unchanged at 11,859,263. Unlike a mutual fund, or open‐end investment company, a closed‐end does not continuously offer new shares or stand ready to “buy back” shares from holders wishing to redeem them. Instead, a closed­end investment company's shares are traded on the open market. As such, the net asset value per share does not neces­sarily reflect the market value of such shares, which may be above or below it. Shares of the Lehman Cor­poration, which is managed by the investment banking firm of Lehman Brothers, are traded on the New York Stock Ex­change. In 1963, dividends totaling $1.21 per share were paid to shareholders from capital gains Common‐stock holdings ac­counted for 94.9 per cent of the fund's total net assets on Dec. 31, compared with 91.5 per cent a year earlier. The fund's 10 largest common‐stock holdings had a consolidated market value of $100,993,852 on Dec. 31, and had been acquired for $14,419,­804. The largest single holding was 43,000 shares of Xerox Corporation, with a value of $18,404,000. Major purchaser by the fund in the final quarter of last year included 15,000 shares of Chese­brough‐Pond's, Inc.; 12,500 of Colgate Palmolive; 3,882, Dow Chemical; 30,000, Kewanee Oil Company “B”; 10,000, National Biscuit and 10,000, Rayonier. Major sales in the three months included 15,000, Ameri­can Home Products; 15,000, Delhi‐Taylor Oil; 50,000, North­ern Ontario Natural Gas; 63,­000, Mead Johnson, and 15,000 Varian Associates. The General Public Service Corporation, a closed‐end in­vestment company, reported yesterday that total net as­sets rose from $76,140,181 to $84,628,804 last year. .

278-> U.S. OFFERS PLAN FOR TARIFF CUTS; Seeks to End Impasse With Common Market Through Compromise Measure; NEGOTIATOR IS HOPEFUL; Washington Proposal Would Reduce the Exceptions to Leveling of Disparities
GENEVA, Feb. 26—The United States made a major move today toward overcoming its differences with the European Economic Community in an attempt to assure the success of the Kennedy round of tariff negotiations. After having presented Washington's proposals to a committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, W. Michael Blumenthal, deputy trade negotiator for the United States, said, “I am hopeful for the success of the Kennedy round and expect that it will open on May 4 as scheduled.” The community, or Common Market, holds that when one country has a relatively low tariff and its trading partner a high one, the low tariff should be cut less than the high one Mr. Blumenthal told the GATT committee that the United States could accept the community's proposed formula for dealing with disparities under two conditions. The first, he said, would be the acceptance of an “automatic criterion” that would protect third countries from being injured under the disparity rule. Washington's second condition was the acceptance of another “automatic criterion” that would exempt from the rule those cases in which a country imports an item in “substantial volume” despite imposing a high tariff on it. Under the negotiating formula proposed some time ago by the Common Market a disparity would exist when one country's tariff is double that of the o and the two tariffs are separated by at least 10 percentage points. This means that the disparity rule would apply, for instance, when one tariff is 10 per cent and the other 20 per cent, but not if the first is 5 per cent and the second 10 per cent. The Common Market, which is made up of West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, asks that when the disparity rule is applied, the low tariff be cut only 25 per cent, while the high tariff would be slashed the full 50 per cent. The United States proposed today a higher cut on average than 25 per cent by the country invoking the benefit of the proposed disparity rule. However, an exact percentage was not mentioned, nor were the United States views on the “automatic criterion” for exceptions to the disparity rule spelled out. The United States made its offer based on the Common Market's approach to the disparity issue as an alternative to what Washington viewed as a preferable solution. United States officials said the favored proposal used a “cut‐off” formula. By this it was meant that no country could claim a disparity against a tariff of less than 40 per cent. Also, the tariff of the country making the claim would have to be at least 10 percentage points less than that the disparate one. Under this American suggestion, the disparity rule would not apply if the low tariff country does not import or does not produce the item in question. The Common Market had indicated in connection with its own disparity proposal that such exceptions would be acceptable. United States spokesmen also emphasized that Washington's proposals were not aimed solely at the Common Market. They were made, it was stated, in the hope of helping the more than 70 GATT nations to reach a negotiating formula acceptable to all. It has been estimated that about 1,000 items would be exempted from the full 50 per cent cut by the Conmon Market under the disparity rule it proposed. Either of the United States counter proposals would reduce by half these exemptions to the proposed 50 per cent cut, it is claimed. Robert S. Pennock, vice president of the Leesona Corporation, has been re‐elected president of the American Textile Machinery Association. James H. Hunter, president of the textile machinery division of the Crompton & Knowles Corporation, has been elected vice president of the group.

280-> City Bridge Creator, 85, Keeps Watchful Eye on His Landmarks; O. H. Ammann Views 8 Spans by Telescope From Suite in Carlyle 32 Stories Up
He is a lean, elderly man in a high starched collar. Briefly he sits at the window of his apartment, 32 stories up in the Carlyle Hotel, and he seems restless. Then he fetches his telescope, points it out the window and soon is focusing on a tall, red tower 12 miles away—a tower of the Verrazano‐Narrows Bridge, which stands 680 feet above water off the shoreline of Brooklyn. He can see cranes swooping atop the tower, chunks of steel being hoisted up. Sometimes he can even see the men swinging from the cables. And the sounds, he can imagine them all: the rattling of the riveters, the clanging of the wrenches, the echoes of the superintendent yelling up from the barge below the bridge. O. H. Ammann, who designed the bridge, was confined to the Carlyle yesterday with a cold, but he is never far from the sounds and sights that he has created. Even at the age of 85, which he will reach today, Othmar H. Ammann is in command. From the bedroom window of his five‐room apartment he can see the George Washington Bridge, which he considers his greatest achievement, and from another window he can see other bridges that he designed —the Bronx‐Whitestone Bridge, the Throgs Neck, the Triborough, the Hell Gate, and the little green pedestrian bridge across the East River to Wards Island. From his living room window he can see parts of the Bayonne Bridge and the Verrazano‐Narrows, the latter possessing a span of 4,260 feet, the largest suspension bridge in the world. To master his gigantic design, Mr. Ammann had to take into account the curvature of the earth: The two 680‐foot Var‐ razano‐Narrows towers, though exactly perpendicular to the earth's surface, are one and five‐eighths inches farther apart at their summits than at their bases. But somehow it is the George Washington Bridge, completed in 1931, that still gives him his biggest thrill, and every time he and Mrs. Ammann drive past it, they bow and gently salute. “That bridge was his firstborn, and it was a difficult birth,” a friend explained. “And he’ll always love it best.” When asked yesterday to describe the feeling that the George Washington evokes in him, Mr. Ammann thought for a second, then said, “It is as if you have a. beautiful daughter, and you’re the father.” His homage to his "daughters,” however does not mean that he pays the tolls; when he wishes to cross one of his bridges, he flashes a special pass, and the collector salutes him and waves him through. Mr. Ammann, who has the ruddy, deeply etched facial outlines of a mountain‐climber (which he was, in his younger days), was born on March 26, 1879, in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Graduating in 1902 as a civil engineer from the Swiss Fed‐, eral Polytechnic Institute, he came two years later to the United States. Within three years he began to make his mark in America, first as an engineering investigator. A cantilever bridge across the St. Lawrence River near Quebec suddenly collapsed on Aug. 29, 1907, carrying with it 86 workmen. Only seven survived. Mr. Ammann, though he was then only 28, worked with an investigation team of engineers, and they concluded that the main factor in the failure was a lack of proper knowledge by the engineers of the “proportioning of compression members.” Mr. Ammann was also among the board of engineers called to investigate the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in July of 1940. They concluded that this failure was due to “excessive oscillations caüsed by wind actions.” Throughout his own career, his bridges have known no tragedy through his own engineering miscalculations, and yesterday he conceded that he was “lucky.” “Lucky,” snapped his wife, disagreeing. “Lucky,” he repeated, silencing her with a quiet, gentle authority.

281-> CIRCUS MARCHING INTO TOWN TODAY; Teething Elephant and 300 Other Animals to Arrive
The gorillas arrived last night, but the baby elephant, which is teething, will arrive today and will be driven to its destination in a taxicab. The teething baby elephant, the gorillas and some 300 other animals are functionaries of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, and most of them will be coming into town today for the opening of the circus at Madison Square Garden tomorrow night. At about noon today the long, silver‐colored, streamlined circus train will, pull into the Harlem River railroad‐ yards at 132d Street and Lincoln Avnue, in the Bronx. Then the parade through the city's streets will begin. At about 1 P.M., elephants, ponies, horses, zebras, camels, Ilamas and other beasts will detrain for the 14‐mile march to the Garden. This is the route they will follow: From the Mott Haven yard to Lincoln Avenue; right on Lincoln to Bruckner Boulevard; left on Bruckner to the Third Avenue Bridge; across the bridge to 128th Street in Manhattan; along 128th to Second Avenue; south on Second to 86th Street; west on 86th to Fifth Avenue; south on Fifth to 85th Street; through Central Park along the transverse to West 86th Street; west on 86th to Columbus Avenue; south on Columbus to Ninth Avenue; south on Ninth to 48th Street; east on 48th to Eighth Avenue; north on Eighth to 49th Street and into the Garden. Miss Mae Lyons, the circus's ballyhoo artiste, said yesterday that she was trying to arrange either for a large Checker taxicab or a limousine to transport the baby elephant from the railroad yards to Madison Square Garden. “He's teething,” Miss Lyons said, with motherly concern, “and I don’t think he can walk all that distance. He's a year old, and he weighs about 400 pounds, and he's about 3 feet high.” She did not know how many teeth the baby had already. Since some cab drivers are fussy about picking up even human beings, Miss Lyons thought she had best try to rent a cab in advance for the baby elephant. Miss Lyons said the circus was arriving from Philadelphia, where it played its most recent engagement. In its tour, Miss Lyons said, the circus “had to turn people away everywhere, except in Baltimore, where we had an extended stay.” “In Venice, Fla., we had to turn away 5,000 people at our rehearsal,” she said. The circus will run for 48 days, from March 24 to May 10.

Mr. Patterson, speaking at a luncheon‐lecture of the Men's Council of the Newark Museum, said that a team of museum professionals was in Moscow considering three ways of exchange between the museums—personnel, information and exhibitions. Mr. Patterson. who has twice visited the Soviet Union for preliminaiw talks, said that it had been agreed that there should be an interchange of a minimum of sét Soviet and six American museum professionals a year, representing museums of art, history and science. He said that the exchange would provide opportunities for study, research, lectures and travel.

284-> ‘Cindy,’ a Musical Fantasy, Is at the Gate
THE basic material of “Cindy,” the musical fantasy that opened last night at the Gate Theater, is obviously thin. Yet, the show has the habit of intermittently lighting up the tiny stage of the Second Avenue playhouse. Just when you think that things are going from bad to worse, up pops a number bursting with enthusiasm and energy. If “Cindy” has its good moments, then give major credit to. a young company of performers, who sing and dance ’ with exuberance and overflowing spirits. “Cindy,” if you have not guessed by now, has a Cinderella theme. Only in this instance, Cindy is one of three daughters of the Krellers, who own a Jewish delicatessen in downtown Manhattan. The Krellers are ambitious for their other daughters to marry, but not particularly so for Cindy. When the Rosenfelds—rich friends—sponsor a charity ball at the Plaza for the Keep Israel Green Fund, Cindy is left behind to attend to the groceries. But, an admirer of Cindy's, whose aunt works a night shift in the garment center, borrows a dress and makes it possible for her to attend. At the ball, Cindy wins an original oil painting by Mrs. Rosenfeld because her foot fits a slipper —not glass, just plain doe skin. But the Cinderella theme of “Cindy” has a bit of a twist. Although Cindy meets her prince—in the person of the ’ Rosenfeld boy who is studying to be a doctor — she chucks him for a local admirer. Joe Sauter and Mike Sawyer, authors of the book, have found an amusing idea. There is a sly, quiet humor in their story, but, unfortunately, they have not successfully developed it. Despite its impudent, lighthearted moments, “Cindy” moves slowly and clumsily. The Cast CINDY, a musical. Book by Joe Sauter and Mike Sawyer. Music and lyrics by Johnny Brandon. Staged and choreographed by Marvin Gordon; presented by Stuart Weiner; associate producer, Jerry Grace; orchestrations and musical direction by Clark McClellan; musical conductor, Sammy Benskin; scenery by Robert T. Williams; costumes by Paricia Quinn Stuart; lighting by Martin Aronstein; production stage manager. Nathan Caldwell Jr. At the Gate Thealer, Second Avenue and 10th Street. PRINClPALS: Jacqueline Mayro, Sylvia Mann, Johnny Harmon, Lizabeth Pritchett; Thelma 0 iver, Dena Dietrich, Amelia Varney, Mike Sawyer, Joseph Masiell, Frank Nasasi, Tommy Karaty, Mark Stone. Jacqueline Mayro, who made her stage debut here as Baby Jane in “Gypsy,” sings and dances the title role with assurance and buoyancy. Johnny Harmon, who plays her admirer, and Joe Masiell, as the rich young man, are ingratiating, and they can belt out a song in professional style. As the unprepossessing sisters who nag Cindy, Amelia Varney and Dena Dietrich know how to tickle the risibilities. Sylvia Mann, as Mama Kreller, and Frank Nastasi, as Papa Kreller, make the most of the comic moments. And Mike Sawyer and Lizabeth Pritchett, as the Rosenfelds, are snobbish in a warm sort of way. Also deserving praise is the team of dancers—Thelma Oliver, Tommy Karaty and Mark Stone—whose dancing and singing is spirited. The 14 songs by Johnny Branaon are generally undistinguished. The best, perhaps, are the sardonic “Think Mink,” the introspective “Who Am I?,” the amusing “If You've Got It, You've Got It,” a blues song, “Call Me Lucky,” and the satiric “What a Wedding.” Marvin Gordon's fast and furious direction hides some apparent flaws and Robert T. Williams's scenery is utilitarian. Conventional as it is, “Cindy” has some noteworthy assets.

289-> CIVIC RIGHTS FOE IS FLORIDA VICTOR; Burns Is Winner Over High —Edmondson Is Upset
MIAMI, May 26—Florida Democrats today nominated Mayor Haydon Burns of Jacksonville, an economic conservative and foe of the civil rights bill, for the governorship. In the Republican Presidential preferential primary, a slate of delegates pledged to support Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona at the Republican National Convention lost to a group of “no‐preference” delegates. Mayor Burns, who is virtually assured of election, defeated Mayor Robert King High of Miami Mr. High supported the rights measure during the campaign, a bitter contest in which his opponent attacked him as “the N.A.A.C.P. candidate.” Unofficial, but almost complete, returns from 2,156 of the state's 2,279 precincts showed: Burns. 602,885 High 456,073 In the Republican contest for Florida's 34 convention votes, returns from 1,876 precincts showed the unpledged delegation leading, 55,204 to 39,459. The delegate fight was significant from a national standpoint: Goldwater supporters had stepped up efforts for the pledged group, saying that its victory would help the Senator in the race against Governor Rockefeller in California's June 2 primary. The Democratic gubernatiorial primary was considered a test of the depth of opposition to the civil rights measure here in the South's most “Northern” state. The outcome indicated that President Johnson might encounter more difficulty in November than had been expected when he seeks to return Florida to the Democratic fold in a Presidential race for the first time in 16 years. In the Democratic Presidential preferential primary, a slate pledged to President Johnson had no opposition. The primary also returned a famous Democratic name to politics. Elliott Roosevelt, the son of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who is now a Miami business consultant, scored an overwhelming victory over 13 oppo‑ nents for the post of Democra- tic national committeeman. The Burns sweep extended from the pine barrens of the panhandle in the northwest to the Gold Coast resort areas in the southeast. Mayor High carried only two major counties, Dade, his home, and Pinellas (St. Petersburg). Mayor Burns ran up heavy pluralities in the pro‐segregationist areas of central and northern Florida. He must face Charley Holley of St Petersburg, the Republican gubernatorial nominee, in the general election. But Floridians have not elected a Republican Governor since 1872.

292-> Maine Hopeful on Sugar Beets; U.S. Allocates Large Area in Aroostook County for Output
BOSTON, May 2—The word for sugar beets in Maine is stability. After years of ups and downs in the potato market, the recent allocation by the Department of Agriculture of 33,000 acres in Aroostook County for sugar beets is being hailed. M. Peter Jordan, agricultural‐industrial representative of the Maine Department of Economic Development, attending a meeting this week in Boston, said, “I could hand you the telephone book for any place in Aroostook and any number you called you'd get the same answer.” Wendell Phillips, president of the Northern National Bank at Presqkue Isle, said, “We are very, very enthusiastic about the prospects, particularly the stabilizing effect on the potato industry.” The banker said the new industry not only would create more jobs but it also would help to revive the potato, industry, which he said has been in difficulty for a number of years. In Caribou, Jack Roth, president of Beaver Brook Farms, Inc., said sugar beets would produce “an additional cash crop, as well as giving a tremendous boost to the entire economy.” Moreover, Mr. Roth said, sugar beets would coincide with the late cash crop season. The usual potato‐digging season runs from Sept. 10 to Oct. 15. Beets not only would overlap but extend beyond, right up to frost, he said. “There also is a plus, stabilization of a depression‐ridden potato industry,” Mr. Roth said. Similar sentiments were echoed by Howard Cousins, vice president of the Bangor & Aroostook Railroad, with headquarters in Bangor. The railroad had been active in promoting a sugar beet industry and was “very happy” with the results, Mr. Cousins said. The railroad man said that an engineering feasibility study undertaken last year by LockGreene Engineers, Inc., of New York showed that about $1.5 million in transportation revenue should result. Mr. Cousins said, “We couldreasonably expect to get about half of that, the rest going to other roads and to trucking.” The Bangor & Aroostook counted $12.2 million in gross revenue in 1963, so “another $750,000 or so is significant,” Mr. Cousins said. In his most recent letter home, Senator Edmund S. Muskie, Democrat of Maine, hailed the birth of a new industry. He noted that the first mortgages on a refinery to be built in Aroostook would I be guaranteed by the Maine industrial Building Authority, which he helped to establish in 1957, when he was Governor. The sugar beet refinery will be built somewhere in the county at a cost of $17.5 million by the Great Western Sugar Company of Denver, Colo. Some of the financing will be done by the Area Redevelopment Administration as well as by some insurance companies and banks. Mr. Jordan, discussing the situation here the other day, explained that allocations of sugar beet acreage would be limited to from 75 to 100 for any individual operator. He said: “No one is going to make a killing out of this, because acreage and contracts are going to be negotiated through the Maine Sugar Beet Growers Association in cooperation with the sugar division of the Department of Agriculture.” The state agent said that sugar beets would be used in crop rotation in conjunction with the present system of rotating oats and cover crops like clover in accordance with accepted management practices. Maine has about 145,000 acres of potato land, most of it in Aroostook County. The county lies in the north bordering on Canada. Maine is one of the few potato‐raising areas of the world that employs barrels as a standard of production. Thus, it talks of producing about 175 barrels of potatoes an acre. There are 165 pounds of potates in a barrel. In recent years, there has been a movement to grow peas as a supplemental cash crop. And the industry has become large enough so that General Foods has a freezing plant for its Birds Eye brand at Caribou, and the Great Atlantic & Paciifc Tea Company has a similar operation at Fort Fairfield. Maine's potato industry, observers say, has suffered more from intracounty rivalry, lack of a centralized storage system and antiquated marketing practices than it has from the rise of potato‐growing areas elsewhere. “The last of the rugged individualists are still in Maine,” one man said, “and the farther north of Bangor you get the ruggeder they are.” The increase in chain stores has meant fewer buyers and more sellers, with the buyers able to play off one seller against another. Aroostook is divided, roughly, into three To the north are Fort Kent, Caribou and Van Buren. In Central Aroostook are Limestone, Presque Isle and Mars Hill and to the south is Houlton. Rivalries started, old‐timers say, when individual communities raced horses on the snow. It extended in more recent times into baseball and basketball teams. And it spilled over into farming, particularly potatoes, with one area grading and marketing potatoes its own way and another having its own ideas.

295-> CHURCH TO RAISE HIGH SCHOOL PAY; New Catholic Range Will Bid for Lay Teachers
To attract lay teachers to Roman Catholic high schools, the New York Archdiocese will establish a salary schedule in September that will place its schools in a better competitive position with the public schools. The scale, it was learned yesterday, will range from $4,600 to $7,900 a year with a possible maximum of $8,300 for teachers with additional preparation. At present the basic scale, adopted in 1961, is $3,800 to $7,000 in 17 steps. The current New York City scale for most high school teachers is $5,700 to $9,570 with a possible top of $10,445. Further increases are due in April. July and next January. The new schedule for lay teachers will be among the highest in the nation for Catholic high schools, according to Msgr. Edward M. Connors, associate superintendent in charge of secondary schools. It is intended to offset to some degree the public school competition and to reduce the large turnover of lay teachers. Many of them, it was noted, have used the Catholic schools as training grounds before moving on while others have been attracted to the public schools by economic reasons. Indicating that the new scale would be only a beginning step toward better salaries, Msgr. John Paul Haverty, Archdiocesan Superintendent of Schools, informed all principals of the Catholic high schools that “pay scale and benefits should be periodically reviewed to take into account pay scales of local public schools and schools operated by religious communities in the area.” The schedule will apply to 10 schools in the archdiocese, including six in New York City. The others are in Poughkeepsie, Goshen, White Plains and Hartsdale. The schools in the city are Cardinal Spellman High School, 1991 Needham Avenue, the Bronx; Cardinal Hayes Memorial High School, 650 Grand Concourse, the Bronx; Bishop Dubois High School, 505 West 152d Street; Cathedral High School, 560 Lexington Avenue; Monsignor Farrell High School, Oakwood Heights, Staten Island, and Countess Moore High School, Graniteville, Staten Island. It is expected, Monsignor Connors said, that all the 90 secondary schools of the archdiocese will adopt similar schedules within the next year or two. Several, he added, already have salary scales that are about comparable. High schools not directly under the jurisdiction of the archdiocese but subject to its supervision are operated by religious communities. The salary program covers 15 steps or years in contrast to 14 in the public schools. It provides $300 extra annual compensation for department chairmen and $10 extra annually for every postgraduate point up to a total of 50 points. There is also a separate additional scale for extracurricular activities. This includes such categories as track coach, $1.500; football or basketball coach, $1,000, and swimming coach $500. The contract provides for tenure, or job security, after three years, enrollment in Associated Hospital insurance and State Disability Insurance paid by the employer, and membership in the pension plan after the third year. All lay teachers will be required to continue graduate studies or in‐service courses; keep abreast of new developments in the field; “be impartial, fair and firm in the exercise of authority,” and teach students “to live tolerantly in a mixed and heterogeneous society.”

308-> At a Loss For Words; SELECTED POEMS OF ANDREI VOZNESENSKY. Translated and with an introduction by Anselm Hollo. 107 pp. New York: Grove Press. $3.50.
FROM Pushkin to Pasternak, Russia's greatest contribution to world iiterature, poetry, has been the most impenetrable to the English‐speaking public. Among the problems which bedevil the translation of verse from Russian to Enggish are fundamental differences in language structure, the remote‐ness of the symbols, images and associations which are the stuff of poetry — and, simply, the scarcity of literary people, let alone poets, who know both languages well. The Stalin era was, of course, not an auspicious time for the improvement of the art of translation from the Russian. After the purges of the 1930's, poetry, as Pasternak remarked, ceased to exist. Lately, however, Russia's young post‐Stalin poets, with their liberal inclinations and mass followings, have aroused great curiosity in the West. Unfortunately, the boom in Russian poetry has not raised English translation standards. Some U.S. publishers have evidently been overstimulated by reports of Moscow poetry readings with audiences of 15,000, and editions of Russian verse numbering 100,000 copies. Translations by functional illiterates in Russian, and especially, English, have been rushed into print by publishers muttering of new Pasternaks. The result has been a certain bewilderment, skepticism, and even hostility among American readers for the new poetry of Russia. The volume of translations of Evtushenko, published in New York last year, has surely brought that fine poet into greater disrepute among Americans than the attacks of his malevolent Soviet critics can have discredited himamong Russians. The latest victim is Andrei Voznesensky. This reviewer hereby pleads with all those who will read tnis volume translated by Anselm Hollo to accept the following judgment on faith: Andrei Voznesensky is a splendid modern poet. Voznesensky's preoccupations, his fantasies, images and associations should be entirely accessible to the Western reader — particularly his “discovery of Anmerica,” the cycle of poems written in 1962 after a brief visit to this country. True, some of Voznesensky's idiom—his puns, rhymes, neologisms and assonances—cannot be expected to cross the language barrier. Yet his work, like all good modern poetry, however “difficult,” is intended to make sense. To put it plainly, Mr. Hollo has reduced Voznesensky to gibberish. He has obviously never asked himself what the poet was trying to say and, therefore, even when he produces an accurate word‐forword translation, he creates an effect which is now associated with machine translating. When the machine has been badly programmed, i.e., when it has not been instructed in the full range of meanings of a word, images are destroyed or made senseless. Take one of scores of examples: “my eyes were slamming shut on your women like latches.” The Russian original of the word “latches” here in this context actually means the shutters of a camera. The image of the poet's eyes opening and shutting like shutters is lost. Similarly, Mr. Hollo writes, “Am I yelling!—Or are the kiiegs cutting into my eyeballs?” The Russian original of “yelling” here also means weeping. The poet in fact is asking himself whether he is crying or whether the strong light is making his eyes water. APART from this, some poems are marred by grotesque mistranslations of an even more serious kind—Mr. Hollo converts a man's shorts into cowards (p. 100), and, for some completely mysterious reason, women sidewalk vendors (latoshnitsy) have become a “trembling black grove” (p. 23). Mr. Hollo compounds his misinterpretations of the original by an insensitivity to the logic and the rhythm of the English language. Moreover, he makes Voznesensky use completely inappropriate vulgarisms (“Columbus, don't be a worried cube” or “O you kiddiecat”) . Four‐letter words have been introduced where there is no suggestion of sex or scatology. Take, for example, Voznesensky's fantasy about the effects of biological mutation owing to radiation: “Rolls‐Royces will be born of women.” Mr. Hollo has transformed this into a gratuitous tribute to British technology: “Rolls‐Royces are f— our women”. Voznesensky's “discovery of America” is one of the most exciting works in modern poetry. America's discovery of Voznesensky will require further exploration.

Tonight, however, Mr. Downie said he had learned that Mr. Treulieb had been suspended by the international on the same charge. Mr. Downie said the actions underscored the “political bankruptcy” and showed that “whenever opposition develops to the C.W.A. policy of 'sweetness' with the New York Telephone Company, Joe Beirne [Joseph Beirne, the international president] must report to arbitrary suspension to preserve his tottering political empire.”

314-> Assert Independent Role at Gathering of 200,000 to Mark Buddha's Birth —Khanh and Lodge Are Absent
SAIGON, South Vietnam, May 26—In nationwide celebra tions today of the 2,608th anniversary of Buddha's birth the South Vietnamese Buddhists reasserted their claim to be an independent force in the coun try Solemn services and demonstrations gave testimony to the strength, discipline and solidarity of the Buddhists in a war‐weary nation plagued by civic apathy. More than 200,000 people filled the streets of central Saigon for sunrise services and parades. Officials said the crowd was the largest that had assembled in the capital in 14 years. The northern city of Hue, a Buddhist stronghold, was a blaze of light from lanterns and candles. Wayside shrines drew crowds in towns and villages throughout the country. It was on this day a year ago, accord ing to the Buddhist lunar calendar, that clashes with the police in Hue set off a revolt move ment that ended in the over throw of President Ngo Dinh Diem's regime last November and the death of the President. The Buddhist speakers neither criticized nor praised the present Government of Premier Nguyen Khanh, who did not attend the ceremonies. General Khanh, himself a Buddhist, was scheduled to participate in the sunrise service along with the head of state, Maj. Gen. Duong Van Minh. Neither appeared. The new Government has been treading an increasingly delicate path between the country's Buddhist majority and articulate Roman Catholic mi nority. The Catholics have ac cused the Buddhists of treating them with the same degree of hostility that the Buddhists say they suffered under the regime of President Diem, a Roman Catholic. Religious tensions have been high in the weeks leading up to today's celebrations. A Catholic demonstration scheduled for last Sunday was canceled on orders of the Archbishop of Saigon, Nguyen Van Binh. He was reported to have acted after receiving Government warnings that Catholic‐Buddhist clashes might occur. Tonight, the Archbishop is sued a statement giving a clear hint that the Catholics might schedule a new demonstration, in response to the Buddhists. He said his cancellation had applied only to period leading up to today's anniversary. Also absent at the sunrise service on the downtown banks of the Saigon River was the United States Ambassador, Henry Cabot Lodge, who made a public show of befriending the Buddhists during the Diem regime and immediately after the November coup d état. The British, Australian and Chinese Nationalist ambassa‐dors attended. The United States Embassy was represented by a second secretary. An embassy spokesman said the absence of Mr. Lodge lacked significance in the context of Catholic‐Buddhist relations, He indicated that the Ambassador had not wanted to take time away from his duties. Despite official disavowals, Vietnamese and foreign observers considered the absence of Mr. Lodge, General Khanh and General Minh as highly significant. United States officials are known to be disturbed at Buddhist tendencies toward a neutralist policy in South Vietnam's war against the Com‐munist Vietnam insurgents. Most Buddhist spokesmen deny advocating any such policy. Since the downfall of the Diem regime, Buddhist organizations have not taken an active role in politics.

315-> Make‐Up Advice For Teen‐agers Attracts Crowds
THE most popular in‑ structor in Brooklyn these days is a pretty, 20‐year‐old blonde named Karen Jones. Any teacher trying to drill mathematics or English into a high school class would envy the rapt attention Miss Jones gets from the teen‐agers who flock to see her at Abraham & Straus. Her subject is the most fascinating one to womankind of any age: how to be more attractive, how to curve an eyebrow or deal with a shiny nose. Last week, several hundred high school girls turned up at the Revlon counter in the cosmetics department where Miss Jones is in charge of a new service designed to guide the young through the intricacies of modern make‐up. Unlike the popular conception of teen‐agers with plastered‐on make‐up and teased hair, the eager faces of the x201C;pupilsx201D; were well scrubbed and hairwas simple. This  to the fact that most of the girlsin the group were from parochial schools where make‐up is not encouraged. Gerry Russo, an attractive 16year‐old who attends Bishop McDonnell Memorial High School and who a hostess, explained that makeup was not absolutely forbidden at her school, but that it had to be discreet. “Eyebrow pencil, light lipstick and a little mascara are okay,” she said. “The problem is that a girl has to know what type she is. A girl who's 17 can get away with the drab look, while one who's 14 can't.” Gerry explained that the “drab look”—also called the “Beatle” —meant purposely uncombed bangs, eye make‐up, but no lipstick. A trio of 15‐year‐olds, intent on finding out how to do their eyebrows, said they were not wearing make‐up because they did not know how to put it on; besides they did not have time in the morning to do anything but comb their hair. Lynn Bromberg, 16, of Midwood High School, who was wearing wellapplied eye‐liner, was looking for a translucent base and for fashion advice, The Beatles may still be the idols of Brooklyn teen‐agers, but their hairdos are not imitated. “Beatle haircuts are only for boys,“ several girls agreed. “Boys like girls to have long hair.” When questions like “Do you wear rouge all over your face or just on your cheeks?” had been satisfactorily answered by Miss Jones, some of the girls wandered up to the second‐floor Junior High shop where beach fashions were being modeled by more young Brooklynites. The fashion shows and the special make‐up counter are part of a program that Abraham & Straus is beaming at young girls. It has included a baby‐sitters’ clinic, sewing classes and, this summer, bridge lessons for teen‐agers will be added, according to Miss Pat Allen, who coordinates these activities.

316-> Industries Will Get Merger Guidelines
WASHINGTON, May 15 —An entirely new approach to the enforcement of the antitrust laws is about to be attempted by the Federal Trade Commission. Under the new program, the commission will conduct studies of the competitive situation in specific industries and, upon completion of its inquiries, issue broad rules that will indicate to business, in advance, whether or not certain types of mergers would be prosecuted by theFederal agency. The first such industrywide study was ordered by the F.T.C. today. It will involve the development of standards for the approval or disapproval of mergers of cement producers with their, customers and suppliers ‐so‐called vertical mergers, The commission's decision to order the cement industrystudy was an outgrowth of a merger case involving the Permanente Cement Company of Oakland, Calif. The commission ruled today that Permanente's acquisition of a direct competitorin the cement business, the Olympic Portland Cement Company of Seattle, had violated the antitrust provisions of the Clayton Act. However, the agency said it did not have enough information on which to base a decisipn concerning the legality of Permanente's acquisition of two producers of ready‐mixed concrete that had been customers of Permanente. The idea of conducting basic economic studies of various industries in order to develop standards to guide the F. T.C. in ruling on mergers was largely conceived by Commissioner Philip Elman, who wrote the agency's opinion in today's case. The new approach appears certain to raise some anxieties in the business community, simply because of its newness. But it also appears possible that it may ultimately win considerable business support for several reasons. For one thing, publication of standards by which mergers in specific industries would be judged by the commission would remove many of the uncertainties that now surround almost any proposed merger. Mergers of a type that the commission may find to pose no threat to competition would not be deterred by fears of subsequent challenge in the courts. The F.T.C. presumably would be ready and willing to give prompt answers as to whether or not it would let pass without challenge any merger in an inldustry it had studied. In addition, in Mr. Elman's opinion, at least, the new standards would be designed to take into account economic reasons why certain mergers should be permitted instead of concentrating entirely on reasons why they should be blocked. In a recent little noticed speech in which he outlined the commission's new antitrust approach, Mr. Elman said: “While we want to discourage merger activity that has the effect of fostering or entrenching monopoly power, at the same time we should not discourage merger activity by small firms aimed at building them up into effective competitors or mergers and joint ventures that are necessary for new entry into noncompetitive markets.” Business complaints that Government antitrust activities have prevented the buildup of new competitive units have been widespread in recent years. The rules the commission plans to develop in the industries selected for antitrust study would cover, among other thines. the following points: ¶Whether there are particular products markets in which economic concentration is so great that future mergers should be prohibited entirely. ¶Whether there are certain product lines in which future mergers should be forbidden to companies beyond a certain size but should be encouraged for concerns of smaller size. ¶What the permissible limits are of mergers not only between direct competitors but also between suppliers and customers and between businesses in wholly unrelated lines of activity. In his opinion in the Permanente Cement case, Mr. Elman said that vertical integration of suppliers and customers in the cement industry “is of growing importance and urgency and has apparently assumed industrywide dimensions. “Where a problem involves an entire industry made up of a large number of firms, it may be uneconomical, inefficient and inequitable to proceed exclusively on the basis of individual adjudicative proceedings. “Industrywide problems require, so far as is practicable, industry‐wide solutions.” The commission therefore ordered a study “appraising the general economic facts and market structure” in the cement industry. The opinion made clear that antitrust suits in the cement industry would not be suspended pending the outcome of the study. The question of the legality of the specific acquisitions by Permanente Cement of customer concerns was ordered remanded to a commission hearing examiner, who would take additional evidence and make a new decision to recommend to the agency. Today's action set aside a ruling by Walter K. Bennett, a hearing examiner, that Permanente had illegally acquired two Portland concerns—the Pacific Building Materials Company and the Readymix Concrete Company. However, the commission upheld Mr. Bennett's ruling that Permanente's acquisition of Olympic in 1958 violated the antitrust laws: Permanente was ordered to take action to divest itself of Olympic within one year.

319-> CIVIC CENTER PLAN CALLED ‘ADVANCE’; Architects Praise Portions of Revised Proposal
Twelve leading architects and planners praised yesterday some aspects of the city's revised plans for the new Civic Center. Last February they said the earlier proposal was so limited in scope the project was “doomed to failure.” The group found the new proposal for the 60-are center in Lower Manhattan a “very considerable advance,” particularly in its plans for handling Brooklyn Bridge traffic and in the use of a sunken mall leading northward from City Hall. However, the architects criticized some other aspects of the design, including a 54-story skyscraper as its center. The project, which has been taking shape for many years, seeks to create a unified and esthetically satisfying relationship between City Hall and existing and planned governmental buildings in the City Hall‐Foley Square area. The area is bounded by Canal Street on the north, Park Row and Baxter Street on the south and east, and Broadway on the west. The earlier proposal was adopted by the City Planning Commssion on April 18, 1963. It would have cost $168,300,700. Cost estimates of the revised plan have not been developed. The architects said last winter that the first plan did not provide an adequate framework for the kind of center required by a city of New York's importance. The revised proposal, announced a month ago, calls for the skyscraper — consolidating several planned buildings—to provide a dominating structure in a large park, on an axis with City Hall to the south. The new manifesto, which was sent as a letter to Mayor Wagner, was signed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, winner of the 1959 Brunner Memorial Price in Architecture of the National Institute of Arts & Letters; Peter Blake and Douglas Haskell, managing editor and editor of Architectural Forum; Marcel Breuer, designer of the UNESCO Building in Paris, and Walter Gropius, co‐architect of the Pan Am Building here. Also Burnham Kelly, dean of the College of Architecture, Cornell University; I. M. Pei, planner of the Boston Civic Center; G. Holmes Perkins, dean of the School of Fine Arts, University of Pennsylvania; Jan Rowan, editor of Progressive Architecture; Paul Rudolph, chairman of the Yale University department of architecture; Hideo Sasaki, member of the President's Commission on the Fine Arts and Jose Luis Sert, dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Architecture. The 12 architects objected to the skyscraper as a central symbol for the center on the grounds that it is likely to be dwarfed by larger commercial structures nearby. The slender tower “intrudes and dominates,” they said. They suggested that “a well‐defined public space, one of great quality and distinctive character” would, make a more appropriate and lasting symbol for the center. They urged that the building, instead of a tower, be treated as a “wall,” which, with other buildings, would enclose the main central space. They urged a study of cross‐island automative traffic, a problem they said was not solved in the plan, and recommended that the city reserve additional land north and south for future governmental use. The Board of Estimate has approved the concept of a Civic Center. It still must act on the specific details.

320-> Export Drop Is Factor
One major element in the Soviet‐Chinese dispute has been what the Chinese consider to be deliberate economic by the Soviet Union. They con tend that the withdrawal Soviet technicians in August, 1960, and the steep drop in Soviet exports to China have been major causes of their economic difficulties. Soviet exports of machinery to China were $498.8 million in 1960. They dropped to $27.1 million in 1962. In 1960, Russia exported $100 million in petroleum products to China; this fell to $79.7 million in 1962. Total Soviet exports to China dropped from a peak of $900 million in 1959 to less than $300 million in 1962.

321-> Washington Is Unhappy Over Outlook for Trade Conference; U.S. DIDN'T WANT THE U.N. PARLEY; Doesn't Relish Being Placed in Position of Having to Say ‘No’ to Poor Lands
WASHINGTON, March 21 —At the botton of its collective heart, official Washington views the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Trade and Development with about the same Ienthusiasm as it views the approach of the hay‐fever season. Washington did not want the conference in the first place. It does not relish being in the position of saying “no” to practically everything that will be proposed by the poorer countries, but that is exactly the position it will be In. And yet the United States, even if backed all along the line by the other industrial countries, will be in a small minority. While producing vast majorities for unacceptable schemes may win only publicity for the less‐developed countries and few practical results, it is still not a pleasant stituation for tlie miriority. One element of the•einbarras= sing-siivation for the United States is that the Government here admits to a considerable extent the underlying assumption of the conference. This is the assumption of the “trade gap,” and it has two parts. Decline Noted The first is that, by any measure, the terms of trade of the poorer countries have deteriorated over the last 10 or 12 years. This ineans that their export prices are down and their import prices are up. In addition, they have steadily been losing in their share of world trade. The second part of the tradegap assumption is that no conceivable amount of foreign aid will supply the finance for the amount of imports the poorer countries will need if they are to achieve the target of abouti 5 per cent annual growth of their economies. The only hope is for more earnings from ex- ports and, with markets for pri- mary commodities growing only slowly, this means exports of semi‐manufactured and manufactured eoods. “We must recognize that something is wrong,” says G. Griffith Johnson, Assistant Secretary of State fo Economic Affairs. But recognizing that something is wrong is a far . cry from willingness to alter, as most of the poorer countries want, the basic international trading structure evolved since World War II. The United States thus will oppose special tariff preferences for imports from less‐developed countries; automatic compensatory financing plans, under which money would go to the poorer countries to offset the deterioration of their terms of trade; plans for artificially high prices of primary commodities moving in world trade, and a range of other plans. The United States will back some innovations, such as greater use of regional common markets among the poorer countries. But its basic position, according to State Department officials, will consist of these. six themes, all largely defensive: 1. An open, non-discriminatory and liberal trading system remains the best hope for the less‐developed countries. This means a strong defense of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its basic trading rules. 2. There should be no use of trading devices as a disguised means of granting aid, through such means as rigged prices. 3. The resporisibility for eeonomic development of the poorer countries is as much, or more, theirs as that of the rich countries. This is known as the concept of “shared responsibility” and involves such things as treatment of foreign capital, avoidance of inflation and the like. 4. There are not two blocs —the rich and the poor — but a “continuum” of less‐developed countries, with some much farther along toward development than others. This means their uroblems differ. 5. The Westernindustrial countries compare favorably, in both aid and trade, with the performance of the Communist countries in the assistance they give to development. 6. Within the free world itself, the United States has a creditable record, again with respect to both trade and aid. That this position will be music to the ears of the poorer countries is highly doubtful. But the United States is determined to risk unpopularity rather than, yield to demands for changing fundamentally the way international economic relations have been conducted.

322-> INVESTORS SEEK FRANCO WYOMING
A group of European and American investors are seeking to acquire a 66 per cent interest in the Franco Wyoming Oil Company through a tender offer for 820,000 shares, at $55 a share. If successful, the offer would require an outlay of $45.1 million. Franco Wyoming, owned chief­ly by French interests, conducts oil and natural gas production operations in this country, pri­marily in Texas, through the Franco Western Oil Company, a wholly owned subsidiary. It also has some ranching operations here and shipping interests in France. Another major asset of the company is its portfolio of in­vestments in the stocks of sev­eral major oil companies. The latest figure available for the market value of the securities was $33.8 million at the end of 1962. The same portfolio today would be worth over $40 million. Franco Wyoming had net in­come of $1,759,601, or $1.52 a share, in 1962 before a special credit of $142,881, or 12 cents a share. It has not released its 1963 report yet. Dividend in­come from its investments in 1962 was $1,306,411. The tender offer was an­nounced yesterday by the in­vestment banking firm of Lazard Freres & Co., which said it was acting as an agent for Franco European Invest­ment N. V., Midhurst Proper­ties, Inc.; and Western Proper­ties Corporation. Franco European Investment is controlled by French invest­ors and Midhurst Properties by British interests. Stanley de J. Osborne, a partner of Lazard Frères and former chairman of the Olin Mathieson Chemical The tender offer price of $55 a share, compares with the recent bid price of $4850 a share for Franco Wyoming stock in over‐the‐counter trad­ing here. The bid price was $40 a share a few weeks ago and as low as $35 earlier this year. The principal market for the company's shares is the Paris bourse. Lazard Frères said the tender offer would expire at 5 P.M., Eastern Standard Time, April 22, unless extended. It said the purchasers might elect to buy over 820,000 shares if more than that amount is tendered. If less than 820,000 shares are tendered, it said, the purchasers might elect to buy all tenders but shall not be obligated to do so. The invitation for tenders is being transmitted to European holders of Franco Wyoming through Lazard Frères & Cie., Paris. Shares may be delivered to the Chase Manhattan Bank here or Lazard Freres & Cie., Paris. Franco Wyoming maintains headquarters in Paris and in Wilmington, Del. A spokesman Frères said the man­agement had been notified of the offer yesterday. Carl H. Pforzheimer Jr., a partner in the securities firm of Carl H. Pforzheimer & Co., is a vice president anid director of Franco Wyoming. He could not be reached for comment on the offer.

327-> City Moves to Prevent Gouging By Parking Lots Near the Fair
A crackdown on unlicensed parking lot operators near the World's Fair was started yesterday by the Department of Licenses. The primary object of the drive is to end wildcat operations by property owners who see a windfall from motorists, Joseph C. DiCarlo, Commissioner of Licenses, said. In addition, licensed operators will be watched to make sure they are not overcharging, he said. Mr. DiCarlo acknowledged that there was a need for more than the 20,000 parking spaces within the fairgrounds, adding that the drive was to establish orderly controls. “I don't want people to get soaked,” he said in an interview, “but at the same time I want to create as much parking as possible to make people more comfortable.” The Commissioner said inspectors had served seven summonses for failure to have license on operators of “makeshift” parking lots who had been charging $2.50 or $3 a day. These lots, he said, had found willing patrons who were seeking to avoid long lines of cars at the fair's lots, where the fee is $1.50. 10 Such Lots Reported There are about 100 unlicensed lots where cars are being parked on front lawns or small vacant plots, Mr. DiCarlo said, adding that the owners could get temporary licenses for the fair season. These licenses cost $5 for five‐car lots, with proportionately higher rates for additional capacity. He said he would expedite applications to ease parking and traffic pressure around the fair. While there have been no complaints of gouging at licensed parking lots or garages near the fair or in the Times Square area, where operators recently increased tei hrrates, Mr. DiCarlo promised that his inspectors would keep a close watch on the situation. The city cannot set parking rates, but lot operators must file their rates with the License Department and cannot change them without a 60 days' notice. Police Also Taking Action The police also have taken action to curb parking abuses and have served 27 summons on unlicensed places. They also said they were taking action against filling stations “charging what the traffic will bear,” for parking. Councilman Paul O'Dwyer, who is seeking legislation to give the city power to set parking fees, noted that Mr. DiCarlo's drive was limited because he could not control rates. He reiterated that operators who have taken advantage of fair visitors were “doing violence to the goose that even now is engaged in laying the golden egg.” The garage industry contends that only a few places in highrent areas have increased rates and have saidthis action was to cover the city's new 5 per cent occupancy tax on commercial property. They also contend Mr. O'Dwyer's proposal is illegal.

328-> City to Seek Investigation Of Navy Contract Awards
The New York City Congressional delegation will meet tomorrow in Washington with city officials, industrialists and labor leaders in an effort to win for the New York Naval Shipyard in Brooklyn a contract for the construction of a carrier awarded recently to a private shipyard. Louis Broido, City Commissioner of Commerce and Industrial Development, who announced the meeting, said the group would demand a Congressional investigation of Navy procurement policies, particularly whether the award of the carrier contract to the Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Company, Newport News, Va., violated the Vinson‐Trammell Act. The act provides for carrier contracts to be awarded alternately between Navy and pri‐vate yards. The last two carrier contracts were awarded to the yard in Newport News.

330-> A Stranger Motoring About Town Finds That All Roads Seem to Lead to Englewood, N. J.; Secret Route to Queens Bared by Traveler Who Followed Signs
A stranger to New York tried to get onto the Grand Central Parkway from the Tri borough Bridge the other day and wound up in Englewood, N.J. “I'm not sure how I got all the way out there,” he said, “but the initial difficulty was with the signs on the bridge.” This visitor's bewilderment indicates what may be ahead for other out‐of‐town motorists coming here for the World's Fair. Officials of the American Automobile Association and the City Traffic Department say they have received a number of complaints regarding misleading and confusing signs on highways in the metropolitan area. The motorist who took an unintentional journey to Englewood was confused initially, he believes, by the lack of signs for Queens on the Triborough Bridge. After crossing the George Washington Bridge from New Jersey, he drove without incident to the Triborough Bridge, where he saw a sign for Long Island, But in his unfamiliarity with New York's geography and in the pressure of midafternoon traffic he failed to relate Long Island and Queens. He knew from his road map, however, that his route lay across Randalls Island. So he followed the big arrow directing him there. Once on Ran‑ dalls he became turned around, and in due course found himself crossing George Washington Bridge after wander‑ ing over Bruckner Expressway and the Cross‐Bronx Expressway. He continued to Englewood for a reconnaissance. At that point, he said, if he could have found a rental‐car office he would have turned in his rented car and traveled by bus. Making a second try after leaving Englewood, he still saw no sign on the bridge for Grand Central Parkway. So he took the lane marked for Kennedy International Airport since he wanted to go in that general direction. Only then did he encounter an overhead sign confirming that he was already on Grand Central Parkway. The visitor's misadventure in Englewood was but the start of his tale of woe. The visitor, who had never driven in New York before, reported similar confusion in trying to follow highway markers elsewhere in the metropolitan area. Trying to drive from the Bronx to Kennedy Airport by way of the Belt Parkway in Queens, he ended up in Great Neck, L. I. “Where the Belt Parkway intersects Grand Central Park‑ way, as I now know,” he said, “I saw a big sign saying ‘South Shore,’ with ‘Belt Pkway.’ in tiny letters above it. By the time I realized that this was my turn‐off, I was past it.” When the visitor realized that he was going in a direction almost opposite to the one de‑ sired, he decided to ask questions. This decision presented further difficulty. “You can't ask anybody a question without first leaving the highway, expressway, park‑ way, thruway or whichever way it's called, and hunting for a town,” he said. “Here you find more opportunities to go astray, including the problem of gettingback to the highway, you’ve just left.” Many turn‐off signs are too small to sink into the con‑ sciousness of a motorist traveling at normal highway speed, the visitor found. “A stranger doesn't know he's gone wrong until he consults his map and finds that the place names don't jibe,” he said. “By this time, he's miles off course.” The traveler was especially critical of the turn‐off signs on the Henry Hudson Parkway, which he said displayed “small attention‐getting potential.” Traffic experts at the Auto‑ mobile Club of New York agreed that turn‐off signs are not placed far enough ahead of the intersection to give the motorist sufficient warning, By the time he sees some of them, he is in danger of speeding past.

331-> CINCINNATI ROUTS 76ERS, 127 TO 102; Lucas Sparics Second‐Half Drive With Rebounding—Robertson Gets 31 Points
CINCINNATI, March 22 (UPI) — With Jerry Lucas dominating the boards in the second half, the hot‐shooting Cineinnati Royals gained a 127102 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers today in their National Basketball Association playoff opener. Lucas, out much of the first half with three personal fouls, grabbed 15 of his 25 rebounds and scored 19 of his 25 points in the final 24 minutes. His four consecutive baskets in the fourth quarter gave the Royals a 109‐88 lead with six minutes to go and put the game out of Philadelphia's reach. Oscar Robertson, who had a game high of 31 points and 16 assists, got the Royals rolling in the second period and they outscored Philadelphia, 32—19, after a tight first quarter. Lucas re‐entered the game in the third period and the Royals had another scoring burst for an 85‐60 lead midway in the period. Hal Greer and Johnny Kerr shared scoring honors for the 76ers with 21 points. Cincinnati ptayed the game without Adrian Smith, but all three of Philadelphia's injured players—Dave Gambee, Larry Costello and Lee Shaffer—re‐ turned to action. Only Gambee, however, was able to play at full speed. There were several outbursts; of temper in the roughly played i game. The most serious was late in the first half when Robertson squared off against Paul Neumann of the 76ers after an exchange of elbows.

332-> FacuIty Dismissals In Paterson College Bring Sit‐In of 200
WAYNE, N. J., April 9—Two hundred students at Paterson State College staged a sit‐in today in the corridors of Hun­ziker Hall. They were protest­ing the fact that two philosophy professors at the teachers' col­lege would not have their con­tracts renewed because of “con­duct detrimental to the college.” The students displayed signs calling for “freedom from in­justice.” A posted sign demanded clar­ification of the phrase “detri­mental to the college” and asked for an explanation as to “how it applies to us in regard to disciplinary action.” It charged that the dismissal of Dr. How­ard A. Osmon Jr. and Frank Taylor was “highly question­able” and urged that it be re­viewed by state officials. The sit‐in, which was de­scribed as orderly by a college spokesman, was the latest in a series of incidents since seven honor students were suspended several weeks ago for “conduct detrimental to the college.” After a hearing the seven stu­dents, who, it was said, had been demanding more freedom, were reinstated. Professors Os­man and Taylor were reported to have sided with the suspend­ed students. .

333-> SPECIALISTS CALL CRITICISM UNFAIR
New York Stock Exchange members said yesterday they thought the latest Government criticism of specialists in the turbulent 27 minutes after President Kennedy's assassina­tion was unfair In interviews on the trading floor, the stock exchange mem­bers painted a somewhat dif­ferent picture from that un­veiled Thursday by the Securi­ties and Exchange Commission before a House Commerce sub­committee in Washington. Recalling the news of the as­sassination, one specialist de­clared: “It was an emotional shock—like the dropping of an atomic bomb. I was here in 1929 and what happened on Nov. 22 of last year was far worse. It was a maelstrom with no advance warning.” The S.E.C. study—requested by the Congressional group holding hearings on proposed stock market legislation—said specialists in four stocks failed to maintain orderly markets. Furthermore, the report stat­ed. the specialists sold substan­tial amounts of stock—an act which contributed to the “dis­orderliness” of the market. The dealer function of a specialist is to buy and sell for his own account—to a reasonable de­gree—when there is a tempo­rary disparity between sup­ply and demand. This is his responsibility to keep an or­derly market. The second function of the specialist is to act as a broker's broker. In its landmark study of last summer, a special S.E.C. staff noted “the conflicts of in­terest inherent in any simulta­neous combination of broker and dealer functions.” It made a This week's study criticized specialist behavior in four stocks — American Photocopy, American Motors, and Telephone and Telegraph — but did not specify the Big Board member firms by name. There are dual specialists­Rodi & Co. and Wrage & Co.­acting as specialists in Ameri­can Photocopy, the issue trig­gering the greatest criticism. The S.E.C. said these specialist units liquidated large positions minutes after news of the at­tack on the President hit the floor and also sold the stock short — a trading technique used when the price of a stock is expected to drop. In a typical stabilizing ac­tion, the specialist would buy stock when the public was sell­ing. The S.E.C. also commended several specialists for making large purchases during the drop, among them M. J. Meehan & Co. in R.C.A. stock. Charles F. Henderson & Sons is the specialist for Korvette, while Beauchamp, West & Stava acts as specialist for American Motors. The I. T. & T. specialist is Wagner, Stott & Co. The Big Board has about 350 specialists, organized into 110 firms or units. There are some 30 dual specialists, signifying two units handling the same stock. At stake here is the heart of the exchange. The investing public deals with commission brokers, but specialists spend their working days on the floor of the exchange and generally have no contact with the public. Specialists form perhaps the most powerful single group in running the Big Board itself. At the least they have a voice in key decisions. There are seven specialists serving on the 33‐man board of governors, the most influential body on Wall Street in setting policy. None of the three largest brokerage firms dealing directly with the public, in contrast, is presently represented on the board of governors. A total of seven board members come from commission houses. In yesterday's interviews, spe­cialists said repeatedly that it was not fair to judge the spe­cialist by the final 27 trading minutes of last Nov. 22, because it concentrates on the kind of crisis occuring perhaps once in an entire century. “The May 28 break of 1962 was like a Sunday School picnic in comparison,” commented a young member. “I happened to be short a lot of stock when the news hit,” said a specialist, “but I was just as concerned as the people with long positions who sold stock.” He paused a moment, then went on to say, “Those 27 minutes were like a fantasy. It wasn't that we were worried about money. We were worried about the Republic.” The exchange has said that the four cases cited by the S.E.C. are among “a number of situa­tions currently under careful re‐ The board of governors, which is charged with this responsibil­ity, meets every Thursday after the close of market. Disciplin­ary action can range from fines and censures to taking away the stock from a specialist. Sus­pension of a specialist has oc­cured only once since World War II. Some members suggested that specialists selling stock on Nov. 22 may have been freeing their capital to make bids on other stocks for which they maintain markets. The exchange is studying ways to shut down trading on even shorter notice — perhaps five minutes — as a hedge against future emergencies. Several members said they felt such quick suspension of trad­ing would be in the public in­terest. Meanwhile, a number of floor brokers expressed confidence that compromises would be forthcoming on the surveillance and regulation of specialists. “Our motives are basically the same as those of the S.E.C.,” stated a member. “I think it was Euripides who said there is no hurt that can't be healed by a little quiet talk.”

334-> Inflation issue Imperils Coalition Regime in Italy; Socialists Threaten to Quit if Curbs Delay Reform; Treasury Minister Is Insisting on
ROME, May 28—The publication of a confidential report giving a pessimistic assessment of the Italian economic position has put a new strain on the fragile governing alliance of Socialists and Christian Democrats. The report, presented by Treasury Minister Emilio Colombo to Premier Aldo Moro, both Christian Democrats, shocked the Socialists by insisting that the structural reforms they favor must give way to economic stabilization measures. This, an editorial in the Socialist newspaper Avanti said, could cause the party to quit the coalition. Lengthy excerpts from Mr. Colombo's report were obtained by II Messagero, a conservative morning newspaper. Their publication yesterday produced a storm of protest by the Socialist and other left‐wing groups in and out of the governing majority. The report simply made explicit the conflict between the Government's political and economic problems that has existed since the center‐left coalition Cabinet was formed last December. Most experts here and abroad agree that unpopular austerity measures are essential to check the inflation that threatens to blight the nation's recent spec tacular economic growth and consume its dwindling foreign reserves. At the same time, the Socialists demand costly social measures to justify their alliance with the “bourgeois” Christian Democrats and prevent their rank and file from deserting to the Communists or the dissident Socialists. With this internal contradiction unresolved, the Government has done little toward either checking inflation or adopting the Socialist reform measures. Mr. Colombo's report said that wages had gone up 12 per cent in the first quarter alone and that the money chasing goods and services had risen by 16 to 17 per cent over last year. This excess of purchasing power, he indicated, was draw‑ ing foreign imports into Italy at a rate that would produce a billion deficit in the bal‐ance of payments by the end of the year, if unchecked, and consume two‐thirds of Italy's foreign exchange resources. The minister, as paraphrased by II Messagero, said that without economic stabilization the Government could not survive. It would, he said, have to make a choice between stabilization measures with the cooperation of the unions on productivity and wage relationships, or if the unions refused cooperation, to stabilize “at any cost” including restrictions of credit and increased taxes, regardless of the perils of deflation and unemployment. Facing such a “mortal peril,” the minister suggested, it is folly to insist dogmatically on structural reforms of unknown cost and efficacy. The Socialists have pledged themselves to obtain Laws extending regional autonomy throughout Italy and severely limiting and penalizing land speculation. Such action, Mr. Colombo implied, would have an unsettling economic effect. The Socialists, who have already suffered a crippling left‐wing defection for their decision to participate in the Government, promised even before the Colombo report to “re‐examine” their position in June in the light of progress toward Socialist goals.

335-> Y.W.C.A. DISCARDS PLEDGE OF FAITH; Assent No Longer Required for Voting Members
CLEVELAND, April 21 —The Young Women's Christian Association eliminated today the pledge of faith required of all voting members. About 65 per cent of the membership, who have nonvoting status, will benefit from the action. It is regarded here at the 23d national convention as the first step in a sweeping move to revitalize the country's largest organization for women. The pledge, or assent to the purpose of the Y.W.C.A., had proved difficult if not impossible for many Roman Catholics to accept and even more so for non ‐ Christians and persons with only nominal religious affiliation. Leaders in tne movement will, however, still sign the assent. Passage of the revision was surprisingly easy. This was because a much more far‐reaching proposal striking at affirmation of the Christian faith itself was introduced earlier in the day. Delegates representing 2 million registered participants appeared shocked at the implications of the motion submitted by San Francisco. The basic purpose of the Y.W.C.A. since its inception in 1859 has been activity “to which we are committed by our faith as Christians.” Now an entirely new approach is advocated. The California resolution raised these questions: “Is it possible to maintain that we are open to all and yet require for membership and‐or leadership an affirmation of faith? ¶“Should we declare ourselves exclusively Christian in membership, while offering program participation to all ?” The response from the convention floor came in all the dialects of the country, from South Carolina and Florida Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania, from Minnesota and Kansas. “If we change the meaning of eur purpose, we would have to drop 'Christian' from our name,” one delegate said. The mood of the 2,700 women present was divided, with the majority against drastic changes. Before the delegates were the San Francisco text and a proposal by the national board to set up a study commission to evaluate the role and responsi‐ bility of the Y.W.C.A., reporting back to the next convention in 1967. The convention decided to refer both motions to a committee that is to produce a fresh draft combining salient features of each for consideration later this week. “We believe the study should make it possible for the Y.W.C.A. to decide whether it wishes to become an organization exclusively Christian in membership with program participation open to all others without membership,” said Mrs. Arthur D. Hemphill, president of the San Francisco unit, “or to rephrase its quoted purpose so that all members may affirm a devotion to Christian principles without affirming Christian faith.” Miss Edith M. Lerrigo, gen‐ eral secretary of the national organization, told the assembly that it was in for a hard time arriving at a decision. “This will be a painful study,” she said. “It may trouble and distress many who hold deep convictions. It would be easier to avoid it, to go on as we have with some members troubled but with most unaware of the issues involved.” Critical comment on the operation of the Y.W.C.A. has suggested that it may be oldfashioned and ineffective, perhaps obsolete under modern conditions. Miss Lerrigo warned that the association could “completely miss the call” to make any significant contribution to the deepest needs of the hour.

337-> In The Nation: The Incident of ‘The
WASHINGTON, April 29—President Johnson has displayed so sure an instinct for doing and saying the popular thing that the frustrated Republicans were beginning to despair it ever Would fail him. But when the other day he lifted his pet beagle by the ears to please the news photographers he forgot the fundamental political fact that for everyone who might possibly love a news photographer there are perhaps millions who unquestionably love a dog. These millions nourish no abiding resentment against Edward Noyes Westcott for the remark he put in the mouth of his fictional character, “David Harum”: “A reasonable number of fleas is good for a dog.” They accept this, though neither they nor their veterinarians agree, as fitting Westcott's design to record Yankee pragmatic philosophy. But though they will in time evaluate the President's claims for election on less emotional issues, they will never assent to the theory that it is “good for a dog” to be levitated by the ears, whether or not the reason is that “If you follow dogs you like to hear them yelp.” Mr. Johnson was embarrassed and annoyed by the unfavorable publicity of the small incident when he gave this lame explanation of it to White House guests. He was also annoyed with himself for the unique lapse in his sensory perception of what is and is not sound crowd psychology. Above all, the President is a humane man, with deep and sincere compassion for the unfortunate and the helpless, man or beast. Now that he has had this second disagreeable reminder of the restraints the Presidency imposes on impulsive displays of his natural exuberance—the first was when he released his surging energies at the wheel of his Lincoln Continental in Texas—he can find comfort in the history which recounts a really serious event that involved an ear. This ear was not a dog's but a man's. It was cut off, not pulled. And the severance led directly to a bloody war. On a homeward voyage to England from the West Indies in 1731, the brig Rebecca was boarded by the Spanish coast guard, whose commander cut off the ear of the brig's master, Capt. Robert Jenkins. The British press and the political opposition to the Government in power exploited this incident to the degree that it became a major provocation of the 1739 armed conflict between Britain and Spain—the War of Jenkins’ Ear—that developed into the War of the Austrian Succession. The President can also turn to history for the consolation that the domestic pets of other great personages have been the source of misfortunes far exceeding the passing, fugitive political. William III of the United Kingdom and Ireland was thrown by his favorite horse and died. King Alexander of Greece succumbed to the bite of his pet monkey. “Him,” the White House beagle, only yelped, which was probably a canine paraphrase of the request of the character in “Don Quixote” who said. “Try that .. . on some other dog.” If Mr. Johnson will confer with his Under Secretary of Commerce, he will find that animal lovers also made trouble for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. So much so that, although the source was not himself but a member of his family, the President thought it prudent to order that member to come home. This incident occurred when the President's third son and namesake was being tutored in the rudiments of bull‐fighting by Sidney Franklin, “The Brooklyn Matador.” The Under Secretary was on holiday in Seville at the time, after completing his sophomore year at Harvard, in the season when young bulls were in training for the arena on the ranch of Don Romuldo de Arias, at the outskirts of the city. As Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. recalled it today, he was only “playing with the young bulls” under the supervision of Brooklyn's only citizen who ever earned the honored rank of “espada.” But to animal lovers in the United States that was bull‐fighting; and their protests brought a message from the President to this department (by chance at that time in Seville) to this general effect: “Find Franklin and tell him the humane societies are on my neck and to come straight home.” Straight home he came, too.

338-> Iowa Farmer Gives Advice To Soviet on Raising Yields
MOSCOW, April 25 (AP)—The Soviet Government told its farmers tonight how to run their farms, but every word of the advice came from Coon Rapids, Iowa. The advice took the form of a major article in the Government newspaper Izvestia. Covering a third of a page, it was signed by Roswell L. Garst. Mr Garst has visited the Soviet Union several times and Mr. Khrushchev was a guest at the Garst farm at Coon Rapids in 1959. Mr, Garst advised Soviet farmers that if they wanted to increase the output of meat milk and eggs—all in short sup ply here—they must first of all produce more and better feed. He also said that the way to increase grain harvests was by using chemical fertilizers, in secticides and herbicides.

339-> Investigating Food Prices
President Johnson's request for a bipartisan commission to investigate food prices stems primarily from the plight of cattlemen. They have been getting much lower prices for their livestock, while consumers continue to pay about the same for meat purchases. According to the cattlemen, chain stores and meat packers have been profiting at the expense of both farmers and consumers. They add that cheap foreign imports, going to chains and processors, have also depressed the prices that American producers get for their quality meat, without benefiting the public. There may well be cases where the concentrated purchasing power of one or two companies has produced abuses, although the profit margins of food chains and meat packers appear moderate. An investigation may actually serve to erase the widely held notion that both farmers and consumers are being cheated by food profiteers. Rising income has increased consumer demand for better quality and higher‐priced food items. At the same time, consumers have been enticed by fancy packaging and ready‐cooked meals that require more expensive processing. The costs of processing and distribution account for the bulk of the increase in retail food prices. This is especially true for meat. Up until last year cattlemen did very well because demand for beef ran ahead of supply. This led them to increase their production at a fast rate, creating an imbalance that is the chief reason for the decline in cattle prices. The important thing about any food investigation is to keep it from becoming a hunt for political scapegoats. It is easy to point a finger at foreign competition or big food chains as being responsible for the spread between the prices that farmers get for their produce and the prices consumers pay for them, but tangible evidence is lacking. Before any action is taken either to penalize foreign competition or to protect farmers, an investigation must establish the facts.

340-> The Course of History
History can be coaxed and sometimes nudged; but it cannot be overwhelmed all at once. The time must be right. For the lawmaking process follows the currents and cross‐currents of social awareness, majority needs and crises, and ideally leads where a democratic people wish to go. Right now most Americans desire to extend the civil rights they enjoy to their deprived fellow citizens. They have said so through the bill passed by their Representatives in the House. The Senate debate on the bill's provisions may change some of the language and possibly even weaken some of the titles. But it cannot change the inevitability of an effective civil rights law. Negro organizations have broad support in demanding that the bill be passed. They want their rights not later, not soon, but now. And they are on solid ground in their need for immediate equality of citizenship. Right is on their side. And so is history. The question observers of the Senate debate are asking is how can they nudge history. The same question is being debated within the civil rights organizations in this city—where demonstrations are planned to protest racial imbalances in the schools—and around the country. What ultra‐militants in these groups must ask themselves is whether unrelated incidents —such as the threatened stall‐in on the World's Fair roads or the wisely abandoned plan to let water run out of faucets wastefully—will achieve specific civil rights goals. We think not. Undoubtedly, grandstand plays will get attention—but what kind and from whom? Civil rights organizations—as their responsible national leaders have recognized—should frustrate their enemies, not give them ammunition. Victory is sure; it should not be imperiled by rashness.

Civil rights organizations‐as their responsible national leaders have recognized‐should frustrate their enemies, not give them ammunition. Victory is sure; it should not be imperiled by rashness. As a long‐time advocate of civil rights for all citizens we believe that there must be ground rules for civil rights. We believe that the proper exercise of the right of petition implies a purpose that is clear to those demonstrating and to those whom they want to persuade. We believe that assembly should be peaceful and protected. We believe that, in demanding rights for themselves, demonstrators cannot step on the rights of others. Violence is out—on either side. To some people, civil rights amounts to thinking about the unthinkable. The die‐hards would like to let things stand as they are; to keep the Negro effectively subjugated and in second‐class position. History is not on the side of the sooners or laters; it is running in favor of civil rights now. But history should be helped and not overwhelmed by those who would serve it best.

341-> CITY UNIVERSITY ASKS MORE MONEY; Schools and Libraries Also Criticize Mayor's Budget
Faculty members of the City University warned yesterday that a lack of money might turn the colleges into second‐ or third‐rate institutions and could cost the graduate programs their accreditation. They spoke in the final day of publichearings on the Mayor's expense budget. Spokesman for the Board of Education renewed an urgent appeal for neariy $15 million in additional funds to permit reductions in class size, expanded maintenance programs, purchase of additional books and supplies, added guidance and recreational services. The city libraries also asked for more money to prevent the closing of branches an additional day each week and the curtailment of services. The hearing tegan at 10:30 A.M. at City Hall with 450 persons listed to speak and was still going on early today. As the hearing continued without a break, members of the Board of Estimate and the City Council took turns in the places at the high, horseshoeshaped wooden dais in the board's chamber. The traffic in the audience was also heavy as groups supporting various appeals came and went, mothers retrieved children and people who were far down on the speakers' list gave up and left. Prof. Bernard Bellush, speaking for the Committee on Enrollment Policy of the City University, said that the college could no longer attract competent teachers, despite relatively high salaries. because of heavy teaching loads, large class size, lack of office space and the absence of secretarial help. Prof. Bellush said that concern over excessive teaching loads had caused the Middle States Association of Colleges and Universities to question whether accreditation of the graduate schools should be continued. He added that the elimination of teaching positions that had been requested in the budget would raise the studentfaculty ratio from 15 to 1 to 19toi. Prof. Belle Zeller, chairman of the legislative conference of the university, said that as a result of efforts to expand the State University the competition for faculty members was increasing. “You can't just give us students and say ‘take them,’ without giving us the facilities and the teachers,” she said, referring to plans to expand enrollments. Mayor Wagner sharply challenged a statement by Prof. Israel Kugler, president of the United Federation of College Teachers, implying that the city had appropriated money for the completion of Shea Stadium at the expense of education. Unless the city expedites the building program of the City University “with the same degree of urgency as it did Shea Stadium and the fair, deterioration is inevitable,” Dr. Kugler said. “I think it's wrong to give the impression that because in the capital budget we had to add $4.5 million for the completion of Shea Stadlum that the money could have been used for education in the expense budget,” the Mayor declared. All the same, Dr. Kugler replied, he was asking “for the same degree of urgency for education as given to athletics and expositions.” Dr. Bernard E. Donovan, executive deputy superintendent of schools, expressed the appreciation of the Board of Education for the nearly $80 million increase in funds for the schools. He said, however, that “certain compelling problems” required a review and possibly an increase in the amount allocated. One of the “most pressing problems today,” he said, is providing pre‐school education, especially for children in disadvantaged areas. He said that it would cost $1.8 million to provide places in kindergarten for 10,000 children who cannot now attend because of lack of facilities. Parents who do not normally send their children to kindergarten must be encouraged to enroll them, he added. Dr. Donovan said that the board was seeking suitable places to rent space, including housing projects, churches, and neighborhood houses and was even exploring the possibility of converting rundown brownstone houses on the West Side into pre‐school centers. Additional funds are also needed for the education and continued training of dropouts and to carry out the school integration program. Dr. Donovan said that the board would receive next week a report from the State Commissioner of Education evaluating its proposed plan of integration and quality education. He noted that $2 million has been set aside in the budget for this program, but added: “I can't conceive of a program in a city of this size proceeding very far on $2 million.” In response to a question, he said that overcrowding in the schools could be significantly reduced if the board sent children by bus to schools out of their neignnornooas. Budget Director William F. Shea took issue with the board's contention that it would receive only $2.4 million for the introduction of new programs. According to the city's figures, the amount would be $15 million, including additional teachers required by agreement with the United Federation of Teachers, Mr.Shea said. More than 200 members of the federation demonstrated outside City Hall starting at 4 P.M. to support demands for more money for “both quality and integrated education.” The picketing ended an hour later with a rally in Murray Street at which Charles Cogen, the union president, denounced the “penny pinching” budget.

343-> STATE SENATORS GET ETHICS BILL; Measure Tightens Code but Does Not Curb Lawyers
ALBANY, March 18—A bill providing a more stringent code of ethics for members of the Legislature was introduced to night in the Senate. A similar bill is scheduled to be placed before the Assembly in the next few days. The Senate bill follows many of the recommendations of the special legislative committee on ethics, but omits a recommendation that legislators who are lawyers be prohibited from representing clients in the Court of Claims. A set of bills incorporating all the recommendations of the ethics committee is to be submitted to the Assembly, it was understood, but not to the Senate. The feeling of the Assembly leadership is that members should be given an opportunity to express themselves on the full recommendations. The Senate bill, introduced through the Rules Committee, reflected the views of Walter J. Mahoney, the majority leader, who last week asserted that any ethics measures in the Senate would not bar lawyer‐legislators from practice in the Court of Claims. Provisions Listed Major provisions of the Senate bill would do the following: ¶Place heavy penalties on persons who attempt to bribe legislators or upon legislators who accept bribes. ¶Make it a misdemeanor for any legislator to accept any gift including money, service, loan, travel, entertainment or hospitality, having a value of $25 or more if it could be reasonably inferred that the gift was intended to influence him. ¶Bar legislators front appearing before state agencies for compensation contingent on any action by the agency in respect to any license, contract, ruling, decision, rate schedule, franchise or other benefit. ¶Bar companies in which any legislator has interest of 10 per cent or more from providing goods or services of $25 or more to any state agency unless the award or contract is made by public letting. ¶Provide for complete diselosure by legislators of any interest of any amount he or his family has in any business subject to the jurisdiction of a state regulatory agency. The proposal is similar in many respects to laws now on the books that govern legislative ethics. But the bill has been rewritten to incorporate some of the recommendations of the ethics committee. On conflict of interest, the Senate proposal states: “No member of the Legislature or legislative employe should have an interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect, or engage in any business or transaction or professional activity or incur any obligation of any nature, which is in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of his duties in the public interest.” General Standards Given Th proposal includes the following “general standards”: No member or employe of the Legislature should accept other employment that will impair his independence of judgment in the exercise of his official duties. ¶No member or employe should accept employment or engage in any business or professional activity that will require him to disclose confidential information gained through his official nosition or authority. ¶No member or employe should use confidential information to further his personal interests. ¶No member or employe should use or attempt to use his official position to gain unwarranted privileges or exemptions for himself or others. ¶No member or employe should give the impression that he may be unduly influenced or affected by the kinship, rank, position or influence of any party or person. ¶A member or employe should pursue a course of conduct that will not raise suspicion among the public that he is likely to be engaged in acts that violate his trust. State Agency Defined; “State agency” as used in the sections that would restrict the activities of legislators is defined as “any state department, division, board, commission or bureau.” Legislators would be required to list their directorships and offices in any corporations and to disclose any other interest or relationship that might reasonably be expected to be particularly affected by legislative action. The secretary of the Senate and the clerk of the Assembly would be required to prepare a statement containing such disclosures from legislators before Jan. 31 each year. These would be open to public inspection. Pressure for a new code of ethics developed last year after legislators were found to have been entertained by business interests. The special committee on ethics, headed by Cloyd Laporte, chairman of the New York City Board of Ethics, was appointed by Senator Mahoney and Assembly Speaker Joseph F. Carlino.

MIAMI, Fla., (Ap)—March 26—Hialeah Park stewards today suspended Joe H. Pierce Jr., a trainer, until May 8. He was charged with negligence in protecting his horse Tamarin from receiving a stimulant. Stewards acted after a second hearing. Originally they suspended Pierce after Tamarin had won at Hialeah on March 3 and traces of the drug thozalinone were discovered. Pierce appealed to the Florida Racing Commission, which sent the case back to the stew ards. The original suspension was based on a rule that holds the trainer responsible for his horses. Pierce's attorney, Dan Chappell, said he would appeal to the commission a second time.

345-> State Welfare Agency to Teach Social Graces to Help Gain Jobs
ALBANY, Feb. 29—“Social amenities” as well as reading and writing will be taught to welfare recipients to help them get jobs, the State Education and Welware Departments announced today.About 3,500 recipients will be trained in 15 communities in the state during the fiscal year beginning April 1. The program will cost $450,000—$300,000 in Federal funds and $150,000 in state money. No local money is involved. School and welfare officials will meet here March 10 to discuss the plan. Invitations have been sent to officials in New York City and nine large counties in the state—Albany, Erie, Monroe, Nassau, Niagara, Onondaga, Schenectady, Suffolk and Westchester. Kalman Mintz, associate welfare consultant, said instruction would be given in such things as cleanliness when applying for a job. About 3,500 recipients will be trained in 15 communities in the state during the fiscal year beginning April 1. The program will cost $450,000—$300,000 in Federal funds and $150,000 in state money. No local money is involved. A pilot program was developed in Niagara Falls last fall, according to Mr. Mintz. Under the direction of Alan Welch, directoo of adult education, night classes were held three times a week. The program being developed statewide will also set up classes for vocational trainin;. Individuals will be selected by public welfare departments and the special projects will be offered through local school districts, according to a statement issued by Dr. James B. . Allen Jr., Education Commissioner, and George K. Wyman, Commissioner of Welfare. Under the plan, school officials will recruit and train school staffs, test prospective students, set up classes in the most convenient locations and make available necessary teaching and study materials. Classes may be divided into two groups, with the lower group concentrating on reading and writing, and the more advancedstudents on arithmetic. According to the Welfare Department, about 30,000 adults on welfare in the state are employable or potentially employable. They include 12,000 persons who are employed and receive supplemental assistance for their families, others who are jobless and a large number of under‐educated.

350-> New Incidents Possible
BANGKOK, March 4—Spokesmen of Malaysia and Indonesia said tonight that they would continue to abide by the cease‐fire agreement despite the failure of the talks. Foreign Minister Subandrio of Indonesia, said however, that it was likely that there would be a renewal of incidents along the 800 miles of jungle border between Indonesian Borneo and Sarawak and Sabah. The dispute that led to the collapse of the talks was over the presence of a small band of Indonesian based guerrillas who remained on Malaysian territory after the cease‐fire had been agreed upon. The Malaysians hav e insisted that the guerrillas must be withdrawn to Indonesia before Malaysia could consider discussing a political solution in the dispute. Indonesia insisted that the guerrillas had a right to remain while a settlement was being discussed. It was not clear how far either side would go in resuming the small‐scale conflict that has raged in the steaming Jungles of Borneo since early summer. “We are responsible for law and order within Malaysia and our sovereignty must be respected,” Deputy Prime Minister Razak said. Eut he deelined to say whether Malaysian forces and more than 6.000 British troops supporting them would begin a drive against the remaining guerrillas. Ganis Harsono, spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, said that Indonesia could no longer guarantee that "volunteers" would not cross into Malaysia. The Malaysians say that there have been 16 incidents inside Malaysian territory since Feb. 10. Dr. Subandrio, said Malaysia was a "bitter pill" thrust down Indonesia's throat. "If they had even tried to sweeten the pill a little by agreeing to talk at the summit level,' he added, "then the whole picture would have changed immediately."

351-> Liston's ‘Friend’ Well Rewarded; Margolis Stock Deal Laid to Personal Relationship
WASHINGTON, March 30—Visions of Grandma Moses in a prize ring and Sonny Liston behind a checkerboard filled the hearing room today as a promoter and a vending machine operator led a Senate subcommittee through the vague world of boxing's finances. The promoter, Bob Nilon of Inter‐Continental Promotions, Inc., disclosed the devious psychology by which he had “talked Cassius Clay intoeing heavyweight. champion” and Sam Margolis of Philadelphia, who received half of Liston's stock in Inter‐Continental, justified the windfall: He was Sohny's “friend” Although the Senate AntiTrust and Monopoly Subcommittee and its counsel were unable to raise more than intimations of immorality, the testimony of Nilon, Margolis and Salvatore J. Avena, a Camden, N. J. lawyer, described a few more of the events that led to the night of Feb. 25 when Clay took the title from Liston. Margolis, a tall, fat, 51‐yearold Philadelphia businessman, testified that he owned shares in a restaurant and a hotel in 1958 with such as Frank (Blinky) Palermo, sometimes described as an underworld lieutenant of Frank Carbo, now in jail. Among Margolis's customers (most of whom were local collegians) were Charles and Geraldine Liston. They all became friendly. Everybody liked Sonny, who often played checkers with the college boys, and eventually talked Margolis into letting him run up tabs as the boys did. The tabs sometimes ran as high as several thusand dollars, but Sonny always paid off after a big fight. Speaking slowly and in a soft rumble, his jowly face wreathed in smoke from a long cigar with a round green holder, Margolis told the subcommittee how he and Sonny developed mutual trust. Through a local newspaperman, Margolis was introduced to Bob Nilon, a promoter and concessionaire from Chester, Pa. By October of 1961, an agreement to form a promotional corporation of which Liston and Bob and Jack Nilon were principals was reached. But Floyd Patterson was still the heavyweight champion, and the agreement was a nonfunctional one. There was also an agreement between Margolis and Liston, to which there were no witnesses. Anything that Margolis got for Sonny was onehalf Margolis's. “I trusted Sonny,” said Margolis. “Were you his manager?” asked Senator Kenneth B. Keating, Republican of New York. “No,” said Margolis. “What was your title?” “Friend.” At that point, Margolis ignored further questions from the subcommittee and went into conference with his Washington lawyer. ‘Please continue with your narrative,” said Senator Philip A. Hart, Democrat of Michigan, gently. “I only went to the eighth grade,” said Margolis. “Please bring it down to my level, those words you use.” It was eventually established that Liston transferred 275 of his 500 shares in Inter‐Continental stock—now worth perhaps $100,000 after taxes—to Margolis, who in turn gave 50 to Avena for legal services. Liston endorsed those shares before they were filled in with Margolis's name. Under questioning, Margolis said that his cut was a consideration for getting Liston a piece of the promotion, something no fighter had ever had before. Margolis denied that Palermo, Carbo or John Vitale, another underworld figure, had any interest in his stock. With some reluctance, however, he said that a close business and social relationship with Palermo and a dinner‐table friendship with Carbo, usually after Friday night fights at Madison Square Garden some years ago. When Carbo was on trial in California several years ago, Margolis went to be a witness for him, but, because of technicality, was not permitted to testify. Both Margolis and Bob Nilon, who preceded him, denied that Liston was “Palermo's man” or that the former champion and the Philadelphia criminal had a so‐called “lifetime contract.” The subcommittee had been trying to establish a direct, current link between Liston and Palermo through Margolis. If Margolis rambled and sometime was vague (“are you clear, Senator ?” he once asked Keating), Bob Nilon was brisk and smooth and even his ramblings sounded like a salesman's talk. He spoke of his “ego” as a top‐flight promoter looking for a top‐flight attraction. “Never at any time did I consider as a remote possibility that Cassius Clay could beat Sonny Liston. Before my God, I didn't think that he had any more chance of beating Sonny Liston than if he were in the ??ing with Grandma Moses,” said Nilon. “But I thought Clay represented a great show business property, the greatest thing since Jenny Lind.” Although everyone but he and Clay were against the match, Nilon talked Clay's Louisville sponsoring group into it. “Why not get one good purse out of it ?” was his line of argument. In tough negotiations, Clay's cut was set at 22½ per cent across the board, Liston's at 40 per cent. (Half of that 40 per cent went to Jack Nilon, Liston's adviser, a fact that Bob Nilon said he did not know until his brother testified last week) . To increase Clay's share without raising his percentage, Nilon agreed on a $50,000 payment to the Louisville group. In return, there had to be a clause giving Inter‐Continental promotional rights to Clay's next fight. “Frankly,” said Nilon, “I thought when we paid that $50,000 for this return‐bout contract, it was throwing money down the drain. But later I justified it as a kind of insurance.” After the hearing, Nilon and Garland D. Cherry, his lawyer, maintained that Liston had got the best deal of any heavyweight champion. They said that Liston's stock payment to Margolis had been part of a smart income tax move, and they denied that Inter‐Continental would profit — in the long run — from losing its most valuable asset—the heavyweight championship.

352-> Steel Unions Chief Asserts Labor Shuns Federal Help
DETROIT, March 9 (AP) —The Government was told today to stay out of union affairs by David J. McDonald, president of the 950,000‐member United Steelworkers of America. Mr. McDonald told the Economic Club of Detroit that “there is an erroneous impression we, and other unions, favor Government intervention into and subsequent control over our affairs. ”That is absolutely absurd. “We recognize that Government has the right to act at any time in what it deems the public interest. But we prefer in labor‐management relations to work out our own problems, wherever possible, through the process of free collective bargaining.”

355-> HIGH COURT BARS JUDGING OF CUBA ON EXPROPRIATION; Opinion Asserts That No U.S. Bench May Question the Validity of takeovers; 1897 POLICY IS AFFIRMED; 8‐to‐1 Ruling Cites Right of Nation to Act on Its Soil—Puts Task to Diplomats
WASHINGTON, March 23—The Supreme Court ruled today that United States courts would not question the legality of a foreign government's expropriation of property within its own borders. The decision, which has major implications for international law, came in a suit by the Government of Cuba. The court upheld the Castro Government's right to sue here and said its seizures must be treated as valid for purposes of litigation. The United States Government, while denouncing the Castro seizure decrees as violations of international law, had urged the results reached today. Its view, accepted by the Court, was that the whole expropriation issue was one to be settled by diplomats, not judges. It was an 8‐to‐1 decision. Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote the opinion of the Court. The dissent, a stinging one, was by Associate Justice Byron R. White. The ruling reaffirmed a policy known as the “Act of State Doctrine.” As phrased by the Supreme Court in 1897, it says: “The courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its own territory.” This doctrine, Justice Harlan said, “expresses the strong sense of the judicial branch that its engagement in the task of passing on the validity of foreign acts of state may hinder rather than further this country's pursuit of goals both for itself and for the community of nations as a whole.” The decision leaves it to the State Department, the President and other Federal officials to contest foreign expropriations of United States property. Many weapons may be used, the Court pointed out. For example, the freeze on Cuban assets here is a form of pressure on the Cuban regime to compensate former property‐owners. The opinion also remarked that judicial noninterference in expropriation conflicts was desirable “however offensive to the public policy of this country” the seizures might be. The case arose from the sale of sugar that had been taken over by the Government of Fidel Castro. This sale involved $175,000. But much more is understood to have been awaiting the outcome of this case. The money claimed by the Castro Government cannot, however, go to Cuba now because the United States has frozen all Cuban assets in this country. The money will presumably be held until relations thaw or Congress directs some other dispotition of it. Originally the sugar was owned by a Cuban company known as C.A.V. It contracted to sell the lot to Farr, Whitlock & Co. of New York for shipment to Morocco. The sugar was seized by a Castro decree when it was on a ship in a Cuban harbor. Under the pressure of being unable to move the ship out of the harbor, the New York company signed a new contract promising to pay a Castro agency, rather than C.A.V., for the sugar, After the shipment was completed, C.A.V. and the Cuban Government both claimed the $175,000 from Farr, Whitlock. The money has been held in escrow while the suits went on. The lower Federal courts in New York rejected the claim of the Castro agency. They accepted the Act of State Doctrine in general but said it did not apply because the Cuban expropriation had violated international law. The lower courts said international law had been violated, because among other things, the seizures discriminated against United States property and had not been adequately compensated for. This view was wholly rejected by Justice Harlan today. He said a charge that an expropriation violated international law did not except the case from the Act of State Doctrine because such a charge would itself be highly disputed. The opinion noted that Communist and Western nations had wholiy different views of the legality of nationalization. It would be wholly optimistic, Justice Harlan suggested, to suppose that judicial decisions in the United States, a“principal exponent of the free enterprise system” would be accepted as “disinterested expressions of sound legal principle by those adhering to widely different ideologies.” Justice Harlan said that the courts would be freer to act if the issue were one in which there were greater “codification or consensus” in international law. He thus restricted today's decision to the area of expropriation, summarizing the decision as follows: “The Judicial Branch will not examine the validity of a taking of property within its own territory by a foreign sovereign government, extant and recognized by this country at the time of suit, in the absence of a treaty or other unambiguous agreement regarding controlling legal principles." The court declared for the first time that the Act of State Doctrine was a matter of overriding Federal law, arising out of the relationships of all courts to the foreign policy power of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government. In the past some have thought that each state's courts were free to adopt the Act of State Doctrine or not. Today's opinion said such a course would produce chaos and defeat the purpose of allowing the nation's diplomats a free hand. Justice White began his dissent by saying he was “dismayed that the Court has, with one broad stroke, declared the ascertainment and application of international law beyond the competence of the courts of the United States in a Iarge and important category of cases.” The dissent called this “a backward‐looking doctrine” and said “no other civilized country has found süch a rigid rule necessary for the survival of the Executive Branch.” Justice White was also highly critical of the majority's finding that the courts must entertain Cuba's suit at all. This, he said, puts them in the position of having to “render judgment and validate the lawless act.” He said he was especially concerned about the possibility of seizures in situations involving racial or religious discrimination, such as Hitler's seizures of Jewish‐owned property. Surely, Justice White argued, American courts should be able to look into the validity of such seizures under international. law. Lower Federal courts in the past have developed an exception to the Act of State Doctrine. This is that they may examine foreign acts’ validity if the State Department specifically says that it has no objection. Justice White urged that this concept be turned around, so that courts could pass on the validity of foreign acts under international law unless the State Department specifically objected. This position was urged by the committee on international law of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, in a brief as a friend of the court. It was rejected by the majority today on the ground that it would put too great a burden on the State Denartment. The case was argued for Banco Nacional de Cuba, the Cuban agency that brought the suit, by Victor Rabinowitz of New York. The Deputy Attorney General, Nicholas de B. Katzenbach, argued for the Government as a friend of the court. On the opposing side were C. Dickerman Williams and Whitney North Seymour of New York. They represented, respectively, Farr, Whitlock & Co., and C.A.V., the owner before nationalization. Lawyers questioned here yesterday said that there were not a large number of cases pending nor substantial sums of money awaiting disposition in similar cases. However, the lawyers said the decision might have implications in all cases involving expropriations by foreign governments.

356-> FACTORY OUTPUT RISES FOR MONTH; Narrow Gains in Production Spur Upturn in Industrial Employment in March; DURABLE GOODS CLIMB; Increase Is Most Marked for Business Equipment—Joblessness Steady
WASHINGTON, April 15 —Industrial production continued its slow but steady rise in March and brought manufacturing employment up to its highest level since mid‐1957. The big gain in jobs during the month centered in durablegoods manufacturing and also brought employment in that sector of the economy back to August, 1957, levels, the Labor Department reported. The date is a significant one, because the summer of 1957 was the last period of time when the economy was operating at what is now considered to be a full‐employment rate, with unemployment at or below 4 per cent of the labor force. Despite the gain in employment last month, the unemployment rate remained at 5.4 per cent. The rise in industrial production, which amounted to one‐half of one point, brought the Federal Reserve Board's index of industrial production to 128.2. Industrial output for the 1957‐59 period constitutes the base for this index. The increase in the output of the nation's factories and mines was most marked in the business‐equipment industries. Automobile production declined about 3 per cent during March, the Federal Reserve said, although it increased again somewhat in early April. The production of iron and steel and other durable industrial materials rose in March and steel output continued to rise in early April. Production of most consumer goods were essentially unchanged in March, the Federal Reserve said, although there was some rise in the production of furniture and other home goods. All of the Federal Reserve index figures, as well as the Labor Department's statistics on employment, have been adjusted to eliminate the effects of normal month‐to‐month changes that occur each year. The total number of jobs in the economy rose by 300,000 in March, the Labor Department said, which is about 66,000 more than the normal gain for the month. Of the increase of about 50,000 in the number of jobs in manufacturing, Labor Department officials said about 13,000 to 14,000 could be attributed to the ending of a strike at the Caterpillar Tractor plant in Peoria, Ill. Over‐all employment, exclusive of farm employment totaled 57.3 million in March.

357-> FAIR'S ROAD SIGNS CALLED CONFUSING; Engineers Find Wrong‐Way Arrows and Inadequacy
Inadequate and confusing highwway signs threaten to nullify much of the benefit of the $125 milion highway network for the World's Fair, a group of engineers said yesterday. Their criticism came after a tour of the highway system in Queens, the Bronx. Manhattan and Long Island. The men tempered their criticism by noting that officials were reviewing the situation and making plans to ease motorists' confusion. Charles J. Murphy, director of traffic engineering for the Automobile Club of New York, who acted as spokesman for the group, said: “Don't just pity the out‐of‐towner unfamiliar with the routes. The motorist who knows his way around is going to have his troubles too.” The touring engineers included Paul Petrillo, also of the auto club, Paul A. Holmes, a consultant to Long Island automotive organizations and three observers from the American Automobile Association. The engineers contended that the most inadequate signs were those directing motorists to the parking lots ringing the fair. The signs are sparse in nummber, the engineers said, and there are not enough confirmation signs — second markers backing up the first signs. The group also found it was easy to overshoot the fairgrounds, as they unwittingly proved on their long tour of the web of roads. There was also sharp criticism of the lack of big, clear highway directional markers. T. T. Wiley, former City Traffic Commissioner and now traffic consultant to the World's Fair Corporation, said that some of the parking sings had been knocked down in construc‐ tion and would be replaced by the end of the week. He stressed that the fair was responsible only for the signs indicating parking areas and said he agreed wholeheartedly with the criticism of the directional signs on the main routes, which are the responsibility of the state and Federal Governments. “They are terrible,” Mr. Wiley said. He noted that the signs' messages were misleading, arrows pointed the wrong way and in some cases, the same sign meant two things. Motorists from Manhattan who travel to the fair on the Grand Central Parkway face the most challenging task, the engineers agreed The roads from eastern Queens and Long Island have much better signs, they said. Motorists from Westchester County who use the Whitestone Expressway are in an advantageous positior, the engineers noted, if they are willing to park at the one lot outside the grounds and take a bus to the fair entrance. In addition to Grand Central Parkway, the new Van Wyck Expressway extension and the Long Island Expressway lead directly to the fair. There are no traffic lights on these highways. Northern Boulevard has been reconstructed to serve as a feeder link to the main fair roads. Roosevelt Avenue, a local road with traffic lights, leads to the northern edge of the fair. Parking for 6,000 cars has been provided at the old Flushing Airport. The rate is 75 cents a day with an additional 15‐cent charge for bus transportation to the fair: Four other parking lots with space for 13,000 ars border the fair grounds and the charge will be $1.50 a day. If a parking lot is filled, flashing signs direct ing motorists to alternate taciities have been installed. The engineers had favorable comments about the road network, and although they traveled in at rmmtdday when the traffic was lignt, they said the system should be able to handle the fair's traffic as well as the more than 250,000 daily commuters. The biggest problem along the network will come from confusion, Mr. Murphy predicted. Out‐of‐towners will slow down to stare at the exposition or to grope their way to an exit. As a result, there will be countless tie‐ups on roads that are more than adequate to handle the high volume of traffic, he added. Everyone concerned with the traffic problem agreed that on openinng day, Wednesday, it would be Impossible to objectively evaluate the road and parking facilities because of the stall‐in planned by the Brooklyn chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality.

358-> PALMER TO SHOOT FOR GRAND SLAM; U.S. Open Is Next Target for Masters Champion
AUGUSTA, Ga., April 13—ArnoId Palmer is going to Washington. The noted 34‐year‐old goif professional from Latrobe, Pa., will not become a politician, however. He just wants to win the United States Open, which will be played at the Congressional Country Club une 18 through 20. What he does there will be a key to his future plans. He'd like to achieve a grand slam in golf. Thi consists of the Masters, which he won yesterday, the United States and British Opens and the Professional Golfers’ Association championship. “If I should win the United States Open I definitely will go over for the British,” sain Palmer, “but if I don't, the chances are I'll stay here and concentrate on the P.G.A.” The P.G.A. is the only major title that has escaped him. The British Open will be played at St. Andrews, Scotland, July 8 through 10 and the P.G.A. at the Columbus Country Club, Columbus, Ohio, July 16 through 19. “That makes for a tight schedule,” commented Palmer. “It also means I would be playing the small ball in ScotIand. Then I'd have to turn around and come back and get ready for the P.G.A. with the larger ball. “No matter what happens from here on I definitely will be in the P.G.A.,” he said. Palmer expects to bein Washington to practice for the Open after a two‐week rest that will include some trout fishing in an undisclosed stream. He will also play at the Westchester Country Club, Harrison, N. Y.; in the $100,000 Thunderbird, June 4 through 7. The Thunderbird was one of seven tournaments he won in 1963. He regards it as a warmup for the United States Open. Gary Player of South Africa, the 1961 Masters champion, will remain for a few days to convalesce. Following a tonsillectomy at University Hospital today, Player's condition was reported as satisfactory. He plans to go to Nassau before rejoining the tour. Player, the only foreign contestant to win the Masters, tied for fifth yesterday at 286 10 back of Palmer's winning score.

A proposal for the drafting of a detailed plan for such a fund was voted down after two hours of lively discussion at the Commodore Hotel. The exact vote at the closed‐door meeting was not disclosed. But it was learned that the division of sentiment was so close that an initial voice vote had to be followed by an actual count of the bankers' votes.

365-> PRICES INCREASE FOR TWO METALS; Aluminum Moves Up in U.S. and Copper in London
Aluminum and copper, two key metals that compete for a host of product applications, such as electrical wire and cooking utensils, competed for investor attention last week with fast‐paced developments in prices. Giving impetus to the higher prices for aluminum in this country and for copper in the London market were expectations of bustling business activity, which would strengthen further the demand for both metals. Inasmuch as higher prices would lift appreciably the earnings of both aluminum and copper producers, the securities of both types of companies enjoyed a good run‐up on the New York Stock Exchange. Despite a high volume of operations, earnings have been depressed by the low price levels. However, the approach to prices for the two metals is quite different. The London price increase for copper came despite the efforts of copper producers to prevent it. The price increase for aluminum was forced by two producers over the misgivings of a third. The week opened with an announcement on Monday by the Aluminum Company of America, the nation's largest aluminum producer, that it was increasing the prices of hundreds of high‐volume aluminum sheet and plate products, ranging from ½ to 2 cents a pound. A typical new price for siding sheet might be 33.5 cents a pound. The increase appeared to revive the higher price trend for aluminum mill products, which began last April, but which appeared to have run out of steam in the fall. Alcoa also abolished many commodity price schedules, that is, lists of promotional prices that were offered by the mills directly to small users of aluminum in the avowed intention of stimulating greater aluminum use. It was Alcoa's contention that such a practice had gotten out of hand and had become an excuse for price cutting. The company also believed that commodity pricing saddled the big aluminum mills with hundreds of small‐volume orders that were inefficient to produce and that properly belonged to the aluminum distributor. Alcoa's moves to rectify these inequities and put its operations on a more efficient basis were generally applauded in the industry. And the price increases on mill products were supported by other producers. But on Thursday, in a surprise move, the Reynolds Metals Company, the No. 2 producer, also raised the primary price of aluminum by 1 cent a pound to 24 cents a pound for aluminum ingot. The Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Company followed and added a price rise for soft alloy extrusion, used in window frames and architectural trim. The ingot price increase apparently took Alcoa by surprise. Early in December, Kaiser attempted a similar increase, but Alcoa crushed it by refusing to go along. At the time, Alcoa said it believed the prices of mill products should be raised before the ingot price and also that too much world capacity in aluminum ingot still lay idle to make a United States price increase realistic. Last October, however, Alcoa supported a Reynolds‐led primary price increase of ½ cent a pound, which lifted the ingot price to 23 cents from 22½ cents. The price had been 22½ cents since December, 1962. A 24‐cent price prevailed from September, 1961, to December, 1962, and the previous price was 26 cents a pound. On Friday afternoon, Canada's Aluminium, Ltd., the principal source of aluminum imported into this country, said it would join the price increase in the United States market. But by the end of the business day, there was no word of Alcoa's intention. Aluminum is not traded on the open market as a commodity, and hence the price rests in the hands of producers. Other nonferrous metals, such as copper, lead, zinc and tin, are traded, and dealers and speculators often influence the price. At one time, copper prices fluctuated widely, creating uncertainties for purchasing agents who might be considering whether to use copper or some other metal. Some electrical uses were lost to aluminum when the copper price soared to 46 cents a round in 1956. Since May, 1961, the copper price in the United States has stayed stable at 31 cents a pound. Since January, 1962, the price has held relatively stable on the London Metal Exchange. This stability, which was desirable to maintain copper's competitive position, was accomplished in two ways. Copper producers around the world, in what they say were individual and voluntary decisions, cut back production at a time of low consumption to maintain the stable price. In addition, the African copper producers, Britain's Rhodesian Selection Trust, Ltd., and the Anglo‐American Corporation of South Africa, Ltd., bought and sold copper in London as was necessary to keep the price even. In recent weeks, however, there has been speculation that the price could go higher. Cited as factors were rising worldwide demand, a tightening of supplies for prompt delivery, the prospect of negotiating labor contracts this year and political uncertainties in major copper producing areas, Northern Rhodesia, the Congo and Chile. Militating against this upward pressure was the fact that considerable unused capacity existed that conceivably could be brought into production to supply the higher demand or fill temporary shortages. Indeed, a few weeks ago, R. S. T., Anglo‐American and the second largest United States domestic producer, the Phelps Dodge Corporation, announced increases in production and sales rates. The Kennecott Copper Corporation, the largest copper producer, and the Anaconda Company, have made no announcement. But on Wednesday, an unexpected, tremendous buying wave in London, possibly speculative in origin, apparently depleted the buffer stocks of the African producers, forcing them to withdraw from the market. The producers’ price of £236 a long term ton (equivalent to 29.5 cents a pound) was broken and subsequent deals were in the range of £238 to £239. Prices of copper futures soared on the New York market, although the New York cash price was unaffected. On Thursday, however, R. S. T. and Anglo‐American moved to calm the rising prices by announcing that they were removing all self‐imposed restrictions on production and sales, thus adding to the potential supply of copper available. They also said they would offer copper for sale outside the London Metal Exchange at the old support price of £236, regardless of the L. M. E. settlement price. These announcements took some of the force out of the price rise. The United States domestic price has remained stable throughout the tumult. There was no clear indication of how high the London price would have to go before it would attract copper destined for this country, thus tighteping supplies here. But observers noted that the same market forces would be at work in this country as in London.

366-> Fall Fashions
ASHION is leaping over national boundaries to take on an international character. It becomes increasingly difficult to tell the country of origin without a score card. Hardly a week passes without some ready - to - wear manufacturer from a distant shore bringing his collection to New York for inspection by American store buyers. Yesterday, West Germany was the entry in the current fashion sweepstakes. Heinz Queisser, who manufactures sportswear in Munich, and his wife, Felicitas, who designs the collection, showed fashions here for the first time—and scored an instant success. Bonwit Teller has purchased a good portion of the collection and will present it in various departments starting in August. Sportswear, as it is used by the Queissers, describes a wide range of fashions, including ski suits, raincoats, suits and dresses, stopping short only of evening fashions. “Weekender” outfits consisting of jacket, skirt and matching pants were the biggest news. This is the kind of ensemble that many American designers are also planning for fall. The Queissers explain that “the pants are worn while traveling, and the skirt is to change into when you get there.” One outfit is in brown tweed, with a lightly fitted yoked jacket. Priced at about $125, it could be worn with a black or white turtle‐neck sweater. The coats and suits, mostly in British woolens, are especially well done. The sturdy, durable look associated with German fashion design has been supplanted in these clothes by a fashionable, contemporary air.

A factional fight for control of the Republican party organization in Queens was threatened yesterday, when a rebel group said it would try to unseat Frank Kenna as party leader. The group, which calls itself the Queens County Committee for a Better Republican Party, is demanding that Mr. Kenna resign as chairman of the County Executive Committee and that Governor Rockefeller name a triumvirate to succeed him. This demand was put before the Queens County Republican Executive Comthittee on Friday night, along with several other requests for reform in party procedures. All of the proposed changes were rejected. As a result, Assemblyman Alfred D. Lerner of Jamaica, who is one of the leaders of the rebel group, said the group would enter candidates for district leadership in eight of the 13 Assembly districts in Queens. Mr. Lerner said his committee also would probably enter several candidates to oppose the regular organization's slate of delegates to the Republican National Convention. These candidates would run without commitments to any candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, which conceivably could cost Governor Rockefeller as many as eight convention votes in his drive for the nomination. It was understood that this part of the plan was not directed against Mr. Rockefeller's Presidential hopes but was intended to force the Governor to take an interest in the condition of the party in Queens. Two years ago Mr. Kenna stepped down from the titular leadership of the party in Queens, reportedly at the insistence of the Governor. He was nominally replaced by Assemblyman Fred W. Preller, who became chairman of the county committee. However, Mr. Kenna remained as chairman of the executive committee, and it is generally recognized in political circles that it is he and not Mr. Preller who actually heads the party organization. “This party in Queens,” Mr. Lerner said, “makes Tammany Hall look like a children's tea party. We want Kenna out.” His group had demanded that the county committee be convened for regular meetings on party policy, that committeemen be polled on important nominations and policy decisions, and that members of the county committee be retired at age 75. Mr. Lerner described these demands as a program to revitalize the Republican party in Queens, which has suffered a series of reverses in general elections over the last few years. The co‐chairmen of the Committee for a Better Republican Party are Carl J. Kucher, who is Mr. Lerner's legislative assistant, and Mrs. Frances Werner, a county committee member from the 12th Assembly District.

369-> Panama Irked by U.S. Proposal To Survey for Canal in Colombia
PANAMA, April 17 — Jack Hood Vaughn arrived in Panama early this morning to take up the post of United States Ambassador, vacant for the last six months. His arrival was welcomed by Panamanians with unusual fervor. They know and like Mr. Vaughn and they hoped his arrival signified early settlement of their crippling dispute with the United States. This hope was jarred and the sunny mood somewhat dispelled a few hours later, with the publication in the morning newspapers of President Johnson's announcement that the United States and Colombia would undertake a study of a sea‐level interoceanic canal. “It was an ill‐timed gesture,” said Octavio Fabrega, a member of the Foreign Affairs Advisory Committee and a leading shaper of Panama's Canal policy. “It is simply a measure to strengthen the United States bargaining position,” was the bitter comment of a member of the same committee. “We are bored with the United States threatening to take its canal somewhere else. If they think Panama is tough, they will find that other countires will not give them as much as we do.” Random comment gathered in Panama and in the Canal Zone was not encouraging to those who hope for an understanding between the two countries. "This finishes Panama,” declared a Canal Zone employe. “It's just the Yankees using the Big Stick again,” said a Panamanian clerk. The reception for Mr. Vaughn at 4 A.M. today in the steamy Panama Airport was straggly, boisterous and moving. In a telephone conversation with the Embassy here, Mr. Vaughn had ordered the staff not to come to meet him because of the hour. “I don't want you all looking blurry‐eyed at our staff meeting tomorrow,” he told the chargé, Rufus Smith. As a result, when Mr. Vaughn, a slight, gingerhaired man, stepped off the plane, his only official greeters were Mr. Smith, an Embassy press officer and the Foreign Ministry protocol chief. Besides these, there was an unofficial delegation of young Panamanians ‐ lawyers, engineers, the head of the Land Reform Institute‐who had personal links with the new Ambassador. Mr. Vaughn, most recently the director of the Latin‐American section of the Peace Corps, was formerly in the United States aid mission here. He was in charge of grants for study abroad, and arranged for about 1,000 young Panamanians to go to the United States for postgraduate study. Severino Parientes, leader of the delegation, said that 200 of these students had planned to come to the airport. When Mr. Vaughn's arrival was postponed from yesterday to this morning, it was decided to send a delegation of 10. In the airport lounge, the 10 young professionals struggled to open a 25‐footlong canvas sign, unrolling it backward and upside down, while Mr. Vaughn craned to see. It read: “Jack, the scholarship holders remember your work and greet you.”

370-> PRICES FOR COFFEE RAISED BY ROASTERS
Leading roasters and processors raised prices of ground coffee by 4 cents a pound at wholesale yesterday. Prices of the instant variety went up a cent an ounce. The rise is expected to be reflected on prices of individual brands of coffee on retail shelves within a few weeks, or when present supplies are moved into competition, according to coffee traders. The actual price the consumer will be asked to pay will depend, of course, on the individual brand he favors. MJB Company and Folger Coffee Company raised prices of ground coffee 4 cents a pound at wholesale. Folger said wholesale customers could buy any amount at the old prices until Jan. 30 for delivery by Jan. 31. MJB said buying for a period at the old prices would depend on competition. The Maxwell House division of General Foods Corporation told distributors on Friday that for 30 days they could buy a normal one‐month supply at the old prices. It raised ground coffee 4 cents a pound and instant a cent on ounce, effective today. Albert Ehlers, Inc., raised ground coffee 4 cents, but permitted customers to buy a onemonth supply at the old prices through Jan. 31. It has not decided on whether to raise instant prices.

371-> NEW METS YEAR STARTS OLD WAY AS CARDS ‘NIN, 5–1; St. Louis Scores 5 Runs Off Stallard in 5th Inning—Losers Held to 4 Hits
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., March 14—Another year opened in the same old way for the New York Mets today. They lost to the St. Louis Cardinals, 5–1, before 5,321 spectators at Al Lang Field. This was the opening game of the Grapefruit League season, as the Florida spring training competition is called. Last year the Mets dropped a 2–1 decision to the Cards in the bpener, and two years ago, when they first went into business, they were beaten, 8–0, by the Cards. What's more, the Mets never have won a regular seasonopener, either, and both . timeS the CardinaIs were the opposition. In 1962, at St. Louis, the score was 11–4, and at the Polo Grounds last April it was 7–0. The Mets cannot blame all their opening difficulties on St. Louis, however. Last week, they lost their opening game in Mexico. And they couldn't even win their opening intrasquad game a month ago: It ended in’ a tie. Since the Mets began the 1962 regular season with nine straight losses and the 1963 season with eight straight, they have never even won what the baseball people call “a second opener”—that is, the second set of opening games when the teams that opened on the road get to open at home. Nevertheless, getting off to a slow start can't be called a real problem of the Mets. It's what continues to happen afterward that hurts. Today's game offered some fine examples. In eight of the 8⅛ innings played, everything went just fine. In the other half‐inning, the bottom of the, fifth, everything went to pieces. Tracy Stallard, the starter, had turned in four nearly perfect innings. A pop‐fly single, by Johnny Lewis and a fullcount walk to Doug Clemens accounted for the only base’ runners among the first 14 Cards he faced. And in the top of the fifth, an unearned run had given him a 1–0 lead. The lead didn't last four batters. Lewis and Mike Shannon singled sharply. Jim Coker popped up trying to bunt, but Ray Sadecki, the pitcher, lined a double right. That tied the score. Clemens promptly lined single to center for two more runs, and when Julian Javier laced a double into the leftfield corner, Casey Stengel went out to get Stallard. He waved in Jack Fisher. At 3–1, it was still a ball game but Fisher, making his Met debut, took care of that. First he made a good play, taking Groat's one‐bouncer and catching a runner off third. But then he yielded a scoring single to Bill White that put men on first and third, and committed a flagrant balk for the fifth run. After that, he pitched well. He ended the fifth with a strikeout and allowed only one single. in the next two innings. Ron Locke pitched the eighth. The three Cardinal pitchers, all regular starters, had no more trouble with the Mets than they do up North. Ernie Broglio gave four singles, two in each of the first and third innings, and Sadecki and Bob Gibson none at all in the last six innings. New York's run was the result of a walk to Amado Samuel, two bunts and a fielder's choice. Stallard's bunt was fumbled by Coker, and Hunt's sacrifice put men on second and third with one out. On a tap by Tim Harkness, White decided to throw home but a moment's hesitation enabled Samuel to slide in safely. A fine double play, started byi White and including a spectacular catch and return by Groat, ended the inning. A major improvement has been made in Al Lang Field: A dark screen has been erected in center field to provide a good background for the batters. For many years, the low fence made it difficult to see a pitched ball. This led to endless complaining, less efficient training, and sometimes serious overevaluation of pitchers. The correction was long overdue. Both the Mets and Cardinals use this bay‐front park, seating about 7,000, for their home exhibition games. When they play each other, they take turns as the home team. The Mets, as the visitors this time, took batting at their own practice field, Huggins‐Stengel Field. Then they rode the 20 blocks to Al Lang Field by bus in time to take fielding practice there. Casey Stengel was shocked when he heard that Shea Stadium was to cost;4.5 million more than previously announced. “What did they do?” he asked, “buy Frank Hotvard ?” Stan Musial, America's official caretaker of calisthenics as head of the President's Physical Fitness Program, was in uniform before the game, but in civvies when it started. “That's another first,” said Johnny Keane, the Cardinal manager. “It must seem very strange to many of these fans to see a Cardinal team training without Musial. It hasn't happened in 20 years.” METS (N.)

372-> PRICE-FIXING DENIED BY 19 BOX CONCERNS
GREENSBORO, N. C., Jan. 16 (UPI) — Nineteen major cardboard box manufacturing concerns, accused by the Justice Department of price‐fixing, filed denials of the charges in Federal court yesterday. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, in a suit filed on Oct. 14 in United States District Court here, contended that the manufacturers had violated antitrust laws by restricting price competition in eight Southeastern states. The concerns operate 56 plants in the eight‐state area. The complaint said the companies had conspired since 1955 to exchange price information, resulting in unreasonable restriction of price competition. Mr. Kennedy said the com‐ plaint had been based on dealings in the Southeastern part of the United States, but the court order would apply to all operations of the companies. In their answer the manufac‐ turers argued that a decree of 1940 allowed the practice of exchanging price listings, as long as the listings were available to the trade and competitors. Named in the suit were: Container Corporation of America, Chicago; Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company, Richmond, Va.; Carolina Container Company, High Point, N. C.; Continental Can, New York City; Crown Zellerback Company, San Francisco; Dixie Container Corporation, Richmond. Also Dixie Container Corporation of North Carolina, Morganton, N. C.; Carolina, Inland Container Corporation, Indianapolis; Internatioal Paper Compay, New York; the Mead Corporation, Dayton, Ohio; Miller Container Corporation, Roanoke, Va.; OwensIllinois Glass, Toledo, Ohio. Also St. Joe Paper Company, Jacksonville, Fla.; St. Regis Paper Company, New York; TriState Container Corporation, Elizabethton, Tenn.; Union BagCamp Paper Corporation, New York; West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company, New York; Weyerhaeuser Company, Tacoma, Wash., and the Waterbury Corrugated Container Company, Waterbury, Conn.

373-> ‘REAL PROBLEMS’
TO THE EDITOR: As a planner and a suburbanite, I was dismayed by Ada Louise Huxtable's fanciful exposition of the “sins of suburbia” (“ ‘Clusters' Instead of ‘Slurbs,’ ” Feb. 9). Rather than showing understanding of the factors that have made for the single‐family‐house boom, she exhibits a misplaced do‐good spirit which might better be directed to the real problems of “urbia.” If epithets—such as “slurbs”—are needed, may I offer “disturbia”? Why worry so much about the unlikely “slums of the future” when today's slums house millions in misery ? “ article dealt with suburban, not urban, problems. To the city slum dweller, suburbia does, indeed, seem the promised land. He seldom gets there, however, because lowincome housing is so rarely available—another of the ‘sins of suburbia.’ ”

375-> FAIRGROUNDS GET A COLLEGE RUSH; Hundreds of Students Wait in Line to Get Jobs
Hundreds of students from Southern universities waited in long lines yesterday at the Brass Rail's employment center to receive their World's Fair assignments. The scene resembled a college registration period. The students had been previously hired by the company, which canvassed 670 colleges throughout the nation for 4,000 students. They will earn $60 a week, plus two meals, for rotating in jobs at refreshment stands, working as cashiers and selling souvenirs at more than 30 “refreshment centers.” They will receive no tips. The students who arrived yesterday attend colleges on a trimester system. Their summer vacations began last Friday, and will end in early August. A student contingent from Midwestern schools is expected in early May. For some, it was the first trip north. Alice Schweyer, 19 years old, a well‐tanned blonde from the University of Florida, said that she looked forward to “being on my own, managing my money and myself, and living in a completely different environment—up North with all you Yankees.” Lynne Haubenreich, ‐19, of the University of Tennessee, has temporary quarters at Tatham House, a Young Women's Christian Association residence in Murray Hill. She will begin apartment hunting today. James Vignola, 21, a senior at Miami Dade Junior College, said that he was eager to meet people from all over the world. “We all know what de Gaulle and Lord Home have to say,” he said. “I want to see what the people from their countries have to say.” Another case of pilferage came to light yesterday. The Philippines Pavilion said that a $500 generator had been stolen. Thieves also made off with wood carvings and artificial plants, according to Frank L. Provino, supervisor of construction. Philippine detectives were called in recently to guard against future thefts. The Helldriver Auto Thrill Show reported that vandals had ripped a door off its hinges, torn up sod, and broken open a manhole. There were no thefts, however, according to Ed Koso, architectural superintendent. The Unisphere was formally presented to the World's Fair yesterday by Roger M. Blough, board chairman of the United States Steel Corporation. The stainless steel sculpture, which cost about $2 million, is 140 feet tall—as high as a 12story building. It weighs 940,000 pounds and performs “a balancing act that defies time,” Mr. Blouah said. Robert Moses, the fair's president, accepted the Unisphere and noted: “Everything of significance in this vale of tears provokes controversy if it's any good. We all have to live through the yapping of critics.” He added that the fair would open on time “in spite of the detractors.” Mr. Blough and Mr. Moses then pushed the button that turned on the fountain of the continents. Spectators left the blue and white canvas tent to avoid getting sprayed by the 10‐foot‐tall fountains, which will uitimately reach a height of 40 feet.

376-> Youths in Economy Run Learn ‘Featherfooting’
TWENTY top teen‐agers from across the nation have learned to live a highway motto they'd recommend to any young driver: Keep Smooth, Keep Safe. The 11 boys and nine girls started driving Chevrolet's nine entries in the 1964 Mobil Economy Run on Friday and have discovered that economy driving and safety go hand in hand. In a month of special schooling by Chevrolet engineers and test drivers in Arcadia, a suburb of Los Angeles, the teenagers have become skilled “featherfooters” to compete against the adult veteran drivers in the first use of all‐teenage crews in the 28‐year history of the cross‐country event. With “featherfooting” — the use of a light, smooth accelerator foot to make a drop of gasoline stretch as far as possible—they have ble nded the patience, judgment and planning needed to become good economy drivers. And though the word “safety” is seldom spoken, the teenagers proved to themselves the importance of careful driving in such outdoor “classrooms” as the famed Los Angeles free‐ ways, sticky rush‐hour traffic and steep roads in the nearby Sierra Madres. “My attitude on driving has changed considerably since joining this group,” said David Pease, 19 years old, of Kansas City. “Hot‐rodding on highways had a certain glamour but now it seems foolish and totally worthless.” Several of the young people admit to having had “a heavy foot” before beginning their training. But their instructors showed them during the practice that extra speed doesn't actually save time in traffic. “The person who charges up to lights and doesn't drive smoothly is taking all the chances while you get there just as fast as he does,” said Larry Booth, 19, of Birmingham, Ala. Highway navigation, auto mechanics and traffic fundamentals were some of the classroom subjects of the special schooI. But the majority of time was spent in supervised driving. The “Teen Team” had nearly 7,000 miles of practice driving when it began the run to the World's Fair here. The boy‐girl teams were assigned for the run on the basis of their driving and navigation skills shown in the first week. The youngsters expressed concern about the image of many of today's teen‐age drivers after a police safety expert told them that about 10 per cent of teen‐age drivers give their fellow young people a bad traffic reputation. “This has changed my whole concept of driving,” said Earl Reed, 19, of Boston. “Teenagers should realize that smoothness and safeness in driving will keep them alive longer.” “Teen‐agers perhaps depend too much on the fact that their reflexes are so sharp,” said Marc Newman, 18, of Chicago. “Relying too much on these reflexes, they take dangerous chances by getting into tight traffic situations.” The youngsters have among their competitors a man who is old enough to be their father—Herman (Hy) Plotkin. The 44year‐old New York taxicab driver is competing in the run with a new Dodge, the same kind of car he drives 12 hours a day in New York City.

377-> Spingarn—Bluestein
The marriage of Miss Carole Bluestein, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Leonard Bluestein of Monsey, N. Y., to John H. Spingarn took place here yesterday afternoon. Rabbi Martin J. Zion performed the ceremony at the home of Dr. and Mrs. Clifford L. Spingarn, parents of the bridegroom, at 35 East 85th Street, in the presence of members of the immediate families. The couple graduated from the University College of Arts and Science of New York University. Mrs. Spingarn is a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley. Her husband attended the N.Y.U. Graduate School.

378-> Recreation Program, Unites Mothers
MOTHERS, in general, are a determined lot where the well‐being of their young is concerned. And some are more determined than others. That this is so is currently gbeing demonstrated by the Sloomingdale Neighborhood Recreation Committee, a group of mothers who have Joined together in a volunteer preschool play program at 885 Columbus Avenue, for youngsters 2 to 5 years old. The group is an outgrowth of the Bloomingdale Conservation Project, a city neighborhood improvement program, which originally set up a free, family‐centered play group in quarters provided by the Children's Aid Society. When this aspect of the program was discontinued last year, neighborhood mothers thought enough of it to try to continue it on their own. They knocked on endless doors and their tireless enthusiasm eventually won them the necessary “go‐ahead” from the Children's Aid Society and the Health Department. The play group started on Nov. 9 with 50 families registered. Mothers run the entire operation from the setting up of equipment to teaching (done by 12 trained volunteers), supervising play, dispensing refreshments and talking over family concerns. Anyone in the neighborhood who wishes to join the recreation committee may do so by paying 25 cents. Children are divided into age groups and meet on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 9:30 to 11:30 A.M. The Bloomingdale area runs roughly from West 96th Street to West 104th and from Amsterdam Avenue to Riverside Drive. “We set the 25‐cent fee deliberately so that everyone taking part would do so on an equal basis,” Mrs. Shirley Sarnoff, chairman of the group, explained. “So far, community contributions have kept us afloat.” To children penned in city apartments by winter weather, the program is a delight. It is hardly less so to their mothers. “It gives us a chance for adult company, a break in the week's routine, and we are coming. to know one another as neighbors should,” Mrs. Sarnoff said. “While everyone else is wondering how all. of the different backgrounds represented in the city will ever find common ground, we're doing it. After all, we have our children's future at heart.” The recreation committee plans to move out‐of‐doors with good weather. “With the help of the city's Department of Parks, we are planning to broaden our summer program to include youngsters through teenagers,” Mrs. Helen Clarke, vice chairman, said.

379-> EDUCATION FEDERAL SCHOOL AID ; Localities With Own Improvement Plans Seen Getting Priority
Presideent Johnson's $1 billion programm of war against poverty assigns aakeyrole to education. It is a role which has been in the talking stage since before the late President Kennedy's inauguration, but has assumed new importance as a result of the pressures by civil rights leaders in the Northern cities where the battle for better educational opportunities in the slum schools has become education's first priority. Although the educational provisions of the Johnson proposals remain vague and, in thepresident's own word,’ “flexible ” certain broad outlines emerge. Mositimmportant among thehints of the future is thhe President's stress on the importance of local ideas and efforts and the need’ for new, rather than traditional, approaches. This puts considerable responsibility on “the shoulders of the national, and especially the urban, educational leader ‘hip. It will probably mean that those local school superintendents and college presidents who come up with their own plans into which Federal dollars can fit, without danger of waste, may get ahead of the parade. In other words, there is to be an element of national competition in the program, probably because the President and his advisers—particularly United States Commissioner of Education Francis Keppel—distrust the routine ap- proach which has been so dismal a failure in the big city slums. Fortunately, American school leaders have a number of examples of past proposals and actions, here and elsewhere, which may help them on their way. Task Force Report The broadest hint was contained in the original Task Force report drawn up at the request of President Kennedy by a group of distinguished educators, including Mr. Keppel, then dean of Harvard's Graduate School of Education. It called for a special fund of Federal aid for distressed areas, particularly the city slums. Such money was seen as an essential ingredient for any large‐scale experimentation aimed at providing for slum children the kind of education which substitutes many of the items which are offered to middle‐class children at home. In New York City the original Higher Horizons program achieved something of this nature. It offered children from underprivileged homes not only improved instruction in school, with greater personal attention by good teachers, but also arranged cultural opportunities, such as visits to concerts, operas and theaters, for them. Linked with a similar program in the high schools, the experiment was at first startlingly successful. It gave youngsters a meaningful lease on life, with all the aspirations of more economically fortunate children. One of the pitfalls of such a program is that, once it is proved successful, it must be applied to greater numbers of children. When this happens—as it did in New York—the school systemmust spread the funds and the special staffs too thin. In the end, as a result of watering down, the original gains are lost and only the label and the publicity value remain emain. This is why, with the success of specific pilot programs already shown, substantial and continuing Federal funds are of vital importance. In a completely different area, the President spoke of the need forr programs which combine job training and education. This goes to the heart of the reason why so many past attempts at preventing school drop‐outs’ have failed. They often have, in the words of the San Francisco Superintenddent of Schools Harold Spears, merely brought youngsters back into school without sufficient thought about the kind of program of education that is relevant to their needs. The Same Things Even so‐called remedial programs tend to do the same things after school—often with the same teachers—which failed to do any good during school hours. Here again educators may look to precedents which have been given too little attention in the past because they departed from the organizational routine. They should not, of course, be blindly ’ immitated, where new situations call for new ideas, but they ought to offer some guidelines. For example, cooperative education has been applied on the college level, and in some cities (including New York) even in high school, with marked success. Under such programs, pupils study and work, and their work may range from simple jobs in industry or business to highly complicated and advanced scientific occupations. Northeastern University, in Boston, one of the leaders in the cooperative education movement, has opened up such highly professional fields as graduate mathematics studies to the cooperative approach. Built‐In In many European countries, and most prominently in the Soviet Union, after‐work “continuation schools” have been built into the regular scheme of public education. The Scandinavian countries have long established a tradition of the so‐called Folk High Schools and People's Colleges—residential campuses on which the children of workers and farmers combine vocational study with liberal education. One important hint, at least by strong implication, given by President Johnson to American educators is that they must free their profession from narrow, certification‐minded confinement. Instead of pretending that traditionally trained teachers can do the new and unconventional job alone, they will have to welcome volunteers with a wide variety of backgrounds. One of the important by‐products of such a partnership might be the evolution of new approaches to professional teacher training in the future. Finally, there are already blueprints in some communities which, with the impetus of Federal aid, could be quickly translated into action programs. New York's Superintendent of Schools Dr. Calvin E. Gross has been talking about a “saturation program” for the slum schools. There is a good chance that any city which, with the Johnson program in the offing, gets its own show on the road, might not only be eligible for funds more quickly but could become a proving ground of new ideas for the national effort.

380-> New Law to Affect Estimates of Tax On 1964's Income
Relatively few taxpayers will concern themselves with the $11.5 billion tax reduction bill when they sit down to hone their rusty arithmetic skills on the Federal tax form between now and April 15. Those who must keep the bill in mind are the six million high‐income taxpayers who each quarter must pay either because they are not subject to payroll withholding or because the tax withheld by their employers is not sufficient to keep them up to date under the pay‐as‐you‐go rules. The rest of the taxpayers will be filing reports on 1963 income since the tax bill effects 1964 income and not that of 1963. The old tables and old rules wili be in effect for those taxpayers. To help the six million with their estimates under the as yet ill‐defined rules affecting 1964 income, the Internal Revenue Service is distributing 15 million single‐page instruction sheets to banks, post offices and other public locations in addition to local revenue offices. The instructions are sketchy. Even the Internal Revenue Service is somewhat in the dark over the new rules. The agency says that taxpayers who file quarterly declarations should use the forms in the 1964 tax packets sent out earlier or that they should obtain declaration forms when they pick up their instruction sheets. Quarterly tax payments are required by law from individuals whose annual income from sources other than wages and salaries exceeds $200. The quarterly payments are also required from those who earn $5,000 a year or more — $10,000 in the case of a married couple — and whose tax liabilities exceed their withheld taxes by $40 or more. A safe technique for those with fairly constant incomes is to use last year's income as the basis for estimating. Then the 1964 tax table can be used to find the year's tax on that amount of earnings. The taxpayer should then pay by April 15 one‐quarter of the tax shown less 18 per cent of the first quarter's income subject to withholding since this part of his tax has already been paid. If the taxpayer's 1964 income is considerably at variance with his 1963 income at his current rate of earnings, he should try to estimate his first quarter's tax by using his actual earnings as best he can figure them. The 1964 tax table taken in conjunction with the technique just outlined should keep him within a safe level. If the tax paid does fall somewhat behind there will be no penalty as long as the taxpayer's rate of payment stays within 70 per cent of the tax accruing. Taxpayers whose income is mostly from nonwithholding sources such as dividends, interest, stock transactions and the like should be able to reduce 1963 tax estimates by 15 per cent if the income for both years will be about equal. However, if dividend income is the major factor in total income, the expected quarter's tax should be reduced by only 2 per cent of dividend income rather than the 4 per cent used in 1963.

382-> Recession Perils Regime
ROME, March 14—Pressures on Premier Aldo Moro's 100day‐old Center‐Left Government have increased in the last few days and internal strains have become visible. The regime was Under stress today because an industrial recession and possibly major unemployment seemed to loom as a consequence of its austerity program to fight inflation. Organized labor and big business attacked the Government for having smothered the “Italian miracle” of prosperity. Quarrels broke out in Mr. four‐party Cabinet. The Under Secretary of State Holdings, Carlo Donat Cattin, a member of the Premier's Christian Democratic party, received, a public rebuke from coalition leaders for having openly criticized Finance Minister Roberto Tremelloni, a Socialist. However, a leading member of the Government, Foreign Minister Giuseppe Saragat, warned in a statement that there was no “really democratic alternative” to the present Center‐Left regime, implying that its collapse would damage democracy in Italy. Even new elections, the Foreign Minister said, would not provide a solution because the strength of the various parties would remain almost unchanged. The minister said that the present economic crisis could be mastered by the Government and emphasized that Italy's alies had full confidence in this country's future. Mr. Saragat is the head of the Italian Social Democratic party and a stanch advocate of Italy's collaboration with the West. In addition to his and the premier's parties, the Government is supported by Deputy Premier Pietro Nenni's Italian Socialist party and the small, moderately leftist Republicans. The Government began an austerity plan three weeks ago to curb consumer spending. The deflationary measures included a new auto sales tax, a surtax on gasoline and tightened rules for installment‐plan buying. The measurescaused a sharp slump in auto and appliance sales, with repercussions above all in northern Italy's industrial triangle — Turin, Genoa and Milan.

383-> Youthful Stylists Finding Success In Custom Work
THE little dressmaker and the custom salon may be vanishing institutions, but there still are outcroppings of small shops that make clothes to order. Often the designers help support the custom operation by making a wholesale collection that is sold to shops in other areas. Some young designers prefer custom work because it gives them an opportunity to design for individuals rather than for an anonymous mass of women. They feel they benefit from direct contact with the consumer. Often, they have a special viewpoint about clothes and attract a circle of customers who have a similar attitude. Other customers who generally buy their clothes ready‐made wiil occasionally want something spectacular for a special event, such as a wedding, and come to a custom shop. One of the most talented of the young designers is Nilo, a tousled‐haired young man whose clothes have a lean and swingy look, and who has developed a following of well‐bred young women since he showed his first collection last fall. His spring styles were presented at a series of informal cocktail parties crowded with teen‐agers carrying their books in chic, quilted tote bags while their mothers in furs or tweeds nodded approvingly. Comfortable Setting The models, carrying identifying cards, strolled through the comfortable setting that looked like a living room, which it is. Nilo lives and works on the ground floor of a brownstone house at 331 East 65th Street with a greenhouse at the back. Customers are encouraged to have a cup of tea as they inspect the clothes. Born Neil William de Paul 30 years ago, Nilo entered the fashion world through theatrical portals. A singer and actor, he was a leprechaun in “Finian's Rainbow” and played three of the sons in “Life With Father” during his theatrical career, which started at the age of 16 and was interrupted by a bout of hepatitis. Invited to do the costumes for “Nightcap,” an Off‐Broadway revue by Jerry Herman, a former college roommate, he found he had an affinity for the sewing machine. He did 36 costumes; including a suit, he recalled recently. “I had a flair, but I knew nothing about construction,” he said. After doing costumes for another show, “Single Man at a Party,” he opened the first of a series of dress shops in Greenwich Village, during which he concentrated on the serious business of learning to cut, sew and grade patterns on a professional level. His instructors were people he employed to make the clothes he designed. he said. Today, he has acquired sufficient skill to execute the simple, pure designs that appeal to knowledgeable customers. He believes that good clothes are “a background for good jewelry,” and that a woman need not spend a fortune on her wardrobe. Prices start at $125 for day dresses. He likes practical touches like an extra silk skirt to match the blouse that accompanies a wool suit so that a customer can wear the blouse with the skirt for an extra outfit. For the fall, he is planning a wholesale collection that will be designed here and made in Paris. When Sally Merz, the public relations director for Huntington Hartford's Gallery of Modern Art, needed a wardrobe of evening dresses for the week of previews that preceded the museum's official opening, Salvador Dall advised her to see Flynn. Flynn turned out to be one of the few Negroes who have made a successful breakthrough in the fashion field. Only 20 years old, and still attending the Traphagen School of Fashion, he is a designer employed by Adele Ross in her custom shop at 14 East 56th Street. Mrs. Merz was so impressed by his work that she bought three gowns, a pink mohair suit and a black afternoon dress. She was back the other afternoon to order another dress. The walls of the shop are peppered with the sketches of Flynn Edwards (he prefers to use his first name), who will also work out a special design for a customer who has her own ideas about what she wants. Hired as Sketcher Soon after he came to New York from Philadelphia three years ago to attend school here, he passed Miss Ross's shop on his way to Bloomingdale's, went in and introduced himself. She hired him as a sketcher two days a week. Today he works full time and goes to school at night. He hopes to complete his course in June. The shop specializes in evening clothes in fabrics collected from all over the world. A basic coat shape, with two pockets on the chest and an Empire waistline, is as good in mohair for day as it is in chiffon and lace for evening. Prices start at $150 at the shop. Thom Parker, a bearded young man who had worked as a designer on Seventh Avenue, joined a friend, Richard Keith, three years ago to open a combination beauty salon and custom dress shop. At R. Keith, 18 West 56th Street, a woman can have her hair done in one part of the room and then walk across the floor to have a dress fitting. Occasionally, a mannequin will parade through the salon to show the clothes to the women under the dryers. Mr. Parker finds that the majority of his clients want a gown for a special occasion. A long‐torso Empire dress in pastel chiffon with a coat to match in lace is a favorite for the mother of the bride. A pretty, short evening dress is in black chiffon with a bloused bodice and snug band across the hips. A basic daytime sheath is in wool with V‐shaped seaming at front. Prices start at $185 and are 10 per cent higher for sizes 16 and 18.

384-> Record 6‐8 Jump Made by McClellon
Bill McClellon soared to new heights yesterday. The precocious 16‐year‐old DeWitt Clinton sophomore capped his first indoor track and field season with a high jump of 6 feet 8 inches to set a national schoIastic indoor record for the second time in two months. McClellon's performance highlighted the 60th annual Public Schools Athletic League championships at the 102d Engineers Armory. Another 16‐year‐old—Orlando Martinez of Alexander Hamilton—also stood out by breaking the meet record in the mile. The newly crowned national schoolboy mile champion lowered the long standing meet record of 4 minutes 27.8 seconds with a time of 4:24. Andrew Jackson of Queens, Without an individual winner on the 13‐event' program, captured the team trophy with 29 points. Boys High of Brooklyn, the team victor the last two years, was second with 16 points, It was Jackson's first victory in the meet since 1960. McClellon, who had started the campaign as a novice, gave a flawless exhibition of high jumping. He began jumping at 5‐8 and went through 11 jumps (an inch at a time) without a miss. He missed for the first time at 6‐8 but came right back and cleared the height by an inch. The bar was then moved up to 6‐9, and for the first time McClellon appeared to . be straining. But at this height, even the best of college and club jumpers start straining. He didn't come close on three attempts. The 6‐8 feat put into discard the national record of. 6‐73/4 the Harlem youth set in the Hayes Games Jan. 18 at the same armory. The previous mark had been 6‐71/2 set by John Thomas as a schoolboy in 1958. Thomas wore spikes on his jump; in both of his national record efforts. McClellon wore flat shoes. The 5‐foot‐11‐inch 146‐pound youth won seven straight meets this season and cleared 6-7 in five of the victories. He was tied on two occasions. He deadlocked with four others at 6‐51/4 in the St.Fancis Prep Games and shared the national title with Carl Dawkins of Somerville, Mass., last week at Madison Square Garden at 6‐7. The Garden meet was the only one in which McClellon used spikes. The height was said to be a record for the 102d Engineers Armory, where club, college and high school athletes have competed regularly since World War II. The previous record at the:armory was believed to have been 6‐7 7/8 by Irving Mondschein of New York University in the 1947 metropolitan intercollegiates. After he had finished, McClellon said he was “perfectly relaxed today.” He looked it His competition ceased at 6‐2 and he methodically and cleanly cleared each inch thereafter until 6‐8 and then 6‐9 The youngster, with a gri n as wide as the Hudson Riyer, said that he had jumped between gun shots. Track events were in progress while McClellon was jumping and he admitted that the bark of the starter's gun had bothered him in previous meets. He said he was more comfortable in flat shoes than spikes and that he expected to do even better when he jumped outdoors. He believes he can do “6‐9 or better” outdoors. Martinez, a senior, was first place from start to finish in the mile run and won by 65 yards, It was his fourth victory of the season including thenational championship, in which. hedid 4:174, the second‐best time in the history of that fixture. The 6‐foot 158‐pound Brooklyn runner was upset in this meet last year and then went on to win the P.S.A.L.outdoor crown. Yesterday his 1963 conquerer, Mike Johnson of Boys High, finished sixth. A meet record fell to another Alexander Hamilton represent ative. Mike Wallace won by 7 yards from Ron Lee of Franklin in the 1,000‐yard run in 2:17.3. Lee, with a 2:18.4, also was under the previous mark of 2:19.5 set by Lionel Russell of Boys last lear. The fourth record of tte meet went to a speedy Boys' The team of Cecil Davis, Clec quartet in the 880‐yard relay. Hatcher, Bill Miller and Sylvester Robinson was clocked in 880 relay ever run by aschool‐, 1:32.3. It was the third‐fastest boy foursome. The successive 220 times for the Boysteam was i:23.7, 0:23,4,0:22.9 and 022.3. Alfonzo Grimes of Bayside repeated his triurmph last yearin the 440‐yard run. Running by himself from the start, Grimes finished in 0:50.5, a half‐second slower than the meet record. Don Knox of Adams, who finished second in the nationals last week in 9:17,the best ever for a metropolitan area schoolboy, won the two‐mile run decisively in 9:37. This was a new event and thus Knox's time will be listed as the meet record next year. Silveraa Grent, a Lane junior, took the 100‐yarddash by 2 yards in 0:10.1, and John Carios gained the 220‐yard dash title with a 0:22.6 performance, three‐tenths slower than the record.

388-> UNLISTED STOCKS ROSE LAST WEEK; Increased Buying by Public and Institutions Noted
The over‐the‐counter market continued to move forward last week in active trading. Dealers reported that prices of most issues advanced on increased buying by the public and especially institutions—trusts and pension funds. Interest by the institutions was centered mainly on the quality issues and was accomplished in big blocks of stock. The small investor was said to be mainly bargain hunting or loolking for issues that were slated to move soon to the New York or American Stock Exchanges. In the last few weeks many investors seem to believe they have found a quick way to make money—buy stocks about to be listed on an exchange and just watch the price rise. Up to now this has mainly happened. But one trader pointed out: “Just think back to two and three years ago. Everyone was space‐age and electronics happy and then the bubble burst.” Kendall Rises Among the better performers were Kendall Refining, up 3: Leaseway Transportation. ahead 4: Pacific Southwest Airlines, up 2: United Nuclear, up 1 / , and Marsh McLennan, the insurance brokerage firm up a point after reporting higher earnings for the first 11 months of last year.

390-> ELIZABETH CONKEY, CHICAGO OFFICIAL, 80
CHICAGO, Dec. 31 — Mrs. Elizabeth A. Conkey, Democratic National Committeewoman and Cook County Commissioner, died in her home today. She was 80 years old. Her husband, Charles, a Great Lakes shipping captain, died in 1937. Mrs. Conkey was the second county board member to die Within the last 24 hours. Commissioner Christ Jensen died yesterday in Kenosha, Wis., where he had a summer home. Mrs. Conkey had been a Committeewoman since 1923, and served five times as hostess to the party's national convention in Chicago. In 1931 Mrs. Conkey was the first woman appointed Jury Commissioner here. The follow‐ ing year, she was named Commissioner of Public Welfare for the city, and held that position until her election to the county board in 1934. The committeewoman, who attended the University of Chicago and Northwestern University, entered politics soon after women were granted suffrage. In 1943 Mrs. Conkey was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a member of the United States Delegation for the Organization of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

391-> SCHENLEY ALTERS WQXR LIQUOR AD; One‐Minute Announcement Will Be Nonalcoholic
Schenley Industries, Inc., which had planned to present whisky commercials on radio station WQXR, decided yesterday to make its announcements strictly nonalcoholic, except for a mention of its corporate name. Instead of advertising a certain brand of whisky, the oneminute announcements will call attention to museums, concerts and other cultural activities in the metropolitan area. The ending of each message will say that the information has been presented “as a public service by Schenley Industries and its dealers.” Schenley, one of the country's major distillers, is the second whisky advertiser to change its plans about presenting liquor commercials on radio. On April 1 McKesson & Robbins, Inc., a liquor importer, announced it had decided not to advertise scotch whisky on WQXR. It acted soon afterthe introduction in Congress of a proposal that would ban the advertising of hard liquor on radio and television. Last month Schenley and McKesson & Robbins responded to a decision by WQXR, owned by The New York Times, to accept whisky commercials after 10:30 P.M. any evening except Sunday. The station made the step despite the protest of the Distilled Spirits Institute, which had appealed to the station not to accept liquor advertising. Schenley and McKesson & Robbins are not members of the institute. The new policy of WQXR was strongly opposed also by the National Association of Broadcasters, which said the policy could provide more ammunition for “dry” forces. Under the N.A.B.'s radio and television code, the advertising of hard liquor is not acceptable. WQXR is a member of the N.A.B. but does not subscribe to the trade organization's voluntary code. WQXR's decision to accept the advertising stimulated a controversy throughout the broadcasting industry. Most stations have a policy of not presenting liquor co mmercials. On March 25 a bill was introduced in the Senate that would prohibit the advertising of “distilled spirits,” which means anything other than wine and beer, on radio and television. The stations and advertisers would be subject to penalties. The bill was introduced by Senators John O. Pastore of Rhode Island and Warren G. Magnuson of Washington, both Democrats. A few days later McKesson & Robbins announced it had withdrawn its contract with WQXR. It said it did not want “to encourage any added restrictive legislation in an industry that is burdened by controls.” At that time Shenley said it would begin its whisky commercials as scheduled on April 6. Later, however, the company said it had encountered a “copy problem” and would delay the start of its commercials for two weeks until April 20. Yesterday Schenley would not explain why it had decided not to advertise whisky on WQXR. But observers in the liquor and broadcasting industries believed it must be because of the threat of restrictive legislation by Congress. Schenley said only that it would maintain its 13‐week commitment with WQXR to sponsor a program of good music from 11:30 to midnight, Mondays through Fridays. A spokesman said the initial commercial on Monday evening would be a “eulogistic description” of the Cloisters, the museum in Fort Tryon Park. Other announcements that evening will deal with the World's Fair, including information about how to get there, and forthcoming concerts at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center. Schenley Industries will be mentioned only once in each announcement.

IN a country of fantastic wealth and wretched poverty, of visionary faith and religious persecution, Spanish painting produced comparatively few of the world's greatest masters but these, Marking in relative isolation, developed personal idioms to become giants whose stature not only holds but increases. In the Spanish pavilion at the World's Pair, five masters—El Greco in the late 16th century, Zurbaran, Ribera and Velas‐quez in the .17th, and Goya in the late 18th and early I9th—are shown here. All but Ribera influenced the art movements of the last hundred years, including the work of the modern Spanish painters also exhibited; paintings by two of them, Miro and Picasso, are at left.

394-> ASSEMBLY BACKS TRACK REBUILDING; Continuation of Extra 1 Per Cent of Mutuel Cut Passed
ALBANY, Feb. 24 — The State Assembly made a multimillion‐dollar bet today on the future of thoroughbred horse racing. It approved a bill to continue for 14 years the extra 1 per cent cut in the pari‐mutuel betting pool that the New York Racing Association has been receiving since 1957. The lower house endorsed the extension by a vote of 100‐32. Those arguing against the bill said it would deprive the state of needed revenue. The purpose of the measure, which now goes to the Senate for concurrence, is to provide the racing association, a nonprofit organization, with the wherewithal to rebuild the grandstands at Belmont Park and to make improvements in the facilities at the Saratoga, N. Y., track. The Belmont stands were declared unsafe in 1963 and have since been demolished. All flat racing in the downstate area was conducted last year at Aqueduct. At the 1963 level of betting, the additional 1 per cent share in the betting pool would amount to $87.3 million by the time it expired Dec. 31, 1979. If the popularity of racing continues to increase at the pace of the last decade, however, the bill could produce much more than that for the association. The 1 per cent last year was worth $6,238,000. The New York Racing Association received a franchise from the state in 1955 to operate the downstate tracks and the Saratoga track. At that time, the association's share of the 15 per cent cut in the betting pool was 4 per cent at the downstate tracks and 5 per cent at Saratoga. Two years later, the association's share was increased by 1 per cent, to be effective until the end of 1965. This additional share provides the means for the modernization of Aqueduct. Governor Rockefeller urged support to the current bill in his budget message last month. In support of the legislation, the racing association argued tha t it was unwise for the state to have all its eggs in one basket. Aqueduct produced 96 per cent of the $67 million in state revenue from flat tracks last year. Fire, a major accident or other disasters are ever‐present hazards that could put the Big A out of operation, with a daily tax loss to the state of $300,000, an association memorandum said. Declaring that Belmont should be re‐opened at the earliest possible time, the association said: “In the first half of 1963, the prolonged use of the racing strip at Aqueduct hardened the base of the track with the result that an unusually large number of horses broke down. This contributed to fewer entries by the horsemen and a resultant loss of pari‐mutuel revenue.”

396-> Clay and Liston Slug It Out in TV Battle of Barbs; Yond Cassius Shows Speed, but His Foe's Blows Pack Power
Cassius Clay (“I'm the greatest thing in all history”) and Sonny Liston (“I imagine he'll be talking as he's going down”) sparred verbally yesterday over closed‐circuit television. Clay was faster, but Liston threw the harder punches. “If you whup me,” said Clay to Liston, “I'll crawl across the ring and kiss your feet.” Said Liston to Clay, “I ain't gonna wait around all night until you're able to crawl.” The exchange took place during a news conference arranged by Theatre Network Television, Inc., the company that will produce the closed‐circuit television showing of the Clay‐Liston heavyweight title fight at Miami Beach Feb. 25. Liston and Clay were speaking from their Florida training sites. They were able to see each other via TV monitors but not the newsmen questioning them from TNT's technical center in Woodside, Queens. TNT's Eidophor projector cast an image of motion‐picture clarity for the news conference, the first of its kind in sports. Clay and Liston cast images, too. The 50‐minute show opened with Clay backpedaling from Cody Jones, a sparring partner, in Miami's Fifth Street Gym, and switched to the Surfside Auditorium where Liston was inflicting damage on a heavy bag. The cameras returned to Clay, sitting in the middle of the ring, wrapped in a terrycloth robe, drinking from a container of orange juice. Cassius didn't wait to be questioned. “You just saw that big bear. Is he as rangy and pretty and fast as me?” he asked. He was not impressed that Liston was hitting the bag hard, and began running off at the mouth when somebody suggested that he ran off at the mouth because his confidence was shaky. “I'm getting wilder every day,” he said. “I can knock a man out backing up. . . . I'm gonna upset the whole world. . . . Hey, what camera am I on ?” The 22‐year‐old boy with the mouth of a river flowed on: About Liston (“He talks too much, I don't like people who talk too much”). About his status as underdog in the fight (“At these odds I'm a poor man's dream”). About the Liston‐Floyd Patterson fights (“They were rabbit hunts”) . About his strategy for the fight (“To hit and not be hit”). Cassius, mugging and pouty, looked like a teen‐aged idol caught without his fan club. The cameras turned to Liston, whose eyes sparkle with humor although his lips are set. “Y'know, when you have kids and they don't mind you, you have to put them in their place,” he said. “He has to keep talking, but what'll happen to him when all those people leave him and he has to come to me? Liston does not run off at the mouth; his wit is dry. When he was asked if he expected Clay to slug or run away, his lips twitched and he said, “I expect him to jump out of the ring.” When he was asked how his supposedly ailing knee was, he said, “I went to a witch doctor who told me to let nature take its course.” After a while, Clay and Liston began talking to each other. Sonny accepted Clay's challenge to a winner‐take‐all‐the‐purse fight and offered him half his share just for showing up. Sonny also suggested that Clay mind his own business, “which he has none of.” “People love you, Charles,” said Clay. “I make you great. The fans love you because I'm the villain.” Liston smiled, which is like the sun breaking through an overcast sky. “I appreciate what you're doing for me,” he said. During the kissing‐feet exchange, Liston said he would kiss Clay's feet if the challenger lasted three rounds. “I trapped you,” crowed Clay. “No, I trapped you,” said Liston. “Got you to sign a contract to fight me.” Liston said he would not damage Clay's pretty face. Joe Louis, in Sonny's camp, outlined Cassius's only two strategic possibilities as follows: “One, he should stay away from Liston. Second best, he should stay away as long as possible.”

399-> Palmer Problem:Head Goes toHis Golf
AUGUSTA, Ga., April 10 (AP)—It's not driving, approaching or putting that is bothering Arnold Palmer most in his bid for a fourth Masters golf championship. It's his headgear. “I just don't seem able to get the right kind of hat,” Palmer said today. “If I like a hat, Winni vetoes it. Then I'll decide against one that she recommends. “People are always coming up to me and saying I should wear this kind of hat or that. Most people want me to go bareheaded.” Since the beginning of the week Palmer has tried out four different styles of headgear—almost like a woman selecting an Easter bonnet. “I've always played without a hat,” Arnie said. “But I'm having trouble with my skin—nay be from stopping smoking. Also, I think it's better if I have a shade’ when I'm putting.” At the first of the week, Palmer donned a beige “pork pie,” the kind many golfers wear, and one his company makes. “That has to go,” said Winnie, Arnold's pretty brunette wife. “You look dreadful.” Palmer acquiesced. He tried a white British cap with a full crown. Spectators didn't even recognize him on the putting green. They had grown accustomed to his strong, brown face, his rounded features and receding hairline. The British cap wouldn't do. “It made him look like a thug,” Winnie aid, putting her foot down. In the first round yesterday, Palmer made a third shift—this time to a regular golfer's cap that was white and had a long brim. “I don't like it at all,” Winnie said. “It made him look balloonheaded. I told him so.” Arnold didn't want to look balloon‐headed. Palmer showed up today in a white visor, or eyeshade, the kind Helen Wills used to wear on the tennis court. “That was my idea,” Winnie said. “I got tired of seeing Arnie in all those terrible hats. He wore a visor when I first met him. I liked the way his dark, curly hair came out over the band. “I think this is the answer.” Arnold looked at himself in the locker‐room mirror. “I don't know,” he said. “Maybe I'll just throw away the works and not wear a hat at all. To heck with the sun.”

ATLANTA, Jan. 31 (UPI) —A municipal judge today disissed as totally unfounded charges that Negro trusties had molested female civil rights workers jailed in a wave of protest demonstrations. Demonstrators said earlier testimony they had to build a barricade of steel cots in the Atlanta jail to protect the women and girls from advances of the trusties. Several women said they were fondled by the trusties. After a hearing, Judge T. C. Little said: “I dismiss the charges against these defendants as being totally unfounded. No one could identify anyone that placed their hands on them after swearing yesterday that they could.”

401-> Havana Denies Reports Of Castro Assassination
A rumor, apparently without foundation, that Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba had been assassinated swept through Miami, Washington and New York yesterday. Reached by telephone in Havana, Celia Sanchez, Secretary to the Presidency and the Cabinet of Ministers, said that the report was not true and the city was “very quiet.” She could think of no occurrence that would have given rise to the rumor. Other official sources in Havana said there was no basis for the rumor. An investigation by The Associated Press traced the report to a Cuban refugee in Miami. The New York Times first heard the report from an anonymous telephone caller. Editors were later queried as to its accuracy by a Government agency in Washington.

CAPETOWN, Feb. 6 (Reuters)The South African Government has refused to admit a group appointed by the United Nations to study the racial situation in this country, it was disclosed today. In a reply to the Secretary General, U Thant, sent through the South African representative at the United Nations, the Government said it was “manifestly impossible” to receive the group. It said that the proposed visit was not only “specifically intended as interference in the internal affairs” of South Africa but that the group was also expected to “prescribe how the Republic should be governed and, by implication, even what should be the provisions of its constitution.” The South African reply, sent to the United Nations yesterday, said the group consisted of persons who, “however estimable they may be in other respects, have no firsthand knowledge of the situation in South Africa.”

405-> SOPRANO OFFERS A SONG PROGRAM; Miss de los Angeles Gives a Recital at Carnegie Hall
The voice and art of Victoria de los Angeles grow more distilled with the passage of time. They have become so refined that a full realization of their quality comes only as they are separated from everything else. On Saturday night, standing alone on the stage of Carnegie Hall, the soprano sang a Spanish song without instrumental intrusion. The exquisite voice, spinning out a convoluting melody with the most delicate gradations in tone, provided about as beautiful a sound as the human ear could experiPncP. But accompanied or unaccompanied, Miss de los Angeles's was always superlative in this recital. Nor was it always so otherworldly. In Brahms's “Liebestreu” the voice took on the heavy emotion of grief. In “Clavelitos” the music and text sparkled with mischief. In Montsalvatge's “Cancion de cuna para dormir a un negrito” the pianissimo phrases were touched with a radiant tenderness. (The singer had to repeat this lullaby at the insistence of the audience.) There was the rare purity of tone, the instrumental line or the quicksilver turn of phrase throughout the evening, and one could point to passage after passage that had a special subtlety—the slightly greater legato in the second verse of Monteverdi's “Maledetto sia l'aspetto,” for example. Particularly interesting was Miss de los Angeles's singing of three Respighi songs. Where one is usually accustomed to the rich, emotion‐laden voices of Italian sopranos. there was instead a direct, unsentimental reading that made the songs seem almost classical. If Miss de los Angeles's singing was as fine as ever, so was the enchantment of her personality and so was the admiration of her audience. Carnegie Hall was sold out for the occasion, and the applause mounted in fervor as the evening progressed. For her final encore, the soprano brought out a guitar to accompany herself — a practice that has become properly indispensable by now. She couId have gone on singing encores ad infinitum as far listeners were concerned, and only the turning up of the auditorium lights finally dispersed the crowd. At the piano was the soprano's faithful and sympathetic accompanist, Paul Berl, RAYMOND ERICSON.

406-> NEW ENGLAND LOOKS TO FUTURE
The New England Council patriotically, and with considerable forethought, suggests that the 1976 Olympic Winter Games be held somewhere in New England as part of the 200th anniversary of America's independence. “The Olympic Games then would fit into the bicentennial observances of the Declaration of Independence,” said John O'Brien, an executive of the council, which is a kind of supra‐state spokesman, business and promotional organization embracing the six New England states. Mr. O'Brien said he was convinced that all of New England would support the project. He pointed out that, in other countries, participation in the Olympic Games was a national project, and that regional support from the New England States would fall naturally into this pattern.

407-> NEW CUNARD PIER DEDICATED BY CITY; Ceremony Held in Comfort on Liner Queen Mary
Pier 94 North River, at West 54th Street, the city's most modern general cargo ship terminal, was dedicated in an unusual way yesterday. In the past pier dedications —with brass bands, flag displays and speeches—have been held on the sites. However, yesterday Mayor Wagner snipped the traditional ribbon on the sheltered afterdeck of the Cunard liner Queen Mary. The 81,237‐ton ship was berthed snugly at the foot of West 50th Street. The Cunard Line, tenant of the new $5 million city‐built two‐berth terminal, decided to hold the dedication ceremony in more comfortable surroundings than in the cold and drafty new shed four blocks to the north. Thus, for the first time within memory of waterfront observers a new pier was dedicated by “remote control.” At a luncheon in the liner's first‐class dining room following the ribbon cutting, Mr. Wagner hailed the pier as a first step toward fulfilling the master plan for the Manhattan North River development to the year 2000. His speech, which also referred to the new pier as proof of the city's economic vitality, was read for him by Deputy Mayor Edward F. Cavanagh Jr. Mr. Wagner was unable to stay because of another engagement. Other speakers were Leo Brown, Commissioner of the Department of Marine and Aviation; John Bowers, executive vice president of the International Longshoremen's Association; William Y. Daly, Cunard's general manager in this country, and Charles J. Moran, deputy general manager. The steamship line is renting the two piers from the city for 20 years at about $675,000 a year. Cunard Line, which has been occupying Pier 90 since the mid‐1930's as the terminal for its large passenger liners, is scheduled to vacate that pier at the end of the month. The first of its superliners to tie up at Pier 92 will be the Queen Elizabeth on Feb. 3. Pier 90 is scheduled to be occupied by the Italian Line later this year. That line now uses Pier 84 at West 44th Street. Pier 94 — a 775‐foot freighter terminal — is connected by a new 585‐foot bulkhead shed along the riverfront with existing Pier 92, which will be the passenger liner terminal. The two terminals will be operated by Cunard as a single unit. New Pier 94 is expected to handle 150,000 tons of cargo a year. The first ship to be berthed there is the Cunard freighter Media. Cargo handling is scheduled to start next Monday.

408-> NEW ERA DAWNS ON LEGISLATURE; Carlino Recasts Work Days as Mahoney Saves Time
ALBANY, Jan. 9—The 187year‐old Legislature, which originated in the horse‐andhuggy era, is overhauling its machinery to deal with the problems of the modern age. The retooling is aimed at faster and more efficient handling of the 8,000 to 9,000 bills introduced each year, thus eliminating the annual session‐end logjams. The greatest stride is being made in the 150‐member Assembly, which, because of its size, needs it most A plan devised by Speaker Joseph F. Carlino calls for longer work weeks, earlier consideration and clearance of bills by committees and more rigid work schedules. Mr. Carlino also appointed yesterday the first whip, or assistant majority leader, for the Lower House. He is A. Bruce Manley of Fredonia, who is in his eighth year in the Republican‐controlled Assembly. He will act as general trouble shooter on the floor for the Speaker and for the majority leader, George L. Ingalls of Binghamton. In the 58‐member Senate, Majority Leader Walter J. Mahoney has also applied some oil to the legislative machinery. He has pushed through a plan to speed the disposal of noncontroversial bills. His plan will permit, under a unanimous consent rule, calling up noncontroversial bills directly from committee, thus bypassing the time‐consuming process of adding them to the regular calendar. The Carlino plan will institute longer work weeks far earlier in the session than in previous years. This will probably mean Assembly members will go from a two‐day to a three‐day work week in early February instead of in late February or March. The three‐month session will end in March. The Assembly will also institute Monday afternoon sessions and eliminate Monday evening sessions, which the Speaker called “a relic of the past.” The Monday evening sessions have never been very productive, he said, because they are short, often sparsely attended and rather noisy. Beginning the week of Jan. 20, the Assembly will convene at 2 P.M. on Monday and Tuesday, with committee meetings and hearings held in the mornings of those two days. Later in the session Wednesday be added to the work week and on that day the lower house will convene in the morning. The two houses do not hold five‐day work weeks until the closing weeks of the session. The Senate, which handles fewer bills, contemplates no change in its Monday night meetings.

409-> Princess Radziwill's First Marriage Is Annulled; Vatican Rota's Ruling Allows Sister of Mrs. Kennedy to Rewed in Charch
ROME, Feb. 16 (AP)—Princess Stanislas Radziwill, sister of Mrs. John F. Kennedy, has received an annulment by the Roman Catholic Church of a previous marriage, and has been rewed to her present husband in a Catholic service, sources connected with the Vatican Sacred Rota said today. A prelate connected with the church's high tribunal disclosed that the annulment of the Princess' previous marriage to Michael Canfield had been granted by the Rota more than a month ago. The prelate declined to be quoted by name, but Prof. Fernando Della Rocca, Roman lay advocate in the Rota, confirmed reports of the annulment, and said: “The Princess thus was free to marry Prince Stanislas Radziwill in a Catholic service. This wedding took place in London more than a month ago.” Mrs. Kennedy's sister was married in 1953 to Mr. Canfield, a former United States diplomat, who is now a publisher. That marriage ended in divorce, which the Roman Catholic Church does not recognize. She married Prince Radziwill of London later in a civil service. The annulment of the previous marriage had been requested to make it possible for the Princess to marry Prince Radziwill in the church. The 30‐year‐old Princess Radziwill is the mother of two children. Rulings of the vatican's Sacred Rota are usually secret. Only the persons involved are informed,

410-> Champagne Fete At Plaza Assists Operatic Group; Supper Dance to Help Put on Production of ‘Athaliah’ Feb. 17
A gallant band of music lovers, as undaunted by the weather as mailmen, shuttled around town last night to hear and support one of the city's newest musical organizations. Their first stop was Philharmonic Hall (half full because not everyone had their courage) for the second production of the second season of the Concert Opera Association. Then, after Verdi's “I Vespri Siciliani,” they trekked from the frozen wastes of Columbus Avenue to the windy desolation of Fifth for the association's first benefit. Postponed from Nov. 25 because o fthe death of President Kennedy, the champagne supper dance was finally held in the Terrace Roo mof the Plaza. It was a small, intimiate party as charity galas go—only 17 yellow‐topped tables and a well‐provisioned buffet. In the flickering candlelight it was hard for the 150 guests to remember the snowdrifts that would have to be faced on leaving. About half of the women at the black‐tie party wore short dresses. The others went ahead as they planned before the snow. “The long dress keeps me warm,” said Mrs. S. Chadwick Reed. At Philharmonic Hall, some of the well‐wrapped arrivals—skirts held up to clear the snow exposing big floppy boots—gave the same impression of chic and grace as Mammy Yokum. Mrs. Theodore R. Weiler had qualms about this night out. Not so her husband, whose resolve, he reports, was rewarded by light traffic and plenty of cabs. Though young, the Concert Opera Association operates in the grand tradition of New York's older musical organizations. That is, it a loss. The proceeds from last night's $50a‐person party will go toward the expenses of this season's third production, “Athaliah” by the American composer Hugo Weisgall, which will be performed on Feb. 17. Mrs. Charles M. Spofford was chairman of the party. Many of the local subscribers were absent, but not Lou Cohen, a leading merchant of Martinsburg, W. Va., and the only one of its 15,000 citizens living in a penthouse, which is atop his four‐story women's wear store. Mr. Cohen, whose home town in the Shenandoah Valley is 75 miles from Washington, flew to New York on Sunday. He is here every couple of weeks for business, cultural and social reasons.

A Texas Representative urged the airlines last week to press for cheap, fast and safe transportation rather than to build deluxe airborne restaurants.

416-> Oak and Lawn Pests Plaguing Suburbs; Sprays Suggested
A plague of oak‐leaf tiers (pronounced tie‐ers) and chinch bugs thriving on parched lawns is reported in the suburbs. Dr. P. P Pirone, senior plant pathologist at the New York Botanical Garden, and Roy C. Beckwith, entomologist at the Bartlett Tree Research Laboratories, North Stamford, Conn., said the oak pests appeared to be on an upward cycle. “They attack pin, red, scarlet and black oaks,” Dr. Pirone said, “and are bad this year in southeastern New York, Fairfield County, Conn., and on Long Island. Their build‐up began in 1959 and 1960 and became serious first in 1961 and 1962.” The oak pests get their name from the fact that they tie leaves together and feed inside them. They are the larva of a tiny moth and pupate in the litter of leaves under the trees. Dr. Pirone said the trees ideally should be sprayed before April was effective. Dr. Pirone said chinch bugs were causing heavy dam‐age to dry lawns by sucking juice out of the base of blades of grass. Sevin and Diazinon are reported effective in combatting the black bugs, which have white wings. As for birchleaf miners, Lindane is reported to be an excel‐lent pesticide if the spray is applied early in May.

417-> Sorensen Defends Kennedy's Position On Rights Program
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 (AP)—Theodore C. Sorensen, longtime adviser and friend of President Kennedy, said today the President had delayed asking for civil rights legislation because of his “unusual feel for the mood of the Congress and the country.” Mr. Sorensen is resigning this week as White House special legal counsel so he can write a book on Mr. Kennedy. He was asked on the National Broadcasting Company's “Meet the Press” television‐radio interview program about Mr. Kennedy's tactics on civil rights. He replied this way: “In the early years of his Presidency, he pressed hard for action in the civil rights area within the Executive Branch, actions which he could take on his own responsibility. “But he did not want to make a lot of bald speeches to the Congress about civil rights which would result in no action because he knew that would simply increase the frustrations of those who were being denied those rights. “When the time came for stronger civil rights legislation, he moved.” Mr. Kennedy submitted his proposals last June after there had been a wave of racial demonstrations and violence. An interviewer noted that Prof. James McGregor Burns, a biographer of Mr. Kennedy, said in an interview last December that while Mr. Kennedy showed intellectual and political commitment, “the question I raised in my book is whether he also showed a commitment of the heart, and the tragedy is we will never know.” Mr. Sorensen commented as follows: “He [Mr. Kennedy] showed a commitment of the heart in one way after another. Perhaps he didn't show it to those who barely knew him, such as Professor Burns. But to those of us who worked with him closely, day in and day out, he showed a commitment of the heart about the great issues of our time, about the people with whom he worked, about the country which he served. He very strongly had a commitment of the heart,” On possible Southern political reaction against President Johnson because of his embracing of the Kennedy civil rights program, Mr. Sorensen said: “I think the opposition to the civil rights program will continue in many quarters but I think there are signs that there is a growing realization in all parts of the country that this kind of program is necessary and that whoever is President must support such a program.”

420-> U.S. JUDGE DELAYS ALABAMA HEARING; School Injunction Request Put Off Till Next Week
MONTGOMERY, Ala., Feb. 6 — A Federal court today postponed a hearing on a Justice Department request for an order against interference in the desegregation of the Macon County High School. The action promised a week of partial relief from the racial tension that has plagued that east central Alabama county in which Negroes outnumber whites 4 to 1. Department attorneys asked District Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr. last night for a preliminary injunction against Mayor James Rea of Notasulga, town of 1,000 50 miles east of here. The Mayor turned six Negro students away from the allwhite school yesterday. Judge Johnson first set a hearing for tomorrow. But he postponed it this afternoon, without explanation, until next Thursday. Mayor Rea told reporters he would comply with any order issued by the court. “I have all the respect in the world for the courts in this country,” he said. “I wouldn't think of defying a court order.” The postponement apparently will force a delay of at least a week in the efforts of the Negroes to enroll at the school. It is also expected to bring a temporary easing of the third crisis over desegregation in public education arising from attempts by Gov. George C. Wallace to thwart the change. These developments came amid signs of growing public disaffection with the Wallace administration's tactics in the current dispute. His critics argued that he had made segregation in the public school system more vulnerable to legal attack and thus had opened the way for speeding up the process. Judge Johnson issued a temporary restraining order Monday against Mr. Wallace, the State Board of Education and the Macon County School Board. The order, which came in reply to requests from attorneys for the Justice Departnent and 12 Negro students at Tuskegee High School, held that six of the students must be permitted to transfer to Macon County High at Notasulga and the six others to Shorter High School. The action grew out of the closing of Tuskegee High last Friday by the Macon County Board under orders from the Governor and the State Board. It had been operating with only the 12 Negro students in attendance since whites withdrew last September, shortly after its desegregation. A hearing on the order against the Governor and the two education boards will be held before Judge Johnson in Opelika at the same time Mayor Rea appears. The six students transferring to Shorter High in a rural community 30 miles east of Montgomery were admited yesterday without major incident as state troopers stood guard. About 15 white students walked out at Shorter this morning after the Negroes returned for their second day of classes. But the total boycott sought by segregationists failed to materialize. Macon County High closed temporarily this morning. A fire last night caused heavy damage to the Votasulga water works and cut off the town's water supply. Mayor Rea said the city hoped to have the plant back in operation next week. He said at first that he thought arson might be involved. Two buildings were burned Tuesday night and a third was damaged on the farm of Don Mercer Davis, a member of the Macon County School Board. Board members had been under heavy criticism from whites since they agreed last September that defiance of Federal Court desegregation orders would be futile. However, Mayor Rca told reporters later that investigations by the State Fire Marshal's Office and the State Investigation Agency indicated the fire had been caused by defective electrical wiring.

422-> N. Y. U. Weighs Playing Only Those Colleges with High Academic Standards; SOME OPPONENTS MAY BE DROPPED; Violets Consider Severing Relations With Colleges Below Their Standards
New York University has stiffened entrance requirements, Athletic Director Vic Obeck said yesterday. He said the Violets might sever athletic relations with colleges that didn't raise academic standards to N.Y.U.'s level. Obeck told the Track Writers Association at a luncheon meeting in Leone's: “Some colleges have not changed athletic requirements. We have. The day might come when we wouldn't go into the top track meets, but would scledule only dual meets against colleges with similar standards. Because of this possibility, we haven't scheduled anything in any sport beyond the 1965 season. “We used to accept 600 freshmen a year for our School of Commerce. This year, we took only 140 because they were the only ones who could meet the admission requirements. Why, many great athletes of the past at N.Y.U. couldn't get in today.” Recruiting Is Difficult Obeck spoke after the N.Y.U. track coach, Joe Healey, had that metropolitan colleges were having difficulty in recruiting top student‐athletes. A boy whois accepted at N.Y.U., Healey said, can also get into “the so‐called prestige schools.” N.Y.U. has entered only 15 varsity athletes and five freshmen in the Metropolitan Intercollegiate championships May 16 at Randalls Island. Nine colleges will compete. and N.Y.U.'s entry may be the smallest. Many of the local track teams have injury problems. Here are the latest medical reports: ¶Gary Gubner, N.Y.U. shotputter—Torn right triceps tendon. Arm is out of splint and will be examined by doctor today. Has been putting lef thanded and bettering 40 feet. Probably will be ready for Metropolitan Intercollegiates. ¶Sam Perry, Fordham sprinter—Pulled right hamstring muscle five weeks ago. No indication when he will be ready. ¶Jim Warren, Manhattan quarter‐miler—Pulled right hamstring muscle two weeks ago. Jogging lightly. Doubtful for Army meet Saturday. ¶Tyrone Pannell, Manhattan hurdler—Pulled groin muscle two weeks ago. Working out, but doubtful for Army. ¶Herb Germann, Seton Hall middle‐distance runner—Spiked in right foot last Saturday while waiting for baton in relay. May miss meet with St. John's and Montclair State tomorrow. ¶Richie Dugan, Iona middledistance man—Hairline fracture of right foot. Leg in cast. Out for season.

424-> U.S. IS PRESSING CUBAN EMBARGO; Sanction Against Allies for Violations Are Weighed
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 —The United States is pressing a drive to get its allies to hold down trade with Cuba. The extent of this campaign is not yet clear. High officials are beginning to say that some of the nations or companies that deal with Cuba may be warned that they risk exclusion from United States markets. The British and French Ambassadors here were reminded anew this weekend that Washington could not let the matter rest and still expected their countries' cooperation in the economic isolation of Premier Fidel Castro's Government. Further moves are being planned for the next few weeks in the council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Suggestions of serious economic sanctions against nations that defy the United States‐sponsored embargo of Cuba have been circulating for some time in the Administration. Thus far, such sanctions have been applied only against ships and shipowners active in Cuba trade. But these measures, backed by diplomacy, have not held the line, and Cuba is said to be breaking out of her isola lation from the West. Some officials say that the embargo has failed. Spain is expected to buy 200,000 tons of Cuban sugar in 1964 and to pay for it with industrial equipment and ships. Japan and Morocco are increasing their sales to Cuba. Britain has sold her 450 buses and is now offering spare parts for Cuba's British‐built aircraft. France is selling trucks and tractors. Sweden has signed an eight‐year contract for machinery. The United States has wanted to limit sales to food and medicines and, where necessary to finance sugar purchases, to textiles and other consumer goods. Washington has argued that Cuba is a menace to the Western Hemisphere and the entir Western alliance, an agent of Soviet and, at times, Chinese Communist propaganda and subversion, and a purveyor of arms and saboteurs in the hemisphere. In response, the allies have moved increasingly toward the view that trade with Cuba should be regarded in the same category as trade with any Communist country. They have agreed to ban the shipment of weapons and other strategic goods, but not industrial equipment.

425-> Leander J. McCormick Is Dead
CHICAGO, Jan. 30‐Leander J. McCormick, grandson of one of the founders of the Interna­tional Harvester Company, died yesterday in his home in St. Tropez, France. He was 76 years old. His father, Leander Hamilton McCormick, was a nephew of Cyrus Hall McCormick, who de­veloped the reaper and estab­lished the family fortune. His grandfather, also named Lean­der J. McCormick, worked with Cyrus to establish the Harvest­er company but later withdrew and invested heavily in Chicagc real estate. Leander J. was a cousin ol Col. Robert R. McCormick, latE editor and publisher of The Chi. cagoTribune. Mr. McCormick had livec since 1947 in St. Tropez, where he was an artist. In 1959 he helc a one‐man show in Paris anc was a regular contributor tc galleries along the French Riviera. He also was an expert or game fish and was the author of “Fishing Around the World' and co‐author of “Game Fist of the World. ” Mr. McCormick was educated at the Chicago School for Boys Eton College and Cambridg University in England, and th University of Heidelberg Germany. He served in World War I as a captain in the Illinois division that was sent to France in 1917. An architect, in addition to his other accomplishments, ‐Mr. McCormick formerly was a member of the Chicago firm of Rebori, Dewey and McCormick. He designed several Chicago buildings, including the Racquet Club. He was the last survivor of three founding members of the Racquet Club. In 1917 he married Alice Cudahy of Chicago. They were divorced in 1929. In 1933 he married Renée de Fleurieu Font­race, the Countess de Fleurieu.

426-> Nursery‐School Alternatives Found; Experts Suggest Ways Parents Can Help Child to Learn
THE notices of acceptance and rejection have been sent out. A tiny segment of the 3‐ and 4‐year‐old population has been notified that it can attend New York's private nursery schools next September. The mothers of many of the rest of them are, lamentably, struggling with the conviction that their offspring have stumbled on the first step of the race that leads to Harvard. Other members of the parkbench and playground brigade are joining an unorganized revolt against nursery education. There are about 400 private nursery schools with an enrollment of 35,000 children in New York City. The insufficient number of such schools, the unavailability of public nursery education for middle‐income children, the growing awareness of the intellectual capabilities of very young children and the increasing competitiveness of the educational process have combined to build up pressure and anxiety among many parents about pre‐kindergarten schooling. Some mothers are barely discharged from the maternity wing of the hospital before they add their babies' names to the lengthy waiting lists of those nursery schools that are believed to be “preparatory schools” for certain select private elementary schools. With nursery school tuition ranging from $400 to $1,000 a year, some parents are deferring plans to send their children to school before kindergarten or first grade, choosing to apply their savings to what may amount to a costly, 20‐year educational haul. What puzzled parents ought to realize, some experts say, is that nursery school is neither an insurance policy nor a fad and it certainly is not a life or death proposition. Many experienced parents believe that although a good nursery school can expand a child's horizons immeasurably and prepare him for elementary school, much can be said in favor of keeping him home where he can blossom at his own pace. Regardless of which choice is made, the parent cannot abdicate his responsibility for stimulating and encouraging the child's growth. “I don't think nursery school is a necessary experience,” says Dr. Louie T. Camp, principal of the Hunter Elementary School, which has 2,000 applicants for 65 vacancies in the nursery school, kindergarten and first arade. “Parents can be a great help in developing the mental, physical and social abilities of their children,” he added, citing the abundance of educational phonograph records, games, puzzles and toys. Some parents who have made the rounds of private elementary schools with a child who does not have a nursery degree, so to speak, receive the impression in some quarters that this lack is counted as a black mark. According to Dr. Dorothy Deegan, director of admissions of Friends Seminary, “as far as being an admissions factor, nursery school attendance is neither one way or another. We would have no hesitation in taking a child who has not attended.” However, she declared, “We do see a difference, often, in those who have learned to play with a group.” How this knowledge is acquired does not matter, she indicated. Can Benefit at Home Dr. Deegan has advised parents that “it takes some conscious doing, but a family can provide almost all of the benefits of nursery school without sending a child to one on a continuing and regular basis.” She suggests an approach that many parents have successfully tried, one that costs far less than a five‐day‐a‐week nursery school. It involves combining group activity with music or art one or two days a week. At the People's Art Center of the Museum of Modern Art, classes in painting and other art expression are given for children of 3 or older. There are also classes for children and their parents. The cost of a 15week course (one‐hour class once a week) including materials is $40 for children and $60 for parents and children. At the Diller Quaile School of Music, 24 East 95th Street, classes for children of 2½ and up are given for 45 minutes, twice a week. Rhythms, songs and musical games are taught. The fee is $160 for an eightmonth course for the youngest group, $175 for 3‐year‐olds and above. There is a $5 registration fee. Musio School Sessions The Dalcroze School of Music has half‐hour classes once a week for children of 2½ and up. The fee is $60 for eight months with a $10 registration fee. Many churches have Sunday school programs for 3‐year‐olds that serve as play groups with slightly religious overtones. The York School for Nursery Years, 9 East 90th Street, offers a Saturday program that includes art classes and a shop class for parents and children (4 is the minimum age here), The art classes cost $45 a semester and the shop class is $65 a semester. Among other flexible play arrangements Is the Bloomingdale Pre‐School Play Program, 885 Columbus Avenue, for 2‐ to 5‐year‐olds, run by volunteer mothers three mornings a week. There is no charge, but mothers contribute help.

427-> U.S. IN U.N. DENIES CHARGES BY CUBA; Council Is Given Refutation of Piracy Accusation
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Feb. 7 — The United States gave the Security Council today a detailed refutation of Cuban charges that the seizure of four Cuban fishing boats by the United States Coast Guard off Key West on Monday was a “crude act of piracy.” It also disclosed that two of the crew members had .asked for and received political asylum in the United States. The United States said that two of the four skippers had admitted that they were knowingly fishing in United States territorial waters less than three miles off the coast when they were seized. Adlai E. Stevenson, chief United States delegate, made the statements in a letter addressed to Carlos Alfredo Bernardes of Brazil, this month's president of the 11‐member Council, for circulation to all members. With regard to the charges of piracy and improper procedures, United States sources remarked privately that both Mexico and Peru had repeatedly seized North American fishing boats in what those countries consid the traditional three mile limit. Brazil also has seized French vessels that were trapping lobsters off the Brazilian coast. Mr. Stevenson's letter was an answer to a protest made by Cuba to the Council on Tuesday. On the same date the United States sent a note to Cuba protesting what it called the violation of United States waters by the Cuban fishing boats. Cuba said she rejected that protest. The Cuban protest to the Security Council termed the seizure “an act of intolerable aggression” and “a crude act of piracy.” It asserted that when the four boats were seized they were fishing “outside territorial waters, five miles off the coast of the Dry Tortugas in a fishing ground always used by Cuban vessels.” Mr. Stevenson's letter said that the four boats were found on Sunday “fishing within the territorial sea (i.e. inside the three‐mile limit) of the United States off East Iiey in Dry Tortugas.” It said that when they anchored, as ordered by the Coast Guard, they were found to be between 1.5 and 1.9 miles froth the shore of East Key. It continued: “Two of the masters of the fishing boats — José Manuel Ventbra of the Cardenas No. 14 and Manuel Gomez Barrios of the Lambda No. 8—admitted to ’ United States Coast Guard officials that they were knowingly fishing in United States waters.” The letter denied Cuban accusations that the crews were not allowed to communicate with Havana by radio. Gommercial services in the Florida area monitored conversations between the boats and Havana, it said. Fishing by foreign vessels in United States waters is forbidden by Section 251 of Title 46 of the United States Code, Mr. Stevenson said. Since no penalty is provided under Federal Iaw, the Cuban boats and crews were handed over to the state jurisdiction of Florida for prosecution under state law.

428-> U.S. LOSSES STUDIED IN VEGETABLE OILS
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (AP)—Senator John L.

At issue are vegetable oil purchases by the Agriculture Department's Commodity Credit Corporation in contracts with the Shortening Corporation of America, Inc., of Jersey City, N. J., headed by Anthony DeAngelis, the Senator said. Senator John J. Williams, Republican of Delaware, in a Senate speech last August criticized both the department and Mr. DeAngelis. He charged the Government had wound up owning “about $ i 0 million worth of rancid oil” purchased from Mr. DeAngelis' company and the Scarburgh Company, Inc., of New York City, which he described as headed by Jakob Isbrandtsen.

431-> Wallace Enters Maryland Race With Attack on Civil Rights Bill
ANNAPOLIS, Md., March 9 —Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama entered his second Presidential primary today by announcing that he would seek Maryland's 48 nominating votes at the Democratic National Convention. He said that he might enter two more Presidential primaries. Governor Wallace's day started with a news conference in Baltimore and ended here tonight when he paid the $290 filing fee to enter Maryland's preferential primary May 19. The voters' choice in the Presidential primary here is considered binding on the convention delegation only on the first ballot. The segregationist Alabama Governor said that his mission here and elsewhere — he has filed in Wisconsin and may enter the primaries in Indiana and California—was “to give the people an opportunity to protest against socialism and liberalism” as embodied in the civil rights bill now before the Senate. He called it a dangerous bill that would “destroy the right of free ownership of private property.” “It is time that we inform some of these politicians [who are supporting the bill] that they are behind the times,” he said at his news conference in Baltimore. “We are going to conduct a massive education program,” Governor Wallace said. He pre‐dicted that the civil rights bill would be repealed in “two to four years” if it was passed. Governor Wallace's decision to enter the primary here came as a surprise and a shock to the Democratic organization in Maryland, which had expected to deliver the state's nominat‐ing votes to President Johnson without a fight. No major can‐didates of either party have filed in the primary here. Accordingly, the political con‐sternation here was at least as sharp as in Wisconsin, where the Alabama Governor suddenly appeared last Friday to file in that state's Presidential primary. Gov. John W. Reynolds was forced abruptly to cancel a long‐planned European business tour in order to stay at home to organize a primary campaign against Mr. Wallace. The strategy here, expected to be announced later this week, is to draft Senator Daniel B. Brewster, a liberal, to oppose Governor Wallace.

437-> In The Nation; It's an Old Scranton Custom
WASHINGTON, April 9 — Both the Republican and Democratic parties are split down the seams, but more of the Republican rift is showing. That is chiefly because it has been exposed by an active contest for the Presidential nomination that the presence of a Democrat in the White House has forestalled in his party. Even the Democratic minorities which oppose parts of President Johnson's legislative program and are critical of some of his foreign policies are impelled to support him in the next general election by the personal benefices which derive from belonging to the party in power. By his firm announcement today that he is not even a receptive candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, the purpose being to quash the spreading, spontaneous movement in his behalf, Governor Scranton of Pennsylvania kept the active party contest within its present bounds. But, though this was the pre‐convention effect insofar as formal and pregnant candidacies are concerned, his expressed conviction that “no American has a right” to decline a Presidential draft preserved the strong possibility that Scranton will be conscripted, as was an even more unwilling Democrat in 1952. In that year Adlai E. Stevenson expressed his resistance in words with more finality than Scranton employed today, and yet was truly and unanimously drafted. Stevenson, pleading with the Illinois delegation to block any movement for him at the convention, went to the historic extreme of saying he felt he lacked essential qualifications for the Presidency. Scranton's abjurement today breathed the same unquestionable sincerity. But the reasons he gave were impersonal, unemotional and implied no anguished doubt of his capacity to assume the burdens of the Presidency if election should be the outcome of a nominating draft. These stated reasons were that the Republicans already have an adequate number of “excellent” aspirants; and that either his active or receptive candidacy for the Presidential nomination would obstruct the completion of his obligation to the people of Pennsylvania who elected him to a full term as Governor. But the resolve of a national convention to draft its nominee is not diminished by such considerations on his part. And, because of the abrasive character of the Republican pre‐convention contest, Scranton is no less likely to be drafted after today's statement than before. Senator Goldwater and Governor Rockefeller are each bitterly opposed by a powerful Republican faction. The belief of Harold E. Stassen that these factions could or would unite on him appears to be almost wholly his own. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, the new leader in the random samplings of party preference by the professional pollsters, is deeply unpopular with a large number of party organizations and their workers for what they estimate to have been his slack campaign after his nomination for Vice President in 1960 and because he is a two‐time loser as well. The old, and far from extinct, Republican group which almost succeeded in nominating Robert A. Taft in 1952 has never forgiven Lodge for the strategies he employed to win the nomination for General Eisenhower. And if Goldwater fails to get a majority of the delegates this year, there is every indication that he would do his utmost to prevent the endorsement of Eisenhower Republicanism as well as the blunting of the foreign policy issue by the choice of President Johnson's Ambassador to Vietnam, and divert it to Richard M. Nixon. But Nixon, though he missed the Presidency by the narrowest margin in history, also is a two‐time loser, his last defeat more damaging and more recent than Lodge's. This creates the kind of political situation in which Scranton has grown accustomed to a call to unsought and undesired duty. He rejected every effort to send him to Congress until his supporters cleared the field of a bitter and calamitous intraparty contest. Toward the nomination for Governor his position was the same: he would not accept it unless unanimously endorsed by the 60 county chairmen. Each time his condition was met—that he would run only to avert a party “blood‐bath.” It is already conceivable that he will be confronted with the same threat at San Francisco.

439-> INDIANS' 2 HOMERS DOWN TIGERS, 2–1; Alvis and Held Connect—Cleveland Leads League
DETROIT, May 16— Cleveland took sole possession of first place in the American League as Max Alvis and Woodie Held hit homers to give the Indians a 2‐1 victory over the Detroit Tigers today. The Indians had a half‐game lead over the Baltimore Orioles, who downed the Los Angeles Angels, 5‐1, tonight at Baltimore and moved into second place. The Chicago White Sox dropped to third, a game off the pace, after losing to the Senators, 3‐1, at Washington in an afternoon contest. Alvis's sixth‐inning clout disrupted a brilliant pitching duel between Ed Rakow of Detroit and the Cleveland left‐hander, Jack Kralick. Held led off the seventh inning with his eighth homer of the season. George Thomas tripled and scored on a single by Dick Mcauliffe in the seventh for Detroit's run. Kralick posted his third straight victory without a loss and lowered his earned run average to 1.13, second best in the league. The Indians made six of their hits in the first three innings but could not score. The Tigers posted one serious scoring threat earlier in the game when Don Demeter doubled leading off the fourth inning. But Kralick got the next two batters on infield grounders and Norm Cash flied to center. It was the seventh loss for the Tigers in nine one‐run decisions this year. Rakow, who departed after seven innings in favor of a pinch hitter, was tagged with his second loss of the season against no victories. In addition to the two home runs, Rakow allowed only six singles. He struck out seven and did not issue any walks. Dick Egan pitched the last two innings for Detroit and was touched for one single.

441-> LUNAR CAPSULE TESTED IN FLIGHT; Escape System Is Success Despite Loss of a Chute
WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N. M., May 13 — An unmanned Apollo moon capsule was rocketed almost five miles high today to test the intricate workings of the emergency escape system. Although only two of the three main parachutes blossomed properly, the test was adjudged highly successful by officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Had the capsule been manned for the projected expedition to the moon, none of the three crewmen would have been endangered by failure of one of the chutes. The failure did produce a higher‐than‐ideal descent speed. But it was still below the descent speed of the capsules used in the four successful Mercury manned flights in earth orbit. This was the way the Northrop Company designers had planned it. They had devised a system with one more parachute than required for safe descent specifically as a hedge against a malfunction such as occurred today. The test was the second to check out the system for saying astronauts' lives in case of rocket‐booster trouble early in an Apollo flight. But it had several more critical features than the first, which took place last fall and involved simply triggering the escape system from a standing start on the launching pad. The most important new feature was triggering of the system at an altitude where aerodynamic stresses would be near maximum. Altogether, today's test provided a small measure of encouragement that Project Apollo, although confronted with tightening budgets and a to‐beexpected run of technical troubles, might still make President eKnnedy's goal of a manned landing on the moon by 1970. Except for the parachute failure, the flight went off as the book prescribed. The General Dynamics‐Convair booster rocket, a solidpropellant Little Joe 2 generating 303,000 pounds of thrust, took off within milliseconds of target time, its exhaust painting a thick pastel green stripe against the sky. Event then followed event in a rapid sequence that stuck close to a precisely calculated schedule: separation of main capsule from units below; firing of rockets on the escape tower mounted above the coneshaped main capsule; jettisoning of the derrick‐like tower; deployment of the single drogue or stabilizing chute, and finally deployment of the three pilot and three main chutes. All three main chutes were seen being pulled out of their canisters by the pilot chutes. But one broke away without filling with air. The three‐man crew cabin, the same size as the command module to be used for the lunar journey but more crudely biilt, landed upright four miles from the pad about 7½ minutes after takeoff. The capsule hit the ground at a descent speed of about 20 miles an hour, compared with three‐chute speed of about 17 miles an hour. Damage was no more than expected, mainly on the underside. An official said the command module had been rotating while suspended under the drogue chute, the first to deploy. There was evidence from bits of cord that, when the main chutes deployed, shroud lines from one of them caught under brace on the side of the capsule. The lines were wound into a tight wad. When the chute finally started to open and applied decelerating pressure, the lines evidently were cut. The chute itself was found ripped. A decision was made some time ago to modify the system to use two drogue chutes. But pressure of time did not allow the change to be incorporated for today's flight. Engineers said the failure probably would not have occurred if the change had been made. They said also that the brace would be moved out of the way with a minor design change. It is planned to conduct a maximum‐stress test at an altitude of 32,000 feet near the end of the year. The three ‐ man command module will not make the actual lunar landing. That will be made by a lunar excursion module, known as the LEM, or bug. Two crewmen will transfer to the bug after the flight reaches orbit around the moon. The bug will rejoin the com mand module, as well as a service or equipment module, on the way home. Only the command module will return all the way to earth.

446-> The Business Bookshelf
ANNUAL REPORT OF STOCKHOLDER ACTIVITIES AT CORPORATION MEETINGS. For 24 years the brothers Gilbert, the corporate annual meeting gadflies, have been publishing a report of their activities at annual meetings and the success of some of their associates in the cause they call “stockholder democracy.” In its first years the report evoked a smile or a shrug of indifference from top corporate officials. These days quite a few of them or their public relations men peruse it, hoping for compliments and picking up ideas to improve their corporate image. Circulation this year is at a record of 7,000, not in the best‐seller class bt still a solid indication of readership. The report makes corporate sense in that it provides discussions of how managements operate. The gadflies have been pressing for years for rotation of annual meetings. As a result, the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey), General Mills, P. Lorillard, W. R. Grace and others have made the move to give a broader group of stockholders the chance to attend. The Gilberts say that the F. W. Woolworth Company clings to annual meetings in Watertown, N. Y., because R. C. Kirkwood, president, insists, “We have stockholders all over the United States. It wouldn't be possible to find any one city where many could attend.” The Gilberts make no further comment. The Ford Motor Company was castigated for having only two microphones for shareholder use at its annual meeting and a failure to have microphones in front of all the directors on the dais. Such criticism shows that the Gilberts have a penchant for the fine points of annual meetings, although some seem picayune. However, there is nothing insignificant about their attempts to persuade more companies to break down divisional sales and earnings. Compliments on this score go to the National Distillers and Chemical Corporation and Budd Company, for example. How much is a businessman worth? The report points a disapproving finger at some high corporate salaries, indicating growing stockholder disgruntlement at rising executive compensation, whether straight salaries, profit sharing, pensions or the like. The role of the director is explored, with the conclusion that directors' meetings should be held at least 10 times a year. However, the report makes no determination of what is a reasonable directors' fee‐$20 a meeting as in the case of some companies to $6,000 a year at others. It holds that companies should have one or more outside directors, ones not working for the company. The press coverage of anmual meetings comes under a critical review with kudos here and there. In all, it's a distillation of the changing currents in the field of managementstockholder relations, but it is not very peppy and not written in a way to induce many shareholders to read it. Like some of the annual reports mentioned, it could stand some zip.

447-> International Minerals Lifts Earnings
Reflecting increased sales, net earnings of the International Minerals and Chemical Corporation rose to $6,483,000 in the quarter ended March 31 from $4,876,000 earned in the similar three months of 1963. The earnings equalled $1.96 a share on 3,092,436 common shares compared with $1.71 a share on 2,803,517 shares a year before. The number of shares was increased in the quarter by conversion of debentures called for redemption in March, according to the report issued yesterday. Sales for the period, which is the third quarter of the concern's fiscal year, rose to $63, 777,000 from $52,701,000 in the March quarter last year. The third‐quarter increases, following record first and second quarters, were attributed mainly to forward buying by fertilizer manufacturers ahead of an expected rail car shortage during the peak of the fertilizer season. As a result, it was stated by T. M. Ware, president, the fourth fiscal quarter ending June 30, is not expected to match the record reached in the June quarter last year. He estimated that barring an extended rail strike or unforeseen difficulties, earnings for the fiscal year ending in June would be “about 40 per cent” above the $3.53 a share earned in the year to June 30, 1963. For the nine months to March 31, net earnings climbed to $10,585,000 or $3.33 a share, from $2,837,000, or 91 cents a share, inthe prior year's period. Sales totaled $152,158,000 and $119,377,000 respectively. First‐quarter sales of P. Lorillard Company were reported yesterday at $100,588,528, compared with $120,750,038 for the March quarter of 1963. Net earnings declined to $2,663,158, or 37 cents a common share, from $5,331,210, or 78 cents a common share, for the first three months of 1963. Morgan J. Cramer, president of the cigarette producer, said the results reflected the full initial impact of the Surgeon General's report released in January. As a result, January sales fell sharply and continued their decline through February. A turnabout in March began the climb. So far in April sales are running ahead of 1963, he said. The company, the country's oldest tobacco producer, makes Kent, Newport, Spring, Oil Gold Spin Filters and Old Gold Straights. As the nation's largest manufacturer of little cigars, it produces Madison, Between the Acts and new Omega filter‐tip little cigars. Other products include India House and Briggs smoking tobaccos and Beechnut chewing tobacco. Operations of United Artists Corporation in the first quarter this year resulted in net earnings approximating $2,025,000, the highest for any quarter in the company's history, Robert S. Benjamin, chairman and Arthur B. Krim, president, reported yesterday. The earnings are equal to $1.10 a share on 1,848,630 shares outstanding. The net compares with $578,000, or 31 cents a share, cleared in the first three months last year. The 1964 earnings do not reflect the proceeds from a television network deal made earlier this year with ABC‐TV for feature motion pictures. The amount of the proceeds was not disclosed. but trade circles estimated it at $7 to I8 million. Last year the company had a net loss of $831,000, equal to 45 cents a share after giving effect to a tax credit of $93,000. This contrasted sharply with $3,815,000, or $2.06 a share, earned in 1962. Gross income dipped to $124,573,000 from $126,259,000. Sales of the Zayre Corporation, self‐service departmentstore chain based in Natick, Mass., passed the $100 million mark for the first time in the fiscal year ended Jan. 25, Stanley H. Feldberg, president, reported yesterday. Sales rose 27.4 per cent to $122,810,651 from $96,431,611 in the previous fiscal year. Net income amounted to $1,222,879, or 73 cents a share, compared with $1,374,494, or 82 cents a share, for the prior fiscal year. Mr. Feldberg said that over half of the 61 Zayre stores had not been in operation long enough to reach full profitability in the year. This includes 14 new stores opened in fiscal 1964 and 21 units opened the previous year. 9 mos. to Feb. 25 1964 1963 Net sales ......... $11,670,646 $9,222,157 Net income ........ 327,266 *1,371,760 *Net loss.   12 wks. to March 29    1964 1963 Net sales ......... $17,971,819 $14,323,019 Net income ........ 1,251,167 1,052,955 Shr. earns. ........ 60c 51c Qtr. to March 31 1964 1963 Net sales ......... $16,754,171 $15,294,684 Net income ........ 919,216 950,667 Shr. earns. ........ 31c 32c 6 mos. net sales ... 31,974,077 29,240,131 Net income ........ 1,654,688 1,694,779 Shr. earns. ........ 56c 57c .

448-> Mayor Says Stall‐In Holds ‘A Gun to Heart of the City’
Mayor Wagner warned civil rights demonstrators yesterday that the city would do everything it could to “safeguard human life, law, order and property.” In a special statement he said that those who threatened to tie up traffic on approaches to the World's Fair were trying to hold “a gun to the heart of the city.” 31. The stall‐in, he said, will hurt the cause of civil rights both here and in Congress. The statement, made late in the afternoon, was the strongest the Mayor has made on the plans of some civil rights leaders to hold massive demonstrations in conjunction with the opening of the World's Fair tomorrow. The Mayor has been criticized for not making clear his position on the stall‐in. He has also been urged to meet with the stall‐in leaders. In his statement yesterday, the Mayor said: “I am always ready to meet with responsible groups or leaders with legitimate problems or complaints. I am ready to do so tonight or tomorrow if the request is made. I will not, however, meet, parley with or recognize any group which seeks to hold a gun to the heart of the city.” A City Hall press aide said yesterday that the Mayor felt that the stall‐in leaders had never made an official request for a meeting. “We've read in the newspapers that they wanted to meet with the Mayor,” the aide said, “and we heard that they sent us a telegram, but we have no record of the telegram.” The aide said however, that at a meeting with Madison S. Jones, executive director of the City Commission in Human Rights, some of the leaders said they would like to meet with the Mayor. At the headquarters of the Brooklyn chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, which has led the stall‐in movement, a spokesman said the initiative for a meeting “had to come from the Mayor and we haven't heard from him yet.” In his statement yesterday the Mayor backed the plans of Polic e Commissioner Michael J. Murphy to deal with stall‐in. He said: “I say to those New Yorkers who are concerned with the cause of civil rights that such undertakings as the stall‐in do more harm to the civil rights cause both in Congress and here in New York City than anything that Dixiecrat Senators can do in Washington or that the forces of bigotry can do in the city.” He said he could assert “without fear of contradiction that New York City has done more on the civil rights front than any other city in the nation.” This, he said, does not mean the city had done enough. “We must do much better,” he said. Mr. Wagner said that “irresponsible tactics and threat of blatant interference with the right of public access to homes, hospitals, places of work and the use of public highways for vehicles including ambulances and fire trucks cannot be tolerated.” A Fire Department spokesman said fire apparatus used parkways annd expressways only when “the fire is on the same.” A police spokesman said that it was sometimes faster to use parkways and expressways but that police units used alternate routes when traffic delay developed. He added that ambulances did not normally use parkways and expressways because of the danger of protracted traffic snarls. The Mayor said that “those individuals who take the law into their own hands mmmust of course expect to bear the responsibility therefor.”

449-> CHURCHES STUDY FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Year‐Long Project Seeks to Spur Protestant Interest
A year‐long project to encourage churchgoers’ interest in international affairs will get under way on Monday. The project, directed by the Department of International Affairs of the National Council of Churches, will center on study groups in local congregations. The National Council will provide resource materials it has developed in a two‐year planning period. Seminars on world problems will also be held this summer at the hiterdénominational Church Center for the United Nations. The seminars are designed to appeal primarily to church groups visiting the World's Fair. The Rev. Dr. Leonard J Kramer, a former head of the political science department at Hanover College in Indiana, is the administrator of the proj‐ect, called the Program of Edu‐cation and Action for Peace. Dr. Kramer said, in describ‐ing the project, that the churches were probably more active in international affairs than many realized. But, he went on, “we are not doing nearly enough.” “When we deepen our con‐cern, sharpen our competence and increase our involvement In international affairs, we be‐come what, in the divine econ‐omy, we are meant to be,” he said. Among the materials pre‐ pared by the Nationál Council, which is a federation of 31 Protestant and Eastern Ortho‐ dox denominations, are a study guide on peace with related Biblical meditations and a pa‐ perback book entitled, “Man Amid Change in World Af‐ fairs.” Question, and Answer Paine College in Angusta, Ga., reports that its Methodist chaplain, the Rev. Dr. Roy C. DeLamotte, preached theshort‐ est sermon in the college's 80‐ year history last Sunday. Dr. DeLamotte's topic was, “What Does Christ Answer When We Ask: ‘Lord, What's In Religion For Me?’” The complete text of his re‐ marks follows: “Nothing.” He said later that his sermon was a corrective for people “brought up on the gimme‐ gimme gospel of positive think‐ ing.” When someone asked Dr. DeLamotte how long it had taken him to prepare his mes‐ sage, his reply was, “Twenty years.” College to Run Magazine Ownership of the Catholic Digest, a mass‐circulation Ro‐ man Catholic magazine, has been given to the College of St., Thomas in St. Paul Minn. The gift was announced yes‐terday by the Rev. Louis A. Gales, president, and the Rev. Paul Bussard, publisher. They are co‐owners of the monthly publication, which has a circula‐tion of 650,000 in the United States and 150,000 in its German, French and Philip‐ pine editions. Msgr. James P. Shannon, president of the college, said that no changes in personnel or editorial policy of the magazine were contemplated. Its offices are in Roseville, a suburb of St. Paul. Msgr. Shannon said that the “joining of one of the most important Catholic publishing ventures in the history of the Church in America with this in‐stitution. at a time when the college is achieving national recognition as a center of aca‐demic excellence kindles ex‐pectations of a significant contribution to Catholic life.” Church Being Restored Restoration work at. St. Peter's Protestant Episcopal Church, a pre‐Revolutionary War structure in Van Cort‐landtville, N. Y., was started recently. A committee headed by Mrs. Paul F. Barham of Peekskill has raised $1,000 for exterior repairs and hopes to acquire enough for a complete renewal.

451-> In The Nation; Anatomy of the Lure of the Invisible Man
WASHINGTON, April 16—Why is it that, as the war the United States is masterminding in Vietnam grows from bad to worse, the indicators of Republican Presidential preference are moving in the other direction for Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, the Democratic Administration's principal civilian mastermind on the scene? This curiosity of politics is being more intensively analyzed for its sources since the write‐in of Lodge's name by 5 per cent of the Republicans who voted in Tuesday's Illinois Presidential preference primary. For 5 per cent is an index of considerable support when the name of the beneficiary is not on the ballot and he is, moreover, engaged in a secular activity ten thousand miles away. In exploring the sources of this lure of “the invisible man,” none has been more diligent than Robert R. Mullen, a Washington public relations counselor who is the volunteer national coordinator at “Draft Lodge” headquarters. In a current report Mullen has traced these sources as follows: one‐third, women who watched Lodge's performance on day‐time television programs when he was President Eisenhower's Ambassador to the United Nations; one‐third, those who admire him for suggesting to President Kennedy his assignment to the difficult post he now occupies; onethird, those who find in Lodge some of the qualities they admired in Mr. Kennedy. “It has been in largest measure from letters coming into this headquarters,” Mullen reported, “that we have found the people who organized Lodge movements now under way in forty states. In our first roundup, Jan. 16, 1964, before the New Hampshire primary, we had only eight state organizations and we had to admit that most were weak.” The following extracts he cited from these letters confirmed Mullen's estimate of the three principal sources from which are derived whatever percentage of support Lodge may have for the Republican nomination: . “Some political analysts are saying that [those who have voted for the Ambassador in primaries or expressed the preference in sample polls] are merely rejecting Rockefeller or Goldwater. ... Actually, he is remembered for brilliant and courageous handling of the nation's destiny in the U.N.” . “Although I have never met Mr. Lodge I have been impressed by his record in World War II [when he resigned from the Senate to enter the armed services], his devotion to the first Eisenhower campaign and his acceptance of the Ambassadorship to South Vietnam.” . “Even here . . . the trend has swung to Mr. Lodge. ... He is the only Republican candidate with worldwide appeal.” . “I like informally to poll my passengers. Mr. Lodge may not like or agree with the following association. But I thought it interesting that so many people made the same type of comment. As one put it, ‘Lodge is cut out of the same piece of cloth as Kennedy.’ ” But Mullen got especial encouragement from letters which disputed a general criticism of Lodge among the Republican leaders and party workers‐that his indolence as a campaigner in 1960 conceivably was a major contributory factor to the defeat of the Nixon—Lodge ticket. “We had an ox roast here [Elyria, Ohio,] in the early fall of 1960,” one of these letters related, “and had been promised Mr. Nixon, but Mr. Lodge came instead. When we heard the news we were disappointed, but it turned out to be the biggest thing we ever had in our part of the state. He was wonderful, charming, gracious and must have shaken 1,000 hands.” These communications demonstrate no more than the basis of Mullen's tracing of Lodge's support sources. And, unless what is as yet merely a curiosity of politics is transmuted into a miracle, the odds seem insuperable against the nomination of Lodge. But so much has been published here of Lodge's asserted handicaps —as nominee he would blunt the Republican foreign policy issue; his views on controversial subjects are unknown; he is a two‐time loser; he is intensely unpopular with party workers, etc.—that a fair balance requires this report of the rosy view from Mullen's headquarters.

453-> LUSAKA PREPARES A DRAFT CHARTER; Independent North Rhodesia to Have Presidential Rule
LUSAKA, Northern Rhodesia April 28 — The Northern Rhodesian Government's draft of a Constitution gives sweeping powers to a President at the territory's independence from Britain, scheduled for next Oct. 24. The proposed Constitution was only slightly amended during a week's round of talks with the two opposition parties, the National Progress party and the African National Congress, prior to the constitutional conference in London. Northern Rhodesia, a British protectorate, now has internal self‐government. Under the draft Constitution, the republic's President will have authority to select and remove the Vice President, the 14 ministers and the junior ministers, or parliamentary secretaries. He will be able to convene and dismiss the Parliament. The President will be the commender in chief of the armed forces and will have the power to hire and fire top‐level members of the police. In Zambia, as the republic will be known, there will be a National Assembly and a House of Chiefs. The National Assembly will have '75 elected members and up to five members nominated by the President. The House of Chiefs, representing the 73 tribes of the country, will have only deliberative and advisory powers. High Judges Appointive There will be a High Court, whose head, the Chief Justice, will be appointed by the President of the republic. In addition to the High Court, there will be a Court of Appeal. No appeal to the Privy Council can be made from the decision of the Court of Appeal. The President will be chosen by a secret ballot among members of the National Assembly. The President will not be a member of the National Assembly, but he will have the power to address it at his will. The first President will be chosen prior to independence. All bills passed by the Parliament must have the assent of the President before becoming law. The President may refuse to accept a measure and send it back to the National Assembly. A bill returned by the President must remain in the National Assembly for six months unless a two‐thirds majority of all members support the bill. If the President still refuses the bill, he may dissolve the Assembly. Constitution, which has been drafted by the governing party, the United National Independence party, has drawn fire from the opposing African party, the African National Congress, as being “dictatorial.” The National Congress, once the dominant party in the territory, demands that an independent Zambia—they want the name to be Mukuba (which means copper)—have both a President and a Prime Minister. Europeans Keep Role 'The National Progress party, which represents the economic interests of the 77,000 Europeans in the territory, appears to have successfully bargained for retention after independence of the 10 seats it now holds. The leader, H. John Roberts, who was leader of the defunct United Federalist party, threatened to hold up the scheduled independence if the reserved seats were abolished. Prime Minister Kenneth D. Kaunda had promised his supporters that after independence there would no longer be any reserved seats and that all members of Parliament would be elected from a common roll. The Government's apparent agreement to permit reserved seats for five more years, the life of the National Assembly, soothes European fears of African domination and enlists European support for independence without a new general election. The last general election was held last January. Harry M. Nkumbula, the leader of the African National Congress, failed in his demand that the Europeans' reserved seats in Parliament be abolished after independence. The congress demands that the British Government require general elections to be held prior to independence.

Tommy Richardson, starting his fourth year as president of the minor league, predicted an upswing in attendance for 1964. The league drew 1,500,000 people, with 10 cities last year. The prediction for this year is 1,400,000, with eight cities. The league, after experimenting with 10 teams last year when it added Indianapolis and Little Rock, lopped off these two cities during the winter. Indianapolis and Little Rock have joined the Pacific Coast League. In today's games, Rochester will be at Jacksonville, Syracuse at Atlanta, Toronto at Columbus and Buffalo at Richmond.

457-> Europe Seen Raising Its Imports of Pearls
NEW YORK — With increased prosperity in Europe, the Continent now is accounting for a larger percentage of pearl imports, according to the Japan Cultured Pearl Ex‐ porters Association. The effect has been stronger competition for supplies with American importers. Last year's exports of cultured pearls by Japan amounted to $47,235,000. Of the available crop, Europe took 43 per cent against 40 per cent for the United States. Six years ago the percentages were Europe, 35 per cent, and the United States, 58 per cent.

458-> In The Nation; It All Depends on Whose Ox Is Gored
WASHINGTON, April 15 — Senator Goldwater has deliberately made himself the most controversial figure in this Presidential year by taking positions to which a very influential and articulate group in both parties and in the press is emotionally opposed. Hence, even when he wins emphatically, as in the Illinois Presidential preference primary, the victory will be analyzed adversely on the argument that his total percentage fell below the figure the analysts themselves fixed as meaningful. And any worthy Republican opponent can depend on attracting the votes of the very considerable anti‐Goldwater faction in the party in the primaries to come. A large segment of this influential and articulate bipartisan group is also committed to the Houseapproved equal rights legislation now pending in the Senate and against any truly moderating amendment. Therefore, when a popular referendum, as in the Wisconsin Presidential preference primary, indicates notably greater opposition to the House draft than the group has forecast, its political and press augurs reverse their test of the meaning of percentages. So their analyses of the Illinois and Wisconsin results come out like this: 1. Since 75 per cent of the vote in the Wisconsin Democratic and Republican primaries was cast for candidates who support the House bill, the fact that Governor Wallace of Alabama gathered only 25 per cent of the total demonstrates the weakness of the protest of which he was the sole symbol, just as adequately for practical purposes as the forecast maximum of 10 per cent would have done. 2. Since Goldwater polled only 64 per cent of the Republican total in the Illinois Presidential primary, and 26 per cent was cast for Mrs. Senator Smith of Maine, whose nomination prospects are generally deemed to be nil, these figures show that Goldwater's best‐fortified strongholds are crumbling under enormous Republican opposition to his choice by the San Francisco convention. Thus, by using their own special computer, and shifting the gears to produce opposite meanings for the same statistics, the bipartisan antiGoldwater group has it both ways in findings widely circulated in the press and on video. Perhaps this juggling of voting figures to establish advance conclusions will be effective on the decisions of Congress and the national party conventions. But, so far as Goldwater's hopes to win for the Republican nomination are concerned, a candid analysis of the Illinois primary results would supply sufficient evidence that these hopes are dimming. Richard M. Nixon was unopposed in the 1960 Presidential primary in that state, but 782,849 Republicans turned out to vote for him. Four years previously, Robert A. Taft got 73 per cent of the Republican primary ballots, although, unlike Mrs. Smith, two of his opponents, Harold E. Stassen and particularly General Eisenhower, were supported by well‐financed, nationwide organizations. In the 1964 Illinois primary also, 150,000 Republicans who participated in the hot contest between Charles H. Percy and William J. Scott for the party nomination for Governor did not mark the Presidential ballot. And Scott, the loser, was an all‐out Goldwater man. In an equally hot contest for the Republican Gubernatorial choice in 1960, the voting in that and in the Presi‐ dential tests were about the same. The backers of the pending equal rights bill without substantial change would not, however, be sustained by a candid analysis of the protest vote for Wallace in the Wisconsin and Illinois primaries. The significance of the support in the Wisconsin Democratic poll for that opponent of the legislation who, as Senator Jordan of North Carolina remarked, was a“bad image” of the cause, cannot be explained away by citing that, though the bipartisan margin against Wallace was forecast at a minimum of 90 per cent, it was, after all, 75. For if Wallace, with all those strikes against him, could draw a protest vote of that size, obviously a respected opponent like Senator Russell or Senator Byrd would have drawn much more. The outcome of Wallace's bid in the Indiana and Maryland Democratic primaries may support the contention that his showing in Wisconsin was another freak performance by an unpredictable electorate. But what if it doesn't?

463-> CHURCH SUPPORTS JAILED MINISTER; Harrington Protest at Fair Backed ‘With Admiration’
The Community Church of New York announced yesterday that it approved “with admiration” its senior minister's participation in World's Fair demonstrations leading to his arrest. A statement distributed to the congregation of the church, at 40 East 35th Street, included a resolution passed by the Board of Trustees. It said that the board “approves with admiration the participation of the senior minister, Donald S. Harrington, in the freedom demonstration at the World's Fair on April 22, 1964.” Along with the resolution was a defense of his actions at the fair written by Dr. Harrington while still in jail. He pleaded guilty, he said, “to a deliberate act of civil disobedience in the tradition of Henry David Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King.” “I believe,” he continued, “that the radical measure of civil disobedience is called for because I have sensed the growing despair of the Negro and Puerto Rican people with our white majority's indifference and prejudice. We are so patient, so content with their hardships, iniquities and lack of opportunity.” He warned that “unless there is an awakening of the white conscience very soon, we shall find our community divided in conflict along racial lines with the bridges burned beyond rebuilding.” Dr. Harrington explained why he “sat down in a puddle of mud on the cold concrete” at the entrance to the New York City Pavilion. “The opening of the World's Fair was an opportunity,” he said, “to point out the contrast between the world of possibility and the grim world of reality, for the fair presents a false picture of present American civilization, the glitter without the grime, the magnificence without the miser.” He said that the fair, which is “proclaimed to be a portent of peace through understanding, was actually built by labor unions still, in fact, largely segregated and inwhich there is as yet neither peace nor understanding of the issue of human brotherhood.” He called for Christians to become more intensely involved in the civil rights movement. When asked by a jailer why so many arrested at the fair's opening day had recorded that they had no religion, he said, “My answer was to hang my head in shame. Where were our religious young people, and why were only the nonreligious prepared to pay a price for their faith?” He went on: “I will speak, urge, encourage, organize and when these do not produce results, I will object, condemn and, if necessary, obstruct and disobey. I will do so because I love New York and want her to be my pride, and because I believe that without justice the people perish.'

464-> CIGARETTE TAX YIELD DECREASES IN STATE
ALBANY, May 14 (AP)—Cigarette‐tax collections in New York State slumped again in April after having made what appeared to be a recovery from the cancer scare. The State Tax Department reported today that last month's yield from the package tax was $10,510,385, compared with $11; 350,190 for the corresponding month last year. The decrease was 6½ per cent. If a downward trend continues through the fiscal year, it could cost the state more than $8 million in tax revenue and throw Governor Rockefeller's budget out of balance. April was the first month of the 1964–65 fiscal year. A department spokesman said he assumed the decline was “still part of the fallout” from last January's Federal Government report branding cigarette smoking as a hazard to health. He said that delay in depositing some receipts might account for a minor part of the April decrease but that this could not be determined readily. Cigarette‐tax collections eased in January, after the report on smoking was issued, then plummeted 18.3 per cent in February. The March report indicated there had been a sharp recovery, to $8,549,764, compared with the $8,595,584 recorded for March, 1963. In drafting his narrowly balanced $2.9 billion budget last January, Governor Rockefeller said that, because of uncertainty over the effect of the report on smoking, he was not counting on the usual increase in cigarette‐tax revenue, and used the same $127 million estimate as for fiscal 1963–64 The budget allowed for a surplus of only $1 million.

465-> ART NOTES: PATRON; Industrialist Enlarges Puerto Rico's Best—and: Only—Art Museum
NOW under way in Ponce, Puerto Rico, is a handsome new$,1,500,000 building to house the country's only art museum, established just five years ago by industrialist Luis Ferre. Designed by Edward Durell Stone, the new struc‐ture wilh replace a colonialstyle masnsion in the heart of Ponce, currently straining at the .seams with the Ferre collection. Among the 400 odd items,assembled over the last 10 years by Mr. Ferre with the guidance of Julius Held, professor of art history at Columbia, are outstanding examples of Renaissance and baroque art, European and American work of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, and an extensive Spanish group. Two years ago; the collection wasenrichedkythe gift of 12 old masters from the Samuel Kress foundation. seum mainly because Puerto Rico had none. “We felt that great European art should be brought to Puerto Rico,” says Mr. Ferre. “We've emphasized quality rather than names, and we hope later to acquire Impressionist and modern works.” Scheduled for late 1965 completion, the new building is designed in “subtropical” style to blend with its environment Its first floor will have an art library and lecture room, plus exhibit space. Seven galleries for permanent display of paintings will occupy the second floor. Outdoors, there'll be a small open‐air theater and a sculpture garden. Mr. Ferre already has plans for expansion —in short order, he says, there should be a new art school right next door. HASTE A bit breathlessly (the big show opens June 20), the Venice Biennale Committee has decided to mount a special, large‐scale exhibition of works from leading contemporary museums throughout the world. Titled “Today's Art in Museums,” the special show will consist of some 400 works, to be housed in the Biennale's Central Pavilion. The committee has asked nineteen top contemporary museunms to submit 20 examples of painting and sculpture selected from works purchased since 1950 In New York, the Guggenheim Museum was tapped; others include London's Tate, Stockholm's Modern Museum, Berlin's National Gallery, Amsterdam's Stedelijk, Rio's Modern Museum, Munich's Bayerische Staatsgemaeldesammlungen. Guggenheim Vice President Harvey Arnason says his museum's prize Pollack and deKooning specimens are out on loan and couldn't be included. But artists, both European and American, whose canvasses have been dispatched include William Baziotes, Sam Francis, Adolph Gottlieb, Philip Guston, Albert Jensen, Conrad Marea Relli, Lud Sander and Pierre Soulages. The Guggenheim put its foot down on sending sculpture—too much fuss at this late date. In town recently was Shinichi Segui, the Japanese art critic and prime mover behind thebig Picasso show opening in Tokyo next Saturday. Lenders have come through with 170 works, Mr. Segui reports, including 40 froin the U.S., 10 from Russia, 2 fetched up by the Czechs from a cubist cache in the National Gallery of Prague, and no less than 58 from one of the big Picasso coliectors, Picasso himself. Mr. Segui, a youngish (37), bespectacled and brisk expoet who strayed happily into art criticism a dozen years ago, says he is on the board of several Japanese museums, lectures on art history at Tokyo's Tama University, has published 10 books and a spate of articles. A forthcoming book on Picasso will be published here, and he plans a couple of American exhibits in Japan next year — maybe Mark Tobey and Franz Kline. Before his New York visit, Mr. Segui stopped by to see Picasso in the south of France, gift‐bearing a clutch of Japanese brushes. At Picasso's request, he showed him (with a ballpoint pen) how to write his name in Japanese. Spurning the ballpoint, Picasso seized a brush and worked away furiously, discarding sheet after sheet ' of paper. What finally came out, says Segui, was a lovely mutation—a string of classic Japanese calligraphy with an accent that was pure Picasso. SPIKED Heels — the stiletto kind worn by women visitors—are once again causing a clatter in museum circles. Their devastating impact on pubiic floors is reviewed by museum consultant John Davis Hatch in the May issue of Museum News. "Flooring, carpeting and even stone do not escape the power of the heel," says Mr. Hatch, pointing out the spread of heel‐pox in museums throughout the world. It's the fault of fashion; researchers have found that a 110‐lb. lady on modish needle heels (with a surface area of ¼ inch) can exert a pressure equal to nearly one ton per square inch of floor. Mr. Hatch's concern is shared by James J. Rorimer, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and longtime foe of the stylish spike. “Dreadful,” says Mr. Rorimer. “Women sometimes trip in heel‐holes made by others. The Met has recently had to do over wood flooring, and replace tiling uptown at the Cloisters, ruined by the pressure of heels.” A partial solution—providing heel cups of plastic or rubber for spike‐heeled visitors, or even turning them away—is now being tried by a number of smaller galleries. But that won't work for museums with mass attendance. “The real solution,” says Mr. Rorimer firmly, “is a change in shoe styles.” So serious is the topic that museum directors are hoping to thrash it out thoroughly at the American Association of Museums convention in St. Louis this month. “Whistler's Mother,” the famed portrait by James McNeill Whistler sent here by the Louvre last February for a tour of U.S. cities, will settlein from June 10 to June 30 at Washington's National Gallery of Art. It will then be a stone's throw from “Whistler's Father,” a painting of Maj. George Washington Whistler believed also to have been done by son James. The painting is now stashed away in a storage area of Washington's Freer Gallery of Art, which exhibits it from time to time in its main galleries. A black‐and‐white half length oil on wood, the portrait isn't signed or dated, but it belongs to the original Whistler collection which the gallery's founder, Charles L. Freer, bought in Iarge part from the painter himself. It's an early effort, says the Freer, and nothing to be ashamed of. But those who have seen it report that on canvas, at least, Major Whistler is very much out classed by his famous mate. As part of U.S. festivities preceding the Biennale opening, dancer Merce Cunningham and his troupe will perform at Venice's Fenice Opera House the night of June 18. . . . The Spaeth Foundation says it, not Harvard as widely reported, has commissioned sculptor Jacques Lipchitz to do a bronze head of the late John F. Kennedy, with Mrs. Kennedy making the final decision as to its placement. . . . The Art Dealers Association of America will stage its second annual summer show at the Parke‐Bernet Galleries from June 23‐Aug. 1. . . . Gymnasium I, a benefit art exhibit and sale; will be held by the Henry Street Settlement, 301 Henry Street, June 10‐21. . . .

467-> In The Nation; Significance of Wisconsin Primaries
WASHINGTON, April 8 — The only accurate poll is an election, and yesterday's voting in Wisconsin was an election in the opening phase. Since the candidacy of Governor Wallace of Alabama in the Democratic primary provided the only outlet for a protest against the pending Federal equal rights bill and the pressures used by some of its supporters, his capture of more than 33 per cent of the party vote demonstrates that this protest is considerable and is continental rather than merely Southern in scope. The additional fact that Governor Wallace is, as Senator Jordan of North Carolina remarked, a “bad image” of this protest, because of the demogogic character of his resistance to final Federal court orders, makes the vote he acquired in Wisconsin significant as a factor for national politicians to reckon with. This significance cannot be dissipated, as the bill's ardent advocates were busily doing today, by citing that more than 75 per cent of the total vote in both primaries were cast for candidates who endorse the measure in its entirety — Governor Reynolds, Democrat, and Representative Byrnes, Republican. A protesting minority of 25 per cent could swing the national election against the party it believes is the more likely to impose extreme Federal measures to compel conformity. The significance of the protest vote—in the state which supplied Grant with the Iron Brigade and the Republican party with the Progressive movement—for a Deep South 100 per cent racial segregationist cannot be explained away, either, by the Wisconsin primary cross‐over. Doubtless there were Republicans who voted for Wallace in the Democratic primary to embarrass the Opposition. But this is a tactic which is employed mostly by the professionals in both parties: rugged individualism is the trait of the generality of Republican and Democratic voters in Wisconsin. And if Wallace, who swore he would have to be removed physically from the anti‐integration barricade he mounted at the university doors in Alabama, and then moved aside at the show of a Federal court writ, could attract the protest vote he did, how much greater it conceivably could have been for a respected symbol of the protest such as Senator Russell or Senator Byrd of Virginia? The hypothesis is sounder than any advanced by the all‐out advocates of the equal rights bill in their effort to disparage the support for Wallace. One of the guarantees of the First Amendment is “the right of the people ... to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” There are sections in the pending Federal legislation—notably the public accommodations and “equal employment opportunity” provisions—which create new “grievances” by infringing long‐established rights of property and individual freedom of association in the remedies they propose for the long‐practiced infringement of the rights of another group of the people. In the Wisconsin primaries, the only available instrument of petition was Wallace, since both Governor Reynolds and Representative Byrnes support the bill without restrictive amendment. But in weighing the significance of his vote, it should not be overlooked that his was also the only voice raised by a primary candidate against the excesses of the pressures used by Negro leaders and their followers to get the equal rights bill legislated in the form passed by the House, if even stronger compulsions cannot be written into it. These pressures, intensified by the internal power contest among the Negro leaders, have included: Militant violations of local laws still affirmed as constitutional. Illegal obstruction of offices where Government is conducted. Mob demonstrations to prevent school and other public authorities from enforcing their legal decrees. Impudent threats of “direct action,” implying violence, if the United States Senate by a specified date does not approve the equal rights bill as introduced. The Negro leaders would do well to ponder the Wallace vote in Wisconsin as a warning against the continuation of these tactics that they cannot wisely disregard as an isolated local symptom, limited to a few communities where citizens of Polish extraction are numerous. And, regardless of what they are saying today, professional politicians in both parties are refiguring the voting percentages.

469-> A ‘Silent Minister’ Speaks Up; A pastor in a small Louisiana town answers the charge that the Southern clergy has ‘failed its duty’ on segregation.
KENTWOOD, La. IAM one of those exotic creatures, the Southern minister. I don’t know that I am either typical or untypical, but because most people haven’t known a person like myself, and the Southern minister is a national topic of discussion (as in “Silent White Ministers of the South” in the April 5 issue of this magazine) I would like to contribute to the dialogue by telling of my life and work. I am 34, born to white parents, a seminary graduate; I have been a Methodist minister for 12 years. My value structure is a belief that God is our Father, that every person is a child of God and my brother; that the Biblical expression of the church as the Body of Christ finds contemporary expression as the Responsible Society. I believe that salvation in this life is in terms of the fulfillment of personality. I believe that we must destroy the evils represented in segregation, but I am committed to the much larger social ideals of the Methodist Social Creed, and I am inclined to view my own success or failure as a responsible person more in terms of this larger social concern than just of civil rights. I was taught from childhood not to mumble when I recited “with liberty and justice for all.” I am a pastor in a Southern town of 2,700 people, one third of them Negroes. It is a rural community only five miles from the Mississippi state line; the dairy and pulpwood are our economic life. We have integrated neighborhoods because the white people built houses on the back of their property for the Negro "help". We also have a 'Negro "quarter", and some of the houses are above average for this community. Even after having lived here for some time, I still do not know whether some of the unpainted shacks in the main section of town have white or Negro residents. THE Negroes in this community have been voting for years and are popularly credited with having the balance of local political power. Two of my church members were brought into Federal court for their part in the rioting at Ole Miss. I live only 26 miles from where a Methodist minister signed a newspaper statement, preached one sermon, had his tires slashed and accepted the offer of a church in California. Occasionally I read articles critical of the lack of sermons on integration in Southern pulpits, implying that if we all simultaneously preached a sermon series in favor of integration the whole problem of attitude would be solved. There are times when there has to be a public confrontation—as when there was some initial cheering of the news of the death of President Kennedy—and on that Sunday at 11 A.M. there was. However, I’ve come to the opinion that, if a man wants to be effective and not just relieve a guilty conscience, he ought “to do something,” that he has to find other ways than relying on his oratorical ability. A few days ago I was going through my sermon files and came across a sermon I had preached in my first pastorate, in a church just five miles from Mansfield, Tex., where, you will remember, there was a riot over integrating the school. That sermon, as I re‐read it, lacked a great deal as a homiletic discourse, but Martin Luther King Jr. wouldn’t have found it very disappointing. I’ve preached some in this vein, but the thing is that I’ve never moved anyone's opinion with it. The response I’ve gotten is that I was berating the congregation from the privileged sanctuary of the pulpit when they couldn’t answer back. AND so I have had to come to terms with the limitations of the minister's role. I read articles critical of the minister for not giving leadership to his community. Does anyone really believe that the community in general and the power structure in particular will reverently bow their heads in obedience if a pastor tells them what their attitudes and actions on a given course of action should be? Our society just doesn’t accord that kind of power to ministers; it hasn’t since the time of the Puritans. There is, of course, the power of personal persuasion, and I and most other ministers do not fully take advantage of this opportunity. But if I, for instance, differ sufficiently and strongly enough with my congregation to tell them they are all headed for hell if they don’t change their value structure, they, being Americans, are the kind of folk who will reply that if I am so keen on the place, I can go there myself. I wish I didn’t have this limitation, for my social concern extends beyond racial matters, to organized gambling, alcohol, political immorality, mental health, birth control, relationships in foreign affairs. There are a great many areas of social concern where I wish our society gave me the right to speak with authority. MY position is conditioned in part by the fact that I have to understand. why the segregationist believes as he does. I have spent hours listening to persons spout sense and nonsense about race, trying to convey through my attention that I valued them as persons and wished to understand their position Through this means I hoped to break through some of their walls of insecurity so that they could work through their fears I hoped that they would afterwards be able to respond to me, valuing me as a person and trying to understand why I differed with them. However, listening to understand a segregationist, in the hope that his position can be modified, also affects onself. It is easy to assume that the segregationist is acting from insecurity, unconscious fears, rejection—and he is— but he is also acting from fact and reason. SOME of the most hardened segregationists I have known in my pastorates have been men from the North. They have told me that they came here with all the unconscious assumptions that the South was wrong, but that as they had had Negroes working on their farms or in their shops, they had reversed their positions; the same facts and reasons that influence the Southern segregationist had influenced them. I have puzzled long and hard on how to deal with emotions that are wrong, but that aspect of the problem is not nearly as hard to deal with as the situation where the reasoning is right. I take my stance as having a ministry of reconciliation. This means having two faces and it makes for personal difficulties. When I am dealing with the segregationist, I try to show him where he is wrong; but when I am dealing with a person from another section of the country, I try to show him where the segregationist is right. AN example is voter registration. I say to the segregationist that every American has the right to have the laws applied equally. On the other hand, to use a local illustration, we have a good many votes bought at election time, both white and black. A case of liquor in a precinct where there is heavy Negro registration will generally swing that election box, and men who are in a position to know usually would rather buy a Negro than a white vote because the former is regarded as more reliable. (One local legend has it that when one side delivered pints, the other side retaliated by delivering fifths, and the pints were honorably returned unopened!) It is common for a Negro who belongs to some organization to come to the polls with a voting list he has gotten in the mail; it only contains numbers to vote for—he doesn’t even know the names of candidates. If a man wants to learn how the Negroes are being voted, he finds some Negro he knows and gives him $5 for a look at the list; then a pint is given to each person coming in to change from, say, No. 6 to No. 7 on his list. It is not completely illogical for a segregationist to oppose the registration of a mass of very poor (therefore more open to temptation) and almost illiterate people. He simply regards larger voter registration as raising the cost of winning an election and making it more difficult for a person to win who is above the purchase of votes. The fact that the Southern minister lived in the area before the issue of segregation reached a boiling point inevitably influences his position. He can remember when conditions were not as an outsider sees them now. Once, 10 years ago, half the guests at our Negro high‐school graduation were white; now there are none. Ten years ago I would have invited the Negro Methodist choir to sing at our revival; now if one of them came, there would be real trouble at the door of the church. When I was a youth going to church camps, we had a Negro discussion‐group leader; now if a Negro preacher were going to be in a camp, not a single family would allow their children to attend. Ten years ago we were having integrated statewide meetings of the Wesley Foundations (the college campus ministry); they had to be broken off, and only in the last two years, and with the greatest circumspection, have we begun again, but it will take a long time to get back where we were. A SHORT time ago I was walking with a fine churchman who is a segregationist; as we passed an elderly Negro, he unselfconsciously said, “Good morning, uncle.” That man's son would never think of doing that; the easy‐going goodwill is gone. We have simply lost ground in the South in respect to goodwill. It may be that this is necessary in order to clear the ground for healthier things, but the Southern minister is conscious, nevertheless, that there are things in regard to Negroes that he can no longer do. There are ruptures of relationships: 25 years ago every white child in the grade school here had Negro playmates; today there are very few white children in school who even know the name of a Negro child. Ten years ago (at least in the circles in which I, as a minister, move) it was part of our way of life for a man to feel a responsibility toward a Negro. If a family was hungry, you gave them food; you put $10 in the collection being made up for the Negro church or a hospital bill or burial; you signed his note at the bank if you knew him well; if he was out of work, you gave him a job if you possibly could. Today the same man couldn’t care less. A pastor is conscious of these things, and when he wants to move ahead to put the evils of segregation behind him, he knows that real progress is more than forcing a Negro child into a white classroom or the number of new voter registrations. I want real progress in terms of human relationships, and the stance I take is often different from that of those who are concerned with civil rights. I AM willing even to bear the stigma of being a silent minister, because it, too, is one of the things I can do. There was a time a few years ago when every time I went into a home (and this is true of the friends I have), there was a demand made that I state my position on segregation. This is very much less common now. People have learned that, even under the restraint of being a guest in their home, the pastor can be pressed into stating his convictions in much greater detail than they would ever have wanted to know. By and large, when a new minister comes to town, people assume he is for integration. I had a rather peculiar experience of this. Shortly after I came to this community, I was stopped on the street by an elderly Negro. He asked if I was the new pastor, and I automatically reached towards my pocket to respond to a “touch.” Instead he said, “I want to thank you for coming to town to help us.” I had never seen him before, and don’t know his name, but he assumed that my role was to help them. Negro and white people generally make the same assumption, in my experience. The very fact that I exist is as a sign to many, just as when Jeremiah walked the streets of Jerusalem with his ox yoke, and it rebukes many. Let me say in praise of my people, that though they know I oppose them in an area of their most serious dread, they still invite me into their homes and entrust the religious education of their children to me. I can preach in the field of social concerns. I could do it as the distinguished former pastor of Galloway Memorial Methodist Church in Jackson, Miss., did: preach a great sermon and leave the state for another job. I could preach so, but although I would get some private support, I have every assurance that the next Sunday I would have a congregation consisting of one lay person. Instead I preach by indirection, though this is called cowardly by some. I recognize, however, that the Negro protest and civil rights are but the passing parade. THERE will come a time when all this will be known only through the history books by my grandchildren, but there will be some other burning issue, and the ideals of brotherhood, the open society and the possibility of fulfillment are part of the continuing scene. I can state the basic truths and theological foundations that underlie them, and though my congregation will not be large, there will still be a congregation to hear me. I can work with the emotions that underlie the fears of the segregationist. I once knew a man who had a very limited education and a very limited job and who was deep ly insecure. He was not open to an intellectual approach. I valued him as a person and accepted him as being of real worth. He moved slowly, but he did move. A one‐to‐one approach is not fast enough, but if it is what you can do, you have to do it. I can support the Methodist Church. I know my church is moving steadily toward full integration. We can move slowly and try to carry all that we can with us, or we can move swiftly and leave tens of thousands behind. It is not just a matter of wanting to carry all the people we can on the rolls or securing all the funds we can get: it would be a calamity for society as a whole if we tore its fabric. When the time of testing comes, and men bring their guns to town, do we want as many men as we can get inside the framework of the church or outside it? I appreciate what the Roman Catholic Church has done in the area of integration. There are some things that a priest can do, though, that I can’t. He has an authority system that can make his judgment felt whether on integration or birth control. I have none. All I can do is persuade my people to love their church and trust it, and I try to carry my people with it. I can try to get to know Negroes here to establish communication. This is not as easy as it sounds. The actual power structure of the Negro community is different and does not include the persons it would be most natural for me to get to know—the preachers and the teachers. I am not even sure what I can specifically accomplish by this effort, for the Negro community does not need vocal represen tation; it already has complete access to the city council and is received courteously. The thing that seems most needed is an attack on those things that make Negroes unacceptable to the white community: the drinking, gambling, fighting (the all‐toofamiliar pattern of having to get your worker out of jail on at least one Monday morning every month), illegitimate births ( a friend told me, “My maid is really a lovely person, but she has no husband, and she keeps having babies periodically”), irresponsibility (the week of the violence in New York City over jobs, our welfare worker called on a new relief applicant, the father of six, who told her he had quit his job at a box factory “because I got tired of working”). To do what needs to be done to make genuine advancement toward a better racial climate and living standard, I would have to move into the Negro church parsonage and take over the job there. MEANWHILE I will do what can be done, since no Negro can speak to white people as their pastoral leader—any more than .1 could really be accepted by the Negroes as their pastoral leader. I will keep pointing out to the members of my community their own responsibility to keep infact the very qualities they hold in contempt. I have three alternatives: I can preach my whole convictions—with the realization that the Bishop will have to find another place for me. It is a real alternative and I may do it. Sometimes when some group comes into the South and does something dramatic and all I can do is try to handle sullen relationships, I feel like the dogface looking at the flyboys going over to their hour of danger and then home to a soft bed while he has to settle back in his foxhole. THERE are times when I would like to say what I think and get out. I can also give in to my temptation to become completely disgusted with the whole thing, as when I read some demand that I regard as completely unrealistic and unwarranted. Occasionally I feel embittered when some church leader makes a big headline splash and the only result that I can see is that my people take out their resentments on the nearest Methodist Church. His only inconvenience may be to have to stand still “for one more picture, please,” but when the pledges are cut and we can’t come up with the Benevolences, it affects my retirement pay and I’ll be paying for it after he is dead and buried. I also wonder if all the agitation really is accomplishing anything. One civil‐rights worker managed to get a school strike in a nearby city and one of the tenth‐grade boys dropped out of school. He went to a man, a Methodist Sunday School teacher, who is the assistant manager of a chain store and asked for a job. When he was asked what job he wanted, he replied, “I’d like your job.” After swallowing his anger, the assistant manager patiently explained what was involved in qualifying for his job and urged the boy to go back to school and at least complete his high‐school education. There were a number of these dropouts and I wonder who else showed a sense of responsibility toward them ? SOMETIMES when things get really sticky, and one of my friends is right in the middle, and I read a big, brave statement on the situation down here, coupled with a charge about the ministers’ failure to do their duty, I feel like chucking the whole thing. What does such a person know, a thousand miles from where he can get hurt? It is a very tempting choice: to try to find a rich and fulfilling ministry, as completely divorced from the entire issue as I can make it. On the other hand, I can try to stick it out as best I can and settle for half a loaf—or even present just a pinch off one slice to my Lord. As things stand now, I propose, like Grant, to fight it out on this line if it takes me all summer—or the rest of my life.

470-> Madrid Restaurants Could Be Better; Need Seen to Improve De Luxe Spots, but Costs Are Low
MADRID. THE Jockey restaurant, by far the best known of those in Madrid, is an ultimate example of a successful establishment, the sum of which is better than its parts. The decor, with its wood paneling and portraits of horses, is nothing to bewitch the eye; there are scores of restaurants throughout the world equally as arresting. The food is good but it is not in all respects haute cuisine nor is it elegant Spanish. The service is admirably enthusiastic but far from polished. And yet to dine at the Jockey is an agreeable experience. The restaurant has frequently been compared to New York's “21,” and the comparison is notably valid. In the afternoon, the Jockey is a rendezous of businessmen; in the evening it is one of the city's most fashionable restaurants. At either meal reservations are more often than not essential. The public dining area of the Jockey is an L‐shaped affair, somewhat small and with tables compactly spaced. The reception is warm and the preprandial drinks, whether cocktails or sherries, are excellent. As in the menus of most Spanish restaurants of whatever genre, that of the Jockey is a la carte. It is fascinating to go to the source of origin of any dish, whether the souce is imagined or real, and Madrid is at least the spiritual home of consommé madrilène, which in most of the world is merely jellied consommé flavored with tomato juice. At the Jockey it is prepared by spooning a purée of fresh tomato into a cup and adding a rich consommé with natural gelatin. The result is altogether appetizing. Most of the soups at the Jockey are, in fact, creditable whether a rich, gratinésed onion with cheese, or cold vichyssoise with chives. The cream of crab is delicious. Of several entrees sampled recently at the restaurant, a serving of veal Cordon Bleu, a dish that seems to be popular in many first‐class restaurants in Spain, came closest to the ideal. This is bzreaded veal stuffed with cheese and fine Spanish ham, and at the Jockey it was sauteed until golden as opposed to the deep‐frying that is found in less concienstious establishments. A serving of prawns or European shrimp in champagne sauce Was enormously palatable although the sauce tasted a touch too heavily of pure hollandaise. Similarly, the sauce for chicken a la champagne was too thick and too dark for serious accolades. The Jockey's waiters have a Latin, friendly temperament that is a joy, but they scatter silver about the table with the same abandon that one is accustomed to — or rather resigned to—in New York By New York standards the Jockey's menu is most reasonably priced. Several of the entrees cost less than $2 and the most expensive are rarely more than $5. A fairly decent Spanish wine may be had for $1.50 a bottle. ● There are several sumptuous restaurants in Madrid, among them La Puerta de Moros, which is housed in a former ducal palace. It is a relatively new restaurant and the appoint. ments are something to behold. There are magnificent ceilings in a city that is noted for its ceilings; carpeted floors, lavish draperies in red and gold, and marble fireplaces. The waiters in white ties are impeccably dressed in this mansion of many rooms. La Puerto de Moros is impressively crowded by 11 o'clock each evening but the food can be impressively ordinary. The menu is extensive and is French by inspiration. There are the usual tournedos Rossini or sauteed filet of beef with fole gras on toast: fish meunière, and lobster thermidor. Of numerous dishes ordered recently, the quiche Lorraine came off best. The cheese custard arrived at the table hot and in a delicate pastry. Otherwise, a cazuela of sea food was contained in a heavy sauce overly salted, and steak bordelaise was mediocre both in texture and taste. The food at La Puerta is not bad, merely undistinguished. There is a touch of embarrassment involved in any serious criticism of Madrid's de luxe restaurants. The costs are far below those of Faris or New York and the food frequently compares favorably with its New York counterparts. All things are relative, however, and there is room for improvement in Spain. As a long‐time resident of Spain has pointed out, Madrid is not noted for its paella. For that, they sey, one must bo to Valencia. The beat place for paello in Madrid may be, nonetheless, th erestaurant Riscal. This is an unpretentious restaurant with poorly painted walls, striped canvas‐back chairs and a fine trio that sings romantic Spanish ballads to the twang of guitars. There is a 25minute wait for the paella and it comes to the table hot. The food—saffron rice, chicken and sea food—ls deftly served and it is gratifying. The salads are simple and good, too. The cost of the paella is 78 pesetas or about $1.25 a serving.

471-> THE BIBLE THROUGH TV EYES
ALLENTOWN, PA. WAY from the camera's rigid control, Dr. Hagen Staack becomes what he basically is—a minister who happens to be a college professor who happens to have his own television show. As the one‐man cast of “Frontiers of Faith,” a series on Old Testament personalities, the theologian‐performer says he is grappling with the task of making people realize The Bible is something more than a best‐seller. He calls it “the most bought and least read book in the world.” Off‐screen, his precise, accented English becomes less stentorian. Words and gestures quicken and darkrimmed glasses lose their barrenness. On television he is not so much concerned with projecting his own image as he is in humanizing Biblical characters. He became convinced his strategy was right when a student approached him after a telecast analysis of Samson and told him he liked the program because he was never aware Samson really existed. Americans, he believes, are living in a time of “artificial sacredness of Scripture.” As a Lutheran professor of religion at Muhlenberg College since 1954, he finds it more and more difficult to make classroom allusions to parables. “They simply don't know what I'm talking about. As for television, we have religious programs, dramas and discussions, all quite lively, attractive and up to date. But strangely enough,” he says with the wry understatement which marks his Sunday afternoons on the National Broadcasting Company, “we should discuss, once in a while, The Bible.” Dr. Staack's students tell him when they like a program. “They very frequently say if it is not so good, too. They don't like it too slow. I move and lecture very fast in class, but if I did that for television no camera could catch me.” Ordained in Germany's Underground Confessing Church, he was drafted into the German Army in 1939 and sent to the Russian front. “It was a good way to get rid of dissenters,” he says, reflecting on his six years as a prisoner of war. The year 1949 found him working on a book at Princeton University. He was invited to preach here at a bilingual parish and after a brief trip home to Germany, he returned to stay in this Pennsylvania German community. His duties at Muhlenberg, and at Temple University, where he teaches a graduate course in geology, came later. So did two supply pastorates. “I don't think a man should be permitted to teach religion in a college without being actively involved in the work of the church. It is difficult to talk about evil if you have never seen someone in despair, or had to scrape money together, or never got your hands dirty.” Similarly, he covets the personal touch of the classroom. “I can see whether they've caught what I said. If they look dumb I repeat it a second time. In television you have only lenses, big glass eyes, looking at you. And what can you know about a man sitting in his living room who's just eaten his lunch ? I deliver my lectures into the eyes of the cameramen.” The idea of treating his television audienceas a classroom came to him after he was selected for the first “Frontiers of Faith” series last season. At 50 he was the youngest of auditioning clergy who were seasoned by local television experience. “I was the only one who had only a measly Ph.D., and the oldest self‐sustaining radio program in the United States.” He was sent to the Atlanta Protestant Radio and Television Center, and told how to act. “After a while I thought, ‘I'm not going to do what they tell me. I'm not an actor. I'm a teacher and what I can do well is teach a class.”’ General response from an estimated audience of three million has been good so far. His classroom Nielson rating, high even before he entered television, is healthier than ever. Moaned one co‐ed who has been thwarted in attempts to enroll in his class, “I've tried, but I've just never been able to get in.” N.B.C. has signed him up for a third series. In 1965 his lectures will deal with the Prophets. Critical notes he makes while watching himself are being studied to discover improvements. “I must rely more on word than gesture. Perhaps someone will come along who can do this thing better than I with new approaches, but I don't see them yet.” Once he received a letter from a former student, which said: “Doc, you haven't changed the script very much.” Dr. Staack replied, “That's because the text hasn't changed.”

472-> Christopher Hagen Is Fiance Of Nancy Cobleigh Johannsen
PALM BEACH, Fla., May 9—A summer wedding is planned by Miss Nancy Cobleigh Johannsen and Christopher Hagen. Dr. and Mrs. Marco Johannsen of Palm Beach and Cashiers, N.C., have announced the engagement of his daughter to the son of Mr. and Mrs. Milton Hagen of New York. The couple plan to be married in the summer. Miss Johannsen attended Miss Hewitt's Classes in New York and graduated from St. Timothy's School, Stevenson, Md. She is a senior at Wellesley College. The prospective bride was presented to society in 1960 at a supper dance given here by Dr. and Mrs. Johannsen and at the Debutante Cotillion and Christmas Ball in New York. She was honored at the Debutante Ball of the New York Junior League of which she is a provisional member. Her grandparents were the late Mr. and Mrs. Friedrich Wilhelm Claus Johannsen of Hamburg, Germany, and the late Mr. and Mrs. Charles O'Boyle of New York. The future bridegroom attended Trinity School in New York, graduated from the Hill School, Pottstown, Pa., and from Princeton University. He is a student at the Columbia University School of Business Administration. Mr. Hagen is the grandson of the late Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin Lewis of New York, and of the late Mr. and Mrs. Frederic Hagen of Morristown, N.J.

473-> YOUNG VETERAN IN STARRY QUEST; Natalie Wood Reaches Higher for Success In Her Vocation
HOLLYWOOD. URISTS among Hollywood handicappers considered the most unalloyedly popular film actress in the world today to be the young woman of Russian extraction who calls herself Natalie Wood. By “popular” is meant, as always, the one most likely to induce screengoers to buy tickets. The purists, however, make clear their point that no part of Miss Wood's appeal is based on her extracurricular activities. With all factors in, they bow in some degree, to the accepted, if unprovable, conclusion that Elizabeth Taylor is queen. What they do insist on is that by any standards Miss Wood is No. 2, and that she will be No. 1 before the year is out. Miss Wood herself would be the last to know about that —and the first to care. This improbable offset arises from the fact that four years ago, when she began her dogged progression to super‐stardom, she stoped looking around her. A spate of extraneous publicity at that time, stemming largely from magazines devoted to the cult of personality, was not only damaging her projected image as a serious actress but also making her acutely self‐conscious. To her dismay, Miss Wood found herself in the role of some sort of Hollywood swinger whose night‐club appearances were taking precedence over what she was trying to do in front of a camera. She had become a celebrity of a distinctly dubious sort, a development that to her own selective intelligence was appalling. Her immediate reaction was a scattering of abortive lawsuits against publications which hadn't dreamed anyone cared that much, and the memory of which embarrasses her to this day. Presently she shifted to an inflexible policy of not talking to any periodical whose editorial approach struck her as less than relevant to her ends. The reward came when Elia Kazan, a selective shopper's darling, picked her for his lead in “Splendor in the Grass,” a motion picture that was going to lift her with one boost from the underbrush of her vocation into notable artistic stature. There followed “West Side Story,” a film in itself so roaringly successful that it conferred distinction by inference on everyone connected with it; “Gypsy,” a lesser effort but better for Natalie, who managed somehow not to be submerged in the pyrotechnics of Rosalind Russell, and her current “Love With the Proper Stranger,” for which she received another Academy nomination. (She got one for “Splendor” as well.) “I'm for her,” director Kazan declared not long ago. “She has a terrible desire for excellence.” “The thing I've had to learn,” Miss Wood said recently, “was to keep my eye off the people in the stands and my ears deaf to them. Oh, they matter—it's not that. Aah, do they ever matter! But I'm talking about the celebrity bit, the public figure. That's what doesn't matter—and anyone who's after nothing but celebrity is after nothing at all. Which is just what they'll wind up with. That part of it, the bow‐taking and the autograph albums, that's not an ambition, it's a day‐dream. Pure Walter Mitty. No, the thing is to put on blinkers and never take your eye off the ball. You do your work the best you can, you go home, you get up and do it all over again. There's nothing valid but that. Everything else is a foolish digression.” Natalie Wood was born Natasha Gurdin 25 years ago to Nicholas and Maria Kuleff Gurdin, who migrated here from Russia. The moppet Natalie, second of three daughters, became a child actress of some film identity but never at the star level. Still in her teens and at the height of her swinger phase, Natalie married actor Robert Wagner in late 1957, and divorced him in the summer of 1961. Subsequently alleged romances of hers, one in particular, have been bruited about in the bruit‐prone press but none accorded the stuff of permanence until the onset of theater heir Arthur Loew Jr., to whom she is engaged. The imminence of her marriage to Loew is accepted as a matter of course by everyone but Miss Wood who always prefixes her discussions of the subject with a carefully planted “if.” Like many blinkered careerists, Miss Wood has few avocational diversions, but those there are include sailing, retreating to the beach houses of friends and shopping for paintings or antiques. Other than this, her spare time is not spare. It is taken up with the endless spadework of films yet in gestation. Her next will be “Inside Daisy Clover,” the screen play being shaped by Gavin Lambert from his own novel. Then there is Rona, Inc. Rona, Inc., is one of two badges of accredited screen eminence that Miss Wood has garnered—you're nowhere till you're Inc. Rona was launched at about the same time as her present ascendancy and has to date been preoccupied mainly with real estate ventures. Just lately the company has shown a disposition to move into films. She is owner and president of Rona. Her other standard accolade was the pronouncement by a magazine recently that she makes a million dollars a year. Slightly less than half that figure is the nearest to it she's yet managed, though it's expected she will touch $600,000 this year. While it was at it, the same issue of the same magazine broke precedent of a sort by presenting Miss Wood, through an artful selection of photographs, as a sex figure. She is not particularly. What sets her apart, both on the screen and personally, more than anything else is the avidity of her small, waif‐like face with its large, hyper‐attentive eyes. Of course, that kind of appeal may have something to do with sex. But whether it does or not, it plainly has a great deaI to do with her exalted new rating on cinema's totem pole.

475-> The Auto Makers' Responsibility
The defeat in the New York State Legislature of proposals that would have set the first tire safety standards in the nation has been attributed to overt lobbying by the automotive and allied industries. State Senator Edward J. Speno, sponsor of the measure, has accused the industry of “bad faith,” and said that the car and tire companies block safety measures as a matter of standard operating procedure on the theory that they alone are the best judges of automotive safety equipment. Historically the record seems to bear him out. Many safety organizations have accused the auto makers of organized resistance to making cars safer, belatedly joining in safety campaigns only when legislative action is in the offing. The critics assert that Detroit undercuts suggestions for improvements by listening respectfully but doing nothing—or, as in the case of the tire safety legislation, actively resisting, even when one would think that sale of new tires would actually be promoted by establishment of minimal tire‐safety standards. The industry tends to place the major share of blame for the appalling highway death toll, which reached a new mark last year with 43,400 fatalities, to deficiencies in road design and to driver carelessness or incompetence. The car makers and their allies have always been afraid to admit that the product they are selling is inherently a highly dangerous instrument. The industry seems to think that to emphasize safety is only to awaken fears in the consumer's mind. It is willing to exploit the gullibility of a public that seems to prefer excessive horsepower and chrome trimmings to safety and simplicity when it comes to buying cars.

476-> THE COMMUNIST WORLD AND HOW IT LINES UP IN THE BATTLE BETWEEN MOSCOW AND PEKING; MOSCOW‐PEKING POWER STRUGGLE SPLITS THE COMMUNIST WORLD; Both Nations Are Locked in a Contest for Power, Influence and Prestige in the Bloc; Each Side's Attempts to Encourage Palace Revolts Serve to Increase the Bitterness
The Chinese‐Soviet conflict reached a new peak of verbal violence last week as Moscow and Peking publicly fired their heaviest polemical broadsides at each other. The Chinese called upon all Communists to repudiate Premier Khrushchev, whom Peking accuses of being the greatest Trotskyite of all time. The Russians accused the Chinese of conducting open warfare against true Communism and trying to impose the “cult of Mao Tse‐tung” upon the entire world. What lies behind these and other frenzied accusations that the former allies now hurl at each other? What is the real root of the mutual hatred so apparent in the violent wordy blasts Moscow and Peking have been exchanging since last summer? Many elements enter into and exacerbate the dispute, but the core is a contest for world power, influence and prestige. At the personal level this struggle is between Nikita S. Khrushchev and Mao Tse‐tung, each of whom would like to be the undisputed ruler and lawgiver of the Communist world, much as were Lenin and then Stalin from the nineteen‐twenties to the early nineteen‐fifties. More generally, the contest is between the Soviet Union and Communist China, whose rival nationalisms have ruptured what proved to be the fragile bonds of ideological unity that both sides claimed in the nineteen‐fifties would guarantee “eternal friendship.” Some comparatively recent history helps illuminate the nature of the struggle. From the formation of the Communist International shortly after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution to Stalin's death in 1953, the world Communist movement was essentially an instrument of Soviet foreign policy. The zigs and zags of the world Communist party line were ordered from Moscow in the light of Soviet national interest, and so great was Russian control that Communists the world over swallowed even such a horse pill as the 1939 Stalin‐ Hitler pact, convinced that what was good for the Soviet Union was automatically good for world Communism. With Stalin's death the situation changed abruptly for at least three reasons. First, none of Stalin's successors had his prestige or international authority. Second, there existed by the mid‐nineteen‐fifties roughly a dozen Communist‐ruled states and the leaders of each of them were increasingly aware that what was good for Moscow was not necessarily ideal for Peking or Warsaw or Bucharest. Finally, the successful defiance of Stalin by Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito had shown Communist leaders the world over that there was an earlier unsuspected alternative: national Communism. Premier Khrushchev and his associates made major concessions to nationalistic feelings among Soviet satellite nations after the 1956 Hungarian revolution, but in recent years they have been trying to reimpose Kremlin control of the world Communist movement. The Khrushchev effort since 1960 to destroy the Albanian Communist party leadership has been an unsuccessful attempt to enforce Moscow's claim to be the supreme power and doctrinal center of world Communism. The attempted coup against Albania failed because Communist China stands now as a rival claimant to world Communist leadership, and has been able to help the Albanians. In Mao Tse‐tung, Peking has a leader who claims the prestige due the man who brought the world's most populous nation under Communist rule. Neither side, of course, admits that its basic motivation is a desire for monopolistic power over the one‐third of humanity ruled by Communist parties and over the millions loyal to Communism in the free world. Each side asserts it is only its opponent that is animated by motives—an idea called in Communist jargon “great power chauvinism.” For its part, each side claims that it is moved only by a desire to preserve the purity of Marxism‐Lenin‐ ism and to safeguard that purity against the threat posed by the “revisionism,” “dogmatism,” Trotskyism and “petty bourgeois perversions” of its opponent. Thus much of the debate is conducted in an ideological vocabulary that might convince the naïve reader that the central questions are the correct interpretations of sentences Marx wrote a century ago or Lenin wrote a half‐century ago. But it takes no great penetration to see that a vast gulf often exists between each nation's ideological disputation and what it actually does. The Soviet Union, for example, seeks to project an image of being the great spokesman for peace in our time. Great ingenuity and industry have been shown by Premier Khrushchev's ideologists in digging out obscure quotations from Marx, Engels and Lenin designed to show that these past oracles of the Communist faith stood for peaceful conquest of the world through each Communist nation's demonstration that the system of government ownership of means of production and economic planning is superior to the “anarchy” of capitalism. This image was first put in the center of Soviet policy by Premier Khrushchev at the 20th congress of the Soviet Communist party in February, 1956. Millions of words have been written in Moscow to depict this devotion to peace and economic competition as the essence of Marxism‐Leninism in the mid‐twentieth century. But since that line was first promulgated the Soviet Union has used its troops and tanks to put down the Hungarian revolution in 1956, has threatened rocket intervention in the war over the Suez Canal that same year, has threatened to use its hydrogen bomb‐tipped missiles to turn various countries into “cemeteries,” has unilaterally renewed nuclear test explosions in the atmosphere and has tried to create bases for its missiles and nuclear weapons in Cuba. The patent discrepancies between Soviet words and actions have, of course, given the Chinese Communists valuable debating points that they have used effectively. Thus they have accused Premier Khrushchev of “adventurism” in putting Soviet missiles into Cuba and of “capitulationism” in withdrawing them upon receipt of President Kennedy's ultimatum. And the Chinese Communists have not been slow in pointing out the contradiction between Premier. Khrushchev's claims that he would prove the economic superiority of the Soviet Union and the fact that he has been able to provide bread for his people this last half‐year only by spending hundreds cf millions of dollars for grain purchased in the United States, Canada and elsewhere in the capitalist world. The Chinese Communists, on the other hand, seek to project an image of extreme, fundamentalist Communist devotion to revolutionary violence. Last week, for example, they demanded that the compro‐ mise statements of world Communist position adopted in 1957 and 1960 be revised to make violent revolution the basic method for seizing power in all countries. The Chinese quote Lenin and Stalin copiously to show that true Communism calls for maximum militancy against all capitalist nations. And Peking dismisses talk of the danger of nuclear destruction with declarations that nuclear weapons are but “paper tigers.” But if one looks at what Peking has been doing, rather than what it has been saying, a rather different picture of Communist China emerges. That different picture is of a nation that recognizes acutely the limitations put upon it by its lack of nuclear weapons and therefore resorts to force only against weaker powers, notably Tibet and India. Peking has never attempted directly to challenge the power of the United States Seventh Fleet in the Taiwan Strait and has never even tried to invade the tiny islands of Quemoy and Matsu, just off the Chinese mainland, let alone Taiwan itself. But an even more vivid contrast is provided by the discrepancy between Peking's verbal militancy and its sedulous wooing of major capitalist nations. The extremely cordial relations between France and Communist China now are ap‐ parently considered so important in Peking that the Chinese press “overlooked” any suggestion of neo‐colonialism in the recent French military intervention which saved the proParis Government of Gabon. Peking's wooing of Britain and Japan is also prominently visible these days. Several British trade exhibitions are to be held in Communist China during the next year or so, and Communist Chinese economic officials have been frequent visitors to Britain recently. No serious shadow clouds the present British position in Hong Kong, though Chinese verbal fury about, say, Portuguese colonialism in Angola is unrestrained. Similarly, in the case of Japan the Chinese Communists make much of the two countries' common cultural heritage, of the great influence Buddhism has exerted upon them both, of the fact that both peoples are nonwhite and of the mutual profitability of expanded trade. Peking's wooing of Pakistan also contradicts its verbal militancy. And when one examines the sources of the Chinese denunciations of the United States, one finds that the key element emphasized is the role of this country in preventing Communist China from gaining control over the Nationalist‐held areas. But this is hardly an issue having much bearing upon any Marxist or Leninist theory as such. Many similar examples can be cited of contradictions between both Soviet and Communist Chinese ideology and practice, but the point is plain: the leaders of each nation make practical decisions in the light of what each group considers to be its own and its national interests. The ideological positions advanced by Moscow and Peking are those each side thinks will gain the most adherents abroad, but neither Premier Khrushchev nor Mao Tsetung seems to show any belief that he need bring his nation's actions into conformity with the claimed ideological verities. The contest for power over world Communism is the kernel of the dispute, but a series of other, more limited issues further exacerbates the bitterness. One such factor is the anger each ruling group harbors over the other's effort to encourage palace revolutions aimed at deposing the rival clique. Thus the Soviet leaders in 1959 encouraged the Chinese Defense Minister, Marshal Peng Teh‐huai, in his abortive effort to challenge and overturn Mao's position. In 1961, the evidence suggests, Peking encouraged the purged Stalin lieutenant, Vyacheslav M. Molotov, to move against Premier Khrushchev by offering an alternative political line in a circular letter to members of the Soviet party's Central Committee. A second such source of tension arises from the Communist Chinese action a year ago in publicly raising the issue of the vast territories taken by Czarist Russia from China a century ago, territories Peking indicates it regards as having been unjustly stolen. A third factor is the bitter Chinese resentment over the Soviet failure to help Communist China become a nuclear power. The Chinese contend, without Soviet denial, that in 1959 Moscow reneged on a 1957 agreement to provide Peking with atomic bombs and technical aid for producing nuclear weapons. Finally, of course, there is the great anger of the Chinese at what they regard as deliberate Soviet economic sabotage. Chinese propaganda claims that the withdrawal of Soviet technical experts in August, 1960, and the steep drop in Soviet exports to China have played major roles in causing the great economic difficulties China has suffered in recent years. Against this background, it seems clear that the rift between Moscow and Peking is very serious indeed. Soviet Communist party Secretary Mikhail A Suslov notes last week that on virtually every major issue Communist China today stands opposed to the Soviet Union. What exists, in short, is a state of acute political warfare between the Soviet Union and China and their respective adherents. Moscow's military and economic aid to Peking ceased years ago and trade between them has dried up almost completely. The Chinese are chal‐lenging the Soviet Union on every possible front, forming a complex network not only of pro‐Chinese Communist parties but also of pro‐Chinese front groups, with emphasis upon winning support in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Moreover, after last week's exchange of attacks, both sides are on record as regarding the other group's leaders as enemies of true Communism who must be removed from power if the cause of Marxism‐Leninism is not to be irreparably damaged. The chances of near‐term resolution and ending of the conflict seem slight, at least as long as Mao Tse‐tung and Premier Khrushchev remain in their present positions of power. The Soviet Union last week disclosed something of the behindthe‐scenes efforts that have been made this last half year to ease the dispute, end polemics and resume negotiation—but all these efforts ended in failure. One prime cause of this failure seems to be the Chinese Communists' belief that they are gaining strength, that the Soviet peace‐making efforts are the fruit of Moscow weakness and that with the passage of time a Chinese victory over the Soviet side is certain. In their defiance of the Soviet Union, of course, the Chinese Communists are showing implicitly their confidence that no major East‐West war is likely in the foreseeable future. As in the case of France's growing independence of the United States, the much more violent and hate‐filled Chinese divergence from Soviet policy would be unthinkable if either of the dissidents feared any serious military challenge to its future existence in the period just ahead. The shattering of the monolithic image of world Communism has had and is still having profound effects in many parts of the world. Within the Communist nations themselves, the result seems to have been a further disillusionment with ideology and a strengthening of nationalism. Many of the people of the Soviet Union, China and Eastern Europe see clearly behind the ideological verbiage the clash of national interests In many parts of the free world the exposure of the split and of the bitter hatred between Moscow and Peking has served to weaken Communism. In many places much Communist energy is expended in denunciation of rival Communists rather than in denunciation of capitalism, and those being wooed tend often to conclude “a plague on both your houses.” On the other hand, in some parts of Asia and Africa, the Chinese Communists have been able to gain strength by an unabashed appeal to racism, an appeal that lumps together white Russian Communists with white American capitalists as the enemy. New Problems For policymakers of the major non‐Communist nations, the split has, of course, produced major new problems. In Japan and the major Western European nations the reaction has been to conclude that the old image of a united Communist world seeking to “bury” the non‐Communist world is now a fantasy. This in turn has encouraged efforts to negotiate with both Russia and China separately and to make deals reflecting efforts to serve the national interests of different countries. In the United States, the impact has been less profound and the concept of an ideological conflict between Communism and the non‐Communist world still has many supporters in and out of public office. But Senator J. W. Fulbright's recent appeal for a re‐evaluation of American foreign policy in the light of what the Senator considers to be the new “realities” has drawn considerable sympathetic comment, though not full agreement, from President Johnson and lesser officials. There is still no evidence, however, that the Johnson Administration is as prepared to base American foreign policy upon concepts born of the split as, say, the Government of President de Gaulle of France or even Britain's Conservative party.

481-> IRVING BABCOCK, EX‐GM AIDE, DIES
PONTIAC, Mich., Feb. 7 (AP) — Irving B. Babcock, a former vice president of the General Motors Corporation, died of a heart attack yesterday at his home in Bloomfield Hills. He was 72 years old. At his death Mr. Babcock was a director of the Wake­field Corporation of Detroit. He left General Motors in 1944 to become president of the Avco Corporation. Surviving are three daughters, Mrs. J. Reed Alexander of Bloomfield Hills, Mrs. Madeline B. Vinton of Guelph, Ont., and Mrs. James H. Weeks of Bir­mingham; eight grandchildren and three great‐grandchildren. Mr. Babcock became presi­dent and general manager of the Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company, a Gen­eral Motors division, in 1935 at the age of 44. He was elected a vice president of General Mo­tors in 1943, when its GMC Truck and Coach division took over Yellow Truck and Coach. After having servea as presi­dent of the Aviation Corpora­tion, now the Avco Corpora­tion, he was named board chair­man of the Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation, in which Avco held a large interest. In 1946 Consolidated Vultee purchased the ACF‐Brill Motors Company, and Mr. Babcock be­came board chairman. Mean­while Avco also bought the radio and household appliance business of the Crosley Corpo­ration. which he headed. He resigned as president of Avco in April, 1948, but con­tinued as a director and con­sultant. He also was a director of the Crosley Broadcasting Company. Mr. Babcock, a native of Mil­waukee, began his career as an office boy in the Chicago of­fices of the Liquid Carbonic Company. He attended DePaul University, taking a full course at night while working, and in 1916 received a Bachelor of Laws degree. Under a graduate scholarship, he studied account­ing and business management. Upon graduation from De­Paul, he left Liquid Carbonic to join an automotive engine manufacturing company, and in 1920 he joined the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company. Five years later Yellow Cab was taken over by General Motors and became the Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Com­pany.

482-> STATE PLANS STUDY OF HOSPITAL COSTS
ALBANY, March 2 — Governor Rockefeller announced at a news conference today that he soon would appoint a commission to study hospital costs. He said the commission would consist of 10 to 15 members. The decision was prompted by the request of the Associated Hospital Service of New York last week for an increase in Blue Cross rates of between 22 and 25 per cent. The association has 7.4 million subscribers in 17 southern New York counties, including the five in New York City. Mr. Rockefeller said the comnmission would seek ways in which hospital care could be reduced and the rise in hospital insurance rates held down. He indicated his support for a bill that would provide some state control over the construction of new hospitals where additional facilities were not needed. The Governor said the appointment of the commission would not delay consideration of the proposed rate increases by the State Insurance Department, which will hold public hearings before acting. “What we want to do is hold down costs,” Mr. Rockefeller said. “We don’t want to bankrupt the system.”

484-> League Chief Penalizes Sullivan, Ranger Coach, for Encouraging Violence; CAMPELL CITES MONTREAL FIGHT; Sullivan Fined $200 for Role in Hadfield‐Richard Run‐In and Post‐Game Comments
MONTREAL Jan 2 (AP)—Clarence Campbell, the president of the National Hockey League, fined Coach Red Sullivan of the New York Rangers $200 today for encouraging violence during a game here Dec. 12 between the Rangers and Montreal Canadiens. Campbell also said there had been a “declaration of immunity” by Sullivan to one of his players to the effect that the player personally would not have to pay an automatic fine. Campbell cited the incident that involved Henri Richard of Montreal and Vic Hadfield of New York, who engaged in “a brief stick‐swinging duel for which they were penalized.” The fight was renewed in the penalty box “in the form of fisticuffs,” Cambpell said. Both players, he said, were given misconduct penalties “which exhausted the balance of the playting time, and both retired from the game.” “In a subsequent dressingroom interview, Rangers Coach Red Sullivan is reported to have stated that he told Hadfield that if he got another shot at the guy in the penalty box to take it and not to worry about the automatic misconduct fine,” Campbell said. Campbell went on: “My investigation shows that there is no doubt that statements of the kind were made by Sullivan in the interview as reported, but Sullivan contends that his instructions to Hadfield were not intended as an incitement to cause further trouble in the penalty box but simply a warning to Hadfield to be on the alert to protect himself while in the penalty box. “Sullivan also contends that the reference to the ‘automatic fine being taken care of’ was never communicated to Hadfield at any time, but was simply an expression of hiF personal sentiments of satisfaction at the time of Hadfield's actions in defending himself in the penalty‐box fight “Regardless of the exact words used by Sullivan or the impression he wished to convey, I am satisfied that he was quoted substantially correctly. “Both aspects of the quotations — the encouragement of further violence and the declaration of immunity of the effect of the normal displinary effect of the automatic fine—clearly contravene the league's bylaws. “Furthermore, any action on the part of any official of the club to offset the effect of such a fine would make the responsible parties and the club itself liable to very heavy penalties. “In these circumstances. I consider that a fine of $200 should be imposed on Coach Red Sullivan, and it is ordered accordingly.” Campbell's action marked the fifth time this season that a coach or manager had been fined. As the result of a brawl in Toronto Dec. 7 between the Chicago Black Hawks and the Toronto Maple Leafs, Coach Billy Reay of the Hawks and General Manager‐Coach Punch Imlach of Toronto were fined $1,000 each for failing to control their players. Last October, Reay and General Manager Tommy Ivan of Chicago drew fines—Ivan $200 and Reay $100—after a game misconduct penalty to a Hawk defenseman, Howie Young. Ivan was fined for going into the officials' dressing room and Reay for stalling tactics.

485-> HERB BOUNTY BEGINS WITH A HEAD START INDOORS
PLANTS of many different herbs can be bought in nurseries and even in supermarkets. Many gardeners, however, regard it as more economical and certainly more fun to grow their own plants from seed. A few herbs can be seeded directly in the garden as soon as the soil can be worked, usually in early March. Other kinds go in during April, as spring advances. A few, such as basil, must wait until mid‐May when the ground is warm. Gardeners can out‐maneuver some of these late‐starters by planting them indoors in flats. Seed‐starting containers can be improvised from any shallow boxes (two to four inches deep) with cracks or holes in the bottom for drainage. Standard flats of the usual 16 by 22 inches are reasonable in price. Clay pots can be used, too. Well‐Drained Soil The bottom holes or cracks should be covered with pieces of broken flower pots and a layer of sphagnum moss; this combination will allow free drainage and yet keep the soil from sifting out of the flat. The soil mixture should contain equal parts of loam, leafmold and sharp sand. Firm it down with a brick or piece of flat wood. Add a thin layer of fine soil. Moisten the entire flat well before sowing. Among the herbs that can be seeded early in flats indoors are basil, parsley, sweet marjoram, summer savory, thyme, sage, rosemary and perhaps lemon balm or verbena for fragrance. There are three main types of basil. The traditional culinary form is sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum), which has lettucelike leaves and grows between two and three feet in height. A similar but smaller and lower form is bush basil (O. minimum). A good rock garden or border plant that also has culinary value is the recently introduced Dark Opal; it is low growing and mahogany colored. Basil seed germinates in about a week. Seedlings need sun and warmth. They grow rapidly and by mid‐May can be set out in the garden. The smaller types should stand six to eight inches apart, the larger about a foot apart. Both curly and flat‐leaved parsley (Petroselinum hortense var. crispum and var. filicinum) are slow to germinate, usually requiring several weeks. Sow seed in shallow rows in a flat. Cover the seed lightly with soil; keep moist. When transplanting to the garden, set the plants six inches apart to allow for large bushy growth. Remember, when harvesting, to take the outer, fully developed leaves. The plants will continue to grow outward and thus will run to seed less quickly. Seed of both sweet marjoram and that similar little herb, summer savory (Majorana hortensis and Satureja hortensis) are fine grained. They will be easier to sow evenly if mixed first with a little sand. Both kinds germinate in two to three weeks. They must be kept moist. Some seed may succumb to the damping‐off disease before new leaves can push through even a light covering of soil. Keep the flat out of strong sunlight until the marjoram and savory plants are established. Then give them more light for a week. Finally, transplant to the garden, to a site in full sunlight; space the plants about 12 inches apart. Light chalky soil is best for marjoram. Savory grows easily in almost any garden soil. Thyme (Thymus vulgaris) also does well in flats. Seedlings are transplanted to the garden, about four to six inches apart. Culinary sage (Salvia officinalis) is a perennial herb; it grows about two feet high and usually blooms in the second year. The plants tend to become woody after three or four years, and are then best discarded. I like to keep a few young plants of sage coming along to replace the old. Sow the seed thinly in flats of soil. Sow enough to allow for some discards, as sage does not always come up true to type. Set the plants outdoors when they are about three inches high, or have developed half a dozen leaves. Allow about 18 to 24 inches between plants. Verbena and lemon balm ger‐ minate fairly quickly, usually within a week. Since verbena requires a rather long growing season before flowering, seed is best started early in flats indoors. Sow both verbena and lemon balm thinly. Do not cover with soil; simply press down gently with a piece of wood. Cover the flat with a pane of glass. Keep the plants warm and in a sunny place. The glass cover will reduce the need for watering. When all danger of frost is past, the seedlings can be set out in the garden. Verbena should then bloom from early summer until frost. Older types of verbena are low‐growing and need only a few inches of space between plants, much less spacing than needed by the newer varieties which are usually larger and more showy (and often less fragrant). Lemon balm seedlings should stand 10 to 12 inches apart. Rosemary, a fragrant, decorative and culinary herb, must be considered a pot plant north of Washington, D.C. It requires extra care. Seed germination takes about three weeks and growth is slow. Seedlings should be kept warm, slightly moist and in a sunny place. When the seedlings are a few inches tall, transfer them to well‐drained pots filled with slightly alkaline soil. Potted plants or individually planted seedlings of rosemary can be placed in the garden for the summer, but they must be brought indoors well in advance of the first frost. A few hardy herbs can be planted directly in the garden as soon as the soil can be worked. Among these are two attractive substitutes for parsley, namely, chervil (Anthriscus cerefolium) and peppergrass or garden cress (Lepidium sativum). Both are quick growers and do best in cool weather. Chervil seed is black and very fine; it may be simply scat‐ tered on top of the ground, then lightly pressed down. Chervil does best in rich humus and partial shade. The seedlings must be thinned to stand about three inches apart. The plants can be clipped several times (for kitchen use) before hot weather arrives and they run to seed. To assure a continued harvest, a second planting can be made in late August. Peppergrass likewise does well in rich soil; it can stand a bit more sun. Seed of many other herbs can be planted directly outside when spring begins to warm the ground in April. In some cases, such as dill and sweet fennel, seed should be sowed where the plants are to grow, for they do not respond well to transplanting. Seedlings Are Thinned Dill germinates in about a week. The seedlings should be thinned to six inches apart. The plants grow from two to three feet tall. They need a sunny location with some protection from wind. Sweet fennel (Foeniculum vulgare var. dulce) is similar to dill in appearance, height and use. Fennel seed is planted half an inch deep, about one inch apart. Seedlings are thinned, as with dill. Three more old favorites that belong in any herb garden are salad burnet, borage and rue. All do well in poor, chalky, well‐drained soil and full sun. Sow the seed of all three in shallow drills. Later on, thin the seedlings. Borage and rue need about a foot between plants. Burnet is often planted as a border, where the plants can stand closer together.

PARIS, April 1—Communist China was accused today by a Soviet official of racial and chauvinist policies “no different from Nazism.” Bobodzhan G. Gafurov, deputy chairman of the Soviet Committee for African‐Asian Soli‐ darity, assailed the Chinese in an interview. He came here from Algiers where he headed the Soviet delegation to the African‐Asian Solidarity Conference last week. Mr. Gafurov, in remarks to the French Press Agency, said: “The maddened anti‐Communists of the United States want a war of the right and the maddened Chinese want a war of the left. There is no difference.” He charged that the Chinese wanted to unite the black and yellow races “against the whites.” “It is hate that they foment,” Mr. Gafurov said. He also accused the Chinese of carrying out a policy of “forced assimilation” in Inner Mongolia. Chinese, he said, are forced to marry Mongol women and Mongols to wed Chinese. “In Sinkiang,” Mr. Gafurov continued, “non‐Chinese people are persecuted and take refuge in the Soviet Union, where they arrive naked, starved and destitute.”

491-> Realities In Illusion; THE STREET OF CROCODILES: B Bruao Schulz Trarotated from the Polish, with an introduction, by Ce­lina Wieniswska. 159 pp. New York: Walker& Co $2.95.
BRUNO SCHULZ, the author of this remarkable collection of storles, lived a sol itary life in the provincial Po lish town of Drohobycz, where he sustained himself outwardl by teaching art in a boys' school, and inwardly by consecrating endless hours to writing—until, in 1942, he was shot dead by a Gestapo agent for venturing outside the ghetto to which he and the rest of the town's Jews had been confined Though small—two story collections, one novella—Schulz's literary output has been recognized in Europe to be of extraordinary quality. Fortunately, his first volume of stories, originally published in Poland in 1934 as “Cinnamon Shops,” can now be read in English, in this superb (retitled) translation by Celina Wieniewska. “The Street of Crocodiles” is basically a gallery of 13 recollections of the author's boyhood and the wild eccentricities of his family—especially of his wonderfully weird cloth‐merchant father, who sometimes resembles a Biblical prophet, hatches exotic birds in the attic until the whole house is full of them, and insists that tailor's dummies are as worthy of respect as people. Yet the stories are far more than family portraits; at turns realistic, brutal, ironic, bizarre and comically fanciful, they illustrate and comment on not only life, but contemporary lit‐ erary forms and, at center, the nature of reality and illusion, the extent to which the creator is a forger of truth. This is explored with special intensity in the title story, an attempt to recall the location of a tawdry remainder shop the writer visited as a boy, in the rear of which pornographic engravings and etchings were sold and surrealistically acted out. He remembers emerging into the street: “It is, as usual in that district, a gray day, and the whole scene seems at times like a photograph in an illustrated magazine, so gray, so one‐dimensional are the houses, the people and the vehicles. Reality is as thin as paper and betrays with all its cracks its imitative character.” Although Schulz is most often compared with Kafka (whose “Trial” he translated into Polish), there is nothing imitative in these stories. They are original, rich in language and perception, and it is good to have them at last available here.

494-> OSTERMAN GIVEN A YEAR IN PRISON; Ousted Judge Sentenced as Liquor‐License Fixer
Melvin H. Osterman, ousted Judge of the State Court of Appels, was sentenced yesterday to one year in the city penitentiary as a fixer in liquor‐license cases. State Supreme Court Justice Joseph A. Sarafite imposed a term of one year on each of three conspiracy counts, but he directed that they be served concurrently. The sentence was pronounced in the same courthouse where Osterman once had served as a justice of the Supreme Court. With time off for good behavior, Osterman could be freed in eight months. The 61-year‐old prisoner spent last night in the Men's House of Detention, in a wing of the Criminal Court Building, He is to be taken this morning to Rikers Island. There Osterman will be outfitted in gray jail garb and assigned a number. Osterman pleaded guilty to the three counts on April 6, at the start of the fourth day of his trial on an indictment that had charged five instances of conspiracy to bribe State Liquor Authority officials and one count of bribery. If convicted on all counts he could have been sentenced to one year in jail and fined $500.on each conspiracy count, misdemeanors, and 10 years for bribery, a felony. The confessed fixer, looking dignified in a charcoal gray suit and white shirt, stood mute during his ten minutes in court yesterday. His set face gave no evidence of his emotions as he heard Justice Sarafite say that he had undermined public confidence in the courts and in government. Justice Sarafite told Osterman that his plea of guilty, which obviated a long trial, Was “a creditable act but it does not condone the offense.” Declaring that bribery struck at the very foundations of government, Justice Sarafite said: “The injury is devastating when the one who offers a bribe and the one who is bribed both hold lofty positions of public trust.” Osterman had admitted in open court, at the time he pleaded guilty, that he had offered a $5,000 bribe in 1962 to Martin C. Epstein, who was then chairman of the State Liquor Authority. He said that Commissioner Epstein had agreed to accept it to fix a liquor - law - violation case involving a package store owned by Huntington Hartford, the grocery chain heir and philanthropist. Chief Assistant District Attorney Alfred J. Scotti, who directed a two‐year investigation into a widespread liquor‐license scandal, said yesterday he in[tended to put Mr. Epstein on trial within a few days. The former commissioner is under indictment for accepting bribes and cheating on his state income tax by not reporting them as income. Mr. Scotti declined to say whether he would call Osterman as a witness against Mr. Epstein. Governor Rockefeller, who had appointed Mr. Epstein to the S. L. A., dismissed him from the $25,000 post in November, 1962, after Mr. Epstein had refused to waive immunity from prosecution and testify before a grand jury. Osterman, another Rockefeller appointee, was told by the Governor to resign his $26,000 position in April, 1963, for refusing to waive immunity under similar circumstances. When Judge Osterman refused to quit, the Governor called a special Court on the Judiciary, which ousted the judge after a hearing. Mr. Scotti said yesterday he intended to put Mr. Epstein on trial whether or not Mrs. Roselyn Epstein, the former Commissioner's wife, is required to return to the grand jury room. Supreme Court Justice Mitchell D. Schweitzer had held Mrs. Epstein in contempt and sentenced her to 30 days in jail for refusing make responsive answers before the grand jury. Judge Schweitzer stayed the jail term to give Mrs. Epstein a chance to purge herself of contempt. She went before the jury again, but her answers were described by Mr. Scotti as so “fantastic” and “incredible” that he asked Justice Schweitzer to commit her to jail at once. Justice Schweitzer reserved decision pending his own study of the questions and answers. That was more than a month ago. Meanwhile, Mrs. Epstein has been in Florida with her husband, who has had a leg amputated because of diabetes. Mr. Scotti said yesterday he would prefer it if Mrs. Epstein were compelled to make responsive answers before the grand jury “But I’m not going to keep Epstein forever,” Mr. Scotti said. “He's next on my list.” Justice Sarafite's courtroom was almost empty when the court clerk called Osterman for sentencing at 10:05 A.M. Osterman who had been sitting on a spectators’ bench with his son, Melvin, Jr., a member of the Governor's legal staff, arose and stood at the defense table beside his lawyer, former Chief Assistant District Attorney Sol Gelb. Mr. Gelb handed to the court a copy of a letter Osterman had sent to the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court resigning from the bar and requesting that his name be stricken from the roll of lawyers. Asking Justice Sarafite to be as compassionate as possible, Mr. Gelb said that his client's removal as a judge and now his severance from the bar after more than 35 years as a lawyer were “a terrible disgrace and severe punishment” in themselves. Mr. Gelb said his client's plea of guilty had saved the state the cost of a lenghty trial. He added that Osterman had “not compounded the mischief by taking the stand and committing perjury.” Justice Sarafite delivered his remarks on the seriousness of the former judge's offense in a grave, but not scolding, tone. Osterman, a former Republican leader in the Fifth Assembly District on the West Side, had law officed at 25 West 43d Street where he handled, among other cases, those of several bars and nightclubs having trouble with the S.L.A. After he became a judge he ostensibly gave up private practice, but, according to the state, continued to take such cases

496-> New Cuban Education Center Trains Young for Farm Roles
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, March 18—Fifteen hundred selected children from Oriente Province's muntainous regions are being trained at the Camilo Cienfuegos School at Las Mercedes. By JUAN de ONIS An assistant director, Virgilio Gomez Fuentes, said: “We don't call it MarxismLeninism. The course is called Economic Studies, but we begiri giving them the rudiments hefe in the fourth grade.” The attractive new school, being constructed to hold up to 20,000 students, covers the fourth to 10th grade. The emphasis is on training. farm technicians, although gifted pupils can move on to the university level. For those who do, there is the University of Oriente here, with a School of Economics that gives special attention to agricultural economics. Dr. Rolando Silva, the 35-year-old director of the School of Economics, which now has 600 enrolled students, said: “Almost all students are turned toward the practical realities of the Cuban economy as well as the theoretical studies pf mathematics, accounting, statistics and planning. Many of our students are already working in industries and farms, but we regard the formation of a revolutionary conscience and a scientific knowledge of Communism as indispensable.” Dr. Silva became a Marxist revolutionary as a student leader in 1956.He received his economics degree from the Unlversity of Havana in 1962. The basic academic course or the School of Economics includes two years of political economy, divided into two sections. One is called “Capitalist Imperialism.” It includes nonMarxist economics, from Adam Smith to Walt W. Rostow (currently head of the State Department's Policy Planning Council), and refers to the Cuban situation before Fidel Castro's revolution triumphed in 1959. Transitions to Socialism The other section is called “Transitions to Socialism,” the supposed situation of Cuba now. There are also courses in Marxist-Leninist theory and tactics in addition to a heavy load of instruction in planning, foreign trade, finance, and other marily from Communist-bloc texts. Thus, from the primary school to the university, the expanded Cuban educational system couples technical training, closely tied to the requirements of the National Economic Development Plan, with the ideological formation of “vanguards,” or leader elements at various levels of society. This effort in state education began after the nationalization of private schools and the nationwide literacy campaign in 1961. It is designed to be in full swing by decade, when the system is supposed to begin producing gradgraduates in large numbers, al though the first are already emerging. The published Cuban budget assigns about 270 million pesos (the peso is officially at par with the dollar) to education, including adult literacy and worker-peasant improvement courses, teacher training and research. The Camilo Cienfuegos School,a pet project of Premier Castro, is directed by Capt. Sidroc Ramos Palacios, a tall, blond-bearded man of few words. He was engaged in political education in Dr. Castro's rebel army in 1959. His wife, Berarda Salavarria, an assistant director of the school, is a university-trained educator. The school authorities are proud that many of the pupils come from remote mountain villages where the regime has been sending grade‐school teachers. The children here were choaen as superior students, yet the majority have to take improvement courses to meet the standards of the fourth grade, which this school begins. Many of the beginners are as old as 16, but they arrived with first‐grade accomplishments. “When they come here, some have to be taught to sleep in a bed with sheets,” said Mr. Gomez, a 41-year-old former in rural schools. Within a few days new arrivals are marching in formation to classes. Working in electrical or carpentry shops, or picking lettuce in the school's vegetable garden, is part of their instruction. The economic studies soon follow. In one classroom were about 30 little girls who had been at the school for a week. The teather, Luz Maria Cervantes, who appeared to be a teenager, was reviewing a lesson. “Who can tell me what a hydroeleetrio station is?” she asked. A girl in the front row put up her hand and said: “It's a big house from which light comes.” The teacher pursed her lips disapprovingly, then read loudly from a manual. "A hydroelectric station . is a production unit that generates electricity beside a river,” she said. The little girl looked blank. A group of older boya in another classroom were studying “expression” with a young woman in a green militia, uniform. On the blackboard was a map of central Cuba. Arrows showed the invasion of Las Villas Province in 1958 by the guerrilla columns of CoCmmandant Camilo Cienfuegos and Maj. Ernesto Che Guevara, now Minister of Industry, during the Castro insurrection that toppled President Fulgencio Batista. The pupils live in any twostory concrete buildings . of modern design. Each dormitory has a dining room, study hall and social center. The pupils are grouped in units of 50, with a senior adviser who supervises their collective life. This includes organized work and study periods, sports, servicing food, cleaning the dormitories and caring for the lawns. “There is a weekly meeting of criticism and self-criticism during which the students examine the week's work, make plans and impose disciplinary measures in the case of infractions,” Mr. Gomez said. Examples of infractions are an unmade bunk or cutting classes. “The worst punishment for these boys is to be deprived of participation in group work, such as cultivating the gardens,” Mr. Gomez said. Punishment can also bring suspension of recreation or visiting rights. The school year is 11 months long, with one month off around Christmas for the pupils to go home to visit their families. At the University of ©riente, the inadequate preparation of students from the secondary schools is as much a problem as the shortcomings in primary instruction of the arrivals at the Camilo Cienfuegos School. Dr. Silva said that of the 600 students enrolled at the School of Economics this year, 300 were in a pre-university course to bridge the gap between their secondary-school preparation and the requirements of the first years of the School of Economics. The same situation exists in the School of Technology, which graduates mine, mechanical, chemical, industrial and metallurgical engineers in five years. The University of Oriente has new classrooms and laboratory buildings and campus residences for more than 600 scholarship students. Its enrollment of 2,200 is small compared with Havana University's 18,000, but it is very active in areas that are closely related to the economic plans for Oriente Province.

499-> President Reported In Command
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanganyika, Tuesday, Jan. 21 (UPI)—President Nyerere was reported to be in firm control in Tanganyika today after the mutiny by African army units against their white British officers. The whereabouts of the President was still unknown, but his press attaché, George Rockey, said this morning that Dr. Nyerere was “safe, well and in command” of the situation. Earlier reports said that he had fled the capital and had flown to Kenya in a small plane. One rumor said he was shot by the dissident troops who took over the capital. An uneasy calm prevailed in Dar es Salaam this morning. Yesterday mobs shouting “Colonialists go home” stormed through the streets, smashing shops, throwing bottles and dancing on the roofs of cars. The mutiny by the First Bat‐ talion of the Tanganyikan army began as a nonpolitical protest to demand more pay and the ousting of the white officers. It had appeared to have ended and the troops had returned to their barracks when the situation suddenly worsened. The troops had returned to their barracks after having seized control of the capital and surrounded the presidential palace. They then joined in the rioting. Some Europeans were seized and maltreated. Cabinet ministers were reported under arrest, but Foreign Minister Oscar Kambona was heard in a broadcast urging the troons to return to the barracks. With Zanzibar falling into leftist hands last weekend, British officials were worried that the outbreak of rebellions would engulf all of East Africa. British ministers involved in African affairs held urgent consultations in London. The mutiny broke out at 2 A.M. It appeared that the troops had staged a coup d'etat while about 150 members of the Tanganyika. police force were across the Zanzibar Channel in Zanzibar helping maintain order after the coup there last weekend. The Tanganyika police had gone to Zanzibar at the request of the revolutionary regime. Later the rebellious troops cordoned off large areas of the city. They seized 30 Britons, officers and their wives and children, but released them soon afterward The rebels seized control of the airport and dock area and set up Bren guns on barricades in strategic areas of the city. African troops patrolled streets in Land Rovers and trucks mounted with Bren guns. Rebel leaders said about 700 men were involved in the mutiny. They said they went to the home of Mr. Kambona, who is also the Defense Minister, dragged him out of bed, took him to the barracks, and pointing at the Britons, told him: “Get rid of these men. We do not want them.” The British commander of the Tanganyika army, Brig. V. S. Douglas, was arrested by the rebels, but escaped. The rebels complained that promotions were slow and said they resented the way the white officers were treating them. They said they were dissatisfied with their low pay. But the revolt apparently did not spread beyond the First Battalion. The mutiny coincided with a visit here by John Okello, who had appointed himself field marshal of the army that helped overthrow the Zanzibar Government. There was no indication that his visit was directly connected with the mutiny here. Tanganyika, a former German territory and later a trusteeship of the League of Nations and the United Nations, became a member of the British Commonwealth in 1961 and a republic on Dec. 9, 1962. Its capital was founded in 1862 by the Sultan of Zanzibar. It has a population of 9.5 million, including 20,000 Europeans and 100,000 Asians, mostly Indians and Pakistanis. Efforts to link it in a federation with neighboring Kenya and Uganda, which would form a state the size of Europe, have failed. Tanganyika, larger than France and Germany combined, is the home of the famous Mount Kilimanjaro. Although it is a country of much primitive splendor, half of it is too arid or plagued with tsetse flies to permit wide settlement. The country borders on Lake Victoria, the world's second largest body of fresh water, and Lake Tanganyika, exceeded in depth only by Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union. Tanganyika is the world's leading producer of sisal and her resources include diamonds for industrial use, gold, silver and tin. The name of the humid capital, Dar es Salaam, means Haven of Peace in Arabic.

505-> Art: Use of Color in ‘New’ Abstraction; Three Younger Artists Have Displays
WHETHER a show is good or bad is one point. Whether it is interesting or not is another. They don't always correlate exactly. Three exhibitions in town are all interesting—indeed exciting —in their ways, while leaving their ultimate quality in some doubt, though we may gladly give the benefit of that doubt to the artists. The exhibitions are George Mueller's at the Grippi & Waddell Gallery, 905 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street; Ernest Dieringer's at Poindexter, 21 West 56th, and David Lee's at the Bridge Gallery, 61 West 56th Street. All use the slicing, aggressive color of the “new” abstraction. George Mueller is unusual in that he applies this color not to pure abstraction but to a subject from real life—nothing more nor less than a porch, with verandas, windows, railings, trees—a motif he uses over and over again immaculately, like someone distilling and redistilling an essence. Then having defined the scene (in black and white) he starts playing on it with color like a musician, a comparison he invites with titles like “Four Random Variations in 15 Tones” and “Anton Webern, Op. 5, No. 3.” The latter presumably refers to the third movement of Webern's five pieces for string quartet, and Mr. Mueller's pictorial coding of it looks like hip Mondrian. He then superimposes this schema over theme, the old front porch, so that it looks like what “Home on the Range” in 12‐tone would sound like (which is very exciting). In his purification of the porch, an old Saturday Evening Post cover cliché, and is turning of this common‐ place motif to uncommon purposes, Mr. Mueller is unique. His show is one of the most exciting in town. Ernest Dieringer at Poindexter has an excess of courage. He'll try anything. His main act of daring is an attempt (mostly unsuccessful) to transfuse the hard optical geometry of the “new” abstraction with some romantic feeling-an attempt signaled by soft veils of paint drawn over the staccato colors. He pulls his transparencies like color filters over all sorus of serialized motifs (lattices, geometric spirals, etc.), producing such things as floating, ghostly diamonds in hard vertical and horizontal grilles. He is best when he doesn't confuse himself with too many ambitions, e. g., “Dutch Argyle” and “Greek Key II.” The show is one of more excitement than achievement, of Searching rather than finding. David Lee does all the finding by limiting himself to motifs (serialized small squares, pairs of blocky U shapes on their sides facing each other) repeated with machinelike precision and brought to optical life with the most sparing, almost grudging, color. His canvases usually have a breaking point at the midhorizontal where there is a change‐over in patterns. Absolutely symmetrical, his work is based on an unseen network of calculations, and this perfect precision lifted into pale poetry through restrained color makes his pictures look like I.B.M. punch cards that had been given a soul. Limited his art is, but the maximum profit is drawn from between these limits. This is in itself a definition of artistic intelligence. All three shows, by three younger artists, are worth seeing.

509-> HARVARD CHEERS FOR ‘CUSSEDNESS’; It Ranks That Quality With High Grades in Students
CAMBRIDG7E, Mass., Jan. 11 — A touch of “cussedness” combined with mtegrity, generosity and judgment is as likely to produce a successful Harvard student as placidity and high grades, a study at Harvard College has disclossed. A report in the current Harvard Alumni Bulletin by Fred L. Glimp, dean of admissions and Financial Aids, and Dean K. Whitla, associate director of admissions, disclosed that young men with a “touch of greatness,” not numbered among the “high scorers” on entrance examinations, are likely to emerge as successful students. “Personal strengths,” the report said, “seem to be relevant to the intellectual life of the college, probably because they include effectiveness and responsiveness.” The report noted Harvard's practices in selecting from among more than 5,000 applicants for admission each year a freshman class of about 1,200 men. In rating men, the report said, personal qualities are considered along with the scores of the Scholastic Aptitude Tests and other information. After measuring the records of the two types of students, the study found, in part, the answer to the question: “What are the personnel qualities which seem to insure success in college as well as the Scholastic Aptitude Tests do?” “Our consensus is limited to an agreement,” the report stated. “that personal qualities should not be narrowly defined. One can argue that we should have a number of distinct ratings for qualities of effectiveness, energy, judgment and for odd‐fashioned qualities of integ rity or generosity of spirit or cussedness.” The report said all these qualities went into the personal rating of the young man and that it had been found that “a candidate who receives a very high personal rating is not expected to combine qualities of s a intliness and extraordinary effectiveness and fierce independence.” The report said the young man entering Harvard was not regarded as “impressive” just because he was inoffensive, generally polite or “wellrounded”. The report uncovered what its authors called “good news” in that “our personal rating is independent of academic ability and that high or low persoanl ratings are about evenly disributed at high levels of ability and at lower levels.” The study also found that students emerging among the bottom 10 per cent on Scholastic Aptitude Tests graduated as frequently on schedule as did their higher‐rated classmates, although half as frequently with honors.

511-> CIVIL RIGHTS: BILL IS HEADING TO TOUGHER SENATE BATTLEGROUND; Fight Nearing an End in the House Was Hardly a Token Battle, but War That Is Now Coming Up in the Senate Is Another Matter
WASHINTON, Feb. 8—The House battle on the civil rights bill is all but over. The war in the Senate is about to begin. In the House the Southerners were defeated at every turn. But the bill in the Senate will be something else again. The difference between the House and the Senate is the difference between the five‐minute rule on amendments and unlimited debate. The battle in the House was hardly a battle, not even a token one. The Southern leaders threw up amendments by the dozen. But time and again not more than half or two‐thirds of their regional force—numbering about 100—passed between the tellers. They were whipped before they started, they knew it, and their heart was not in it. The Southern leaders had no hopes of tempering those provisions of the bill most repugnant to the South. They were not out even to make a showing. They were intent on making a record—first, for the folks back home, but more importantly for the use of their friends in the Senate, which will be the Verdun in this struggle. The Senate has held no hearings on the bill as it is. Last summer's hearings in the Senate Commerce Committee were limited to the public accommodations section. The hearings on the whole of the original bill in the Judiciary Committee were nothing but a marathon legal hazing of the Attorney General by “the North Carolina solon,” as Senator Sam Ervin calls himself. Therefore the Southern leaders in the House used their time to open up salients for the big push in the Senate. Nevertheless the ease with which the coalition of Northern Democrats and Republicans were carrying the day in the House should not be allowed to detract from the significance of what happened there this week. This is the most far‐reaching civil rights bill ever put before Congress. Its prohibitions—against subjective use of voter qualification tests, against discrimination in public accommodations and state‐operated public facilities, against police brutality and denial of first amendment rights, against discrimination in Federally‐assisted programs —and the powers given to the Attorney General to initiate, or intervene in, legal proceedings to enforce these prohibitions, all added up to an extension of Federal authority unthinkable a few years ago. smoothly through the House? Why has it received such overwhelming support? The two questions, of course, are interrelated. It moved easily because of organization. There are 432 members in the House now, with three vacancies. Not once did fewer than 400 answer a quorum call. The civil rights supporters had compelling reasons to be on hand—White House pressure, of course, but even more important this election year was the presence in the galleries of mental tellers from civil rights groups, labor organizations, religious affiliates. And then the unofficial organization of Northern Democratic liberals, known as the Democratic Study Group, had a very effective whip system working to keep all their members appraised of the parliamentary situation and forestall any “snap” Southern amendments. Most important, there was the bipartisan coalition. There have been many coalitions of Southern Democrats and Northern Republicans. Never has there been such a coalition of Northern Republicans and Democrats of liberals and conservatives in both parties. Representative Emanuel Celler and William M. McCulloch, the Brooklyn Democrat and the rural Ohio Republican, who are the chairman and ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee, worked perfectly in harness as floor managers. They got effective help from two young members, John V. Lindsay, Manhattan Republican, and James C. Corman, California Democrat, who made during the debate their first real mark in the House. On this great issue the Republican past joined forces with the Democratic present. But all this organization would have gone for nothing—indeed the coalition could not have been assembled—unless there had been a rational and emotional consensus behind the bill. The consensus was there in the realization that the time had come to repair an old and grievous wrong, and to square the national conduct with the professions set forth at the nation's beginning and inscribed in the Constitution. It was this consensus so deeply held and felt that gave the tone to the proceedings. The tone was set at the outset by two conservative Ohio Republicans. Mr. McCulloch said to the House: “I believe in the effective separation of powers and in a workable Federal system, whereby state authority is not needlessly usurped by a centralized government, but I also believe that an obligation rests with the National Government to see that the citizens of every state are treated equally. “Where, then, individuals, or governmental authorities, fail to shoulder their obligations, and only stress their rignts, it is the duty of the Congress, under Constitutional authority, to correct that wrong. To do less would be to shirk our responsibility as national legislators, and as human beings, who honor the principles of liberty and justice. “No one would suggest that the Negro receives equality of treatment and equality of opportunity in many fields of activity today.” Clarence J. Brown, ranking Republican on the Rules Committee, who moved to clear the 1957 and 1960 Civil Rights Bills from that committee, entreated his colleagues: “I hope we can conduct ourselves so that we can say to our children and our grandchildren that we participated in one of the great debates in American history, and we did it as statesmen.” The Northern speakers, for the most part, were careful not to rub salt in Southern wounds. On the Southern side, one or two caricatures of Claghorn made stump speeches. But the Southern leaders, and particularly Edwin E. Willis of Louisiana, the Southern floor manager, were well aware that the problem was real and exigent, and they avoided the clichés about “understanding the Negro” and “you can't legislate morality.” When the House got down to work, it was a lawyer's debate. The Southern leaders were not arguing that nothing had to be done. They were arguing how far the Federal Government had a right to go. What this amounted to, actually, was a plea for more local time. But time had run out on the South. And in the House, the parliamentary clock is running against the Southerners. They must vote by Tuesday. It will be different in the Senate. Again it will be a lawyer's debate. But the Southerners will have the parliamentary rules on their side, and in their leader, Senator Richard B. Russell, Democrat of Georgia, a man who has mastered the use of them for his purposes. Being a man who is not a racist, but is embittered by the racial issue, by the demonstrations, by the changing mores and the Federal Government's intervention, Mr. Russells' purposes will be to fight the bill with all his might, not in the hope of killing it, but of emasculating it. The Administration strategy calls for meeting the House bill at the Senate door, a parliamentary device that allows the bill to go immediately on the cal endar without reference to the burial ground of the Judiciary Committee presided over by Senator James O. Eastland, Democrat of Mississippi. But motion to call the bill from the calendar is debatable. At that point the filibuster is expected to begin. Right now Administration leaders cannot count the 67 votes needed to break the filibuster. Majority Leader Mike Mansfield of Montana has said he will not have on his conscience the possible consequences of around‐the‐clock sessions. There are too many old men in the Senate. As a matter of fact, history gives no support for the belief that such sessions can break the Southerners. Under Senator Russell's platoon system, which requires each one of his eighteen stalwarts to speak only once in three days and which allows each speaker and his Mr. Bones to keep the opposition sleepless with quorum calls, it is more likely that the civil rights supporters will collapse before the Southerners. There is talk that the Administration plans to “wear the Southerners down” by keeping them talking week after week in regular day sessions. This plan, if serious, has overlooked the Southern capacity for talk. There remains, then, the compromise Mr. Russell, a realist, would happily settle for the deletion of the public accommodation section and that establishing a commission on equal employment opportunities. But can President Johnson throw in the public accommodations section, in which the Negroes have invested more emotion and more hopes than in any other? If he does, the House Republicans will almost certainly refuse to go along in conference. Of course, the Republicans may have to share the blame if Senate Minority Leader Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois continues adamant against the public accommodations section. But even so, the House Republicans may refuse to go along. The political issue would be just too good to surrender. Will, then, Senator Russell help out his old friend, President Lyndon Johnson, by calling off the filibuster in return for dropping F.E.P.C.? Maybe. But then again he may hold out for a bonus—say, dropping also of the section empowering, but not requiring, the President to cut off the funds from Federally‐aided programs where discrimination is practiced. The dimensions of the compromise will be clearer after a few weeks of Southern oratory.

513-> President and Congress
The struggle for power between the executive and legislative branches of the American Government is even older than the Constitution of the United States. It began as soon as the original thirteen colonies chose a Continental Congress. That Congress, true to later form, was convinced that it knew better than George Washington how to direct the strategy of the Revolutionary War. It even threatened on one occasion (the Conway cabal) to displace Washington as commander. Years later Congress attempted to take over an immense executive responsibility (in this case, a responsibility of Abraham Lincoln) when the Committee on the Conduct of the War was established in 1861. These are extreme instances, but they dramatize a contest which goes on almost uninterruptedly and of which we had our most recent example in the dispute over the President's power to negotiate the purely administrative details of the sale of American wheat to Russia. The real measure of the present rivalry for leadership between executive and legislature is to be found in the record of the first session of this same Congress which reconvened last Tuesday. To this Congress President Kennedy had recommended, among other things, a plan for tax reduction and reform, a new civil rights bill, a program of medical care under Social Security and various measures dealing with area redevelopment, mass transportation, civil defense, youth employment, S.E.C. amendments and the establishment of a conservation fund. Though Congress was in session for 356 days—the fifth longest session in history—no time could be found to take action on any of these proposals. What is most disturbing in this record is not that the judgment of Congress failed on all these measures to agree with the judgment of the Executive. There are and always will be instances in which the collective judgment of Congress is better than the collective judgment of the President and his advisers. The really disturbing fact is that even in a very long session not one of these measures was permitted to come to a conclusive vote in the House and Senate. Congress, in short, simply ignored the necessity of Presidential leadership. If the American system of democratic government is to cope successfully with the great new problems of the modern world, surely the minimum safety requirement is an assurance that proposals made by an American President will at least be brought to a Congressional vote—up or down—within a reasonable period after these proposals are submitted. This could be accomplished, in the House, by a revival and improvement of the “21‐day rule.” It would need more heroic treatment in the Senate to curb King Filibuster. But unless changes of this kind are made, unless the procedures of Congress are modernized, we seem certain to face increasingly grave dangers of drift and indecision.

Mobility plus new automatic features increased sales of the dictating machine industry last year, according to Lloyd M. Powell, president of the Dictaphone Corporation. In a year‐end summary, Mr. Powell said that the fact that today's executives are away from their offices more on business trips has also contributed to their greater reliance on dictating machines so they can keep their work up to date. Mr. Powell said the industry experienced strong competition last year from foreign concerns and domestic manufacturers.

The Free Democratic party, a member of the Bonn coalition Government, is considered close to industrialists and big business. “Diplomatic circles in Bonn are strongly interested in an alleged offer of five billion marks, with which Soviet authorities have asked German companies to participate in Premier Khrushchev's chemical program.” the newspaper stated. The Soviet Union has announced plans to increase its chemical‐plant capacity. The Russians are prepared to pay for the plants in cash, the newspaper continued.

517-> EX‐GOV. STRATTON INDICTED ON TAXES; Illinois Republican Accused of Evading Federal Levy
CHICAGO, April 15 — William G. Stratton, former Governor of Illinois, was indicted today on Federal incone tax charges. The indictment charged that Mr. Stratton, a Republican, had evaded $46,676 in taxes on unreported income of $82,542 for 1957 through 1960. A former United States Representative, whoat the age of 26 years in 1940 was one of the youngest persons ever elected to the House, Mr. Stratton was first elected Governor in 1952. He was defeated forreelection in 1960 by Otto Kerner, a Democrat. Except for a short time as a salesman in Morris, Ill., his home town, Mr. Stratton, the son of an Illinois Secretary of State, has devoted his life to politics. The maximum penalty for c nviction of the charges would be 20 years in prison and a $40;000 fine. A summons required Mr. Stratton to appear in court April 23. The indictment was returned last Thursday as the outgrowth of a Federal grand jury investigation that began last August. But the indictment was suppressed until today by Federal District Judge William J. Campbell, who said he had acted “to avoid the possibility of affecting an orderly election.” The Illinois primary election was held yesterday. Mr. Stratton had reportedly been an adviser to Charles H. Percy, who won the Republican nonination to run against Governor Kerner. The grand jury was reported‐ ly interested in the handling of small loan company licenses in the Stratton administration. The case was built on “the net worth theory.” Under this approach, investigators arrive at a figure for a suspect's spending and then measure this against known income and reserve capital. United States Attorney Edward V. Hanrahan said that Mr. Stratton's net worth increased “substantially” during his time in office. An Illinois Governor is paid $30,000 annually. According to the indictment, Mr. Stratton and his wife, Shirley, in joint tax returns for the four years reported total income of $86,097, on which they paid taxes of $23,311. Mrs. Stratton was not named in the indictment. Late in Mr. Stratton's first term as Governor, the state was rocked by a $2.5 million embezzlement by State Auditor Orville E. Hodge, who was convicted and imprisoned.

518-> SOYBEANS SLUMP BY 3¼ TO 7 CENTS; Decline in Week Reflects Rise in Open Interest
CHICAGO, Jan. 26 (AP)—The grain futures market stumbled into flurries of stop‐loss selling on the Board of Trade last week and closed with numerous losses, some of them fairly broad. At the close on Friday, wheat was down 1⅛ to 1¾ cents a bushel; corn, cent up to ⅛ down; oats, ⅛ to ¾ cent down; rye, 2½ cents up to 1⅛ cents down, and soybeans, 3¼ to 7 cents down. Soybeans were the hardest hit, mainly because of the large open interest, which continued to dwindle as discouraged speculators speeded liquidation toward apparent outright withdrawal from the market. At the close of trading Thursday, the open interest in all soybean contracts had shrunk to 298.4 million bushels, a decline of about 85 million since the record peak was reached a month ago. During the week, the Government issued its report on soybean crushings for December, which showed another decline from the comparable month a year ago and a total for the first three months of the crop year about 6.5 million below the same quarter of 1962. Although exports were described as brisk at times in wheat and corn, that category of business was not up to expectations for soybeans, although the total for the year finally did catch up with the volume at the same time last year. However, brokers pointed out that nothing moved overseas during January, 1963, because of a dockworkers' strike.

There was no other reference to the Chinese‐Soviet ideological dispute apart from that contained in the message to Mr. Khrushchev. A blackout was still being maintained here on news of the resumption of Soviet attacks on Chinese policy and the arrival of East European leaders in Moscow for Premier Khrushchev's birthday. Mao Tse‐tung, Chairman of the Chinese Communist party's Central Committee, and two of his top ideological lieutenants have been out of Peking for more than a week, possibly preparing a strong reply to Soviet charges.

524-> Spahn Institutes $175,000 Suit Over ‘Fictionalized’ Biography
Warren Spahn flew here from Milwaukee yesterday to testify against a writer and publisher of a biography of his life that allegedly contained inaccuracies and nonexistent conversations. Baseball's highest salaried pitcher and top‐winning lefthander spent the day in State Supreme Court as Warren E. Spahn, plaintiff. He is suing Milton J. Shapiro, a writer of several baseball biographies, over his book, “The Warren Spahn Story.” The pitcher claimed that the “fictionalized” book had caused him and his family embarrassment and anguish. Also named in the $175,000 invasion ‐ of ‐ privacy suit were Shapiro's publisher, Julian Messner, Inc., and the firm's president, Katherine G. Messner. Dressed in a sharply pressed brown business suit, the pitcher spent about two hours on the stand talking about his war record, his first baseball contract and the hours he used to spend pitching to his father. The baldish pitcher testified that, starting with page one, the book contained remarks that he doubted he ever made and that he never authorized Shapiro to use. Yesterday's court hearing developed late in the day into a wrangling exchange between opposing lawyers over what constituted “true or scholarly” biography. The only other witness to testify was Dr. John A. Garraty, professor of history at Columbia University and the author of “The Nature of Biographies,” who appeared for the plaintiff. He told the court that the use of nonexistent, quoted con‐ versations would lessen the validity of a biography as history. As a result, Earle W. Zaidins, Spahn's lawyer, said, the book did not represent true biographical reporting and therefore misled readers into believing it was an accurate story. For the 42‐year‐old Spahn, the court session was one of distant—and sometimes unpleasant—memories. While Justice Jacob Markowitz and lawyers obviously enjoyed the articulate pitcher's version of World Series games and ninth‐inning strikeouts mentioned in the book, the testimony often turned to such somber items as the type of Nazi planes that attacked his unit at the Remagen Bridge on the Rhine in World War II. Spahn received shrapnel wounds in his right foot in the attack. Shapiro, on the first page of his book, wrote: “Spahn glanced anxiously up at the sky. .. `Stukas again,' he muttered bitterly to himself.” Shapiro wrote that Spahn won the Bornze Star, which the pitcher said was not so. The writer stated that Spahn's father had signed his first contract for him with the Milwaukee Braves in 1939 because the 18‐year‐old pitcher was a minor. Spahn testified that his father was in the hospital at the time and that his mother signed. Spahn had planned to end his testimony yesterday, but extended discussion over defining legal and literary points forced Justice Markowitz to adjourn the non‐jury trial until Feb. 10, when Spahn wi1I return for what probably wilI be a paragraph ‐ by ‐ paragraph examination of the book.

527-> SOYBEAN FUTURES DECLINE AT CLOSE; Traders Await Report on Farm Stocks in U. S.
CHICAGO, Jan. 10 (UPI)—Soybeans led most grain futures downward today on the Board of Trade. Wheat was unchanged to down ½ of a cent a bushel, corn to up ¼, oats unchanged to down ¼,rye unchanged to clown ⅝ and soybeans unchanged to down 2⅝. Soybean prices fell back from steady positions to show losses as much as 2⅝ at the close. Traders were apparently awaiting new developments such as the Government report on farm stocks due later in the afternoon. Japan bought 149,000 bushels of soybeans for February‐March shipment. The wheat market was quiet. Scattered selling offset some commercial buying. New contracts were easier from lack of support. Norway bought 560.000 bushels of hard wheat and Brazil 747,000 bushels.

528-> ARY BARROSO DEAD; COMPOSED ‘BRAZIL’
RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 10—Ary Boroso, composer of popular Brazilian music, died last night. He was 60 years old. His death came during the pre‐Lenten Carnival season, for which he had written about 500 sambas and marches over the years. Mr. Barroso was perhaps bestknown in the United States for his songs “Bahia,” called here “Aquarelo do Brasil,” and “Brazil.” Many other songs of his were popularized in Hollywood by the late Carmen Miranda. He also wrote music for Walt Disney, particularly the cartoon character Joe Carioca.

529-> Exports Maintain a Record Pace
WASHINGTON, April 7—Exports in February held close to the record levels reached in December and January, the Department of Commerce reported today. For the three months together, the annual rate of exports was $24,462,000,000, well above that of any three‐ month period in the past. With imports holding roughly steady, the nation's trade surplus—the excess of exports over imports—was at an annual rate of $7 billion for the December‐February period, as mentioned by Pres‐ ident Johnson in his news conference last Saturday. This large trade surplus was an important factor in the sharp improvement in the United States balance of payments in the first quarter of this year. The President emphasized today his continued commitment to expanding exports “if we are to keep our currency sound, as we intend to do.” The President, speaking to the Cabinet Committee for Export Expansion, added that export expansion could also help in creating jobs and eliminating poverty. Today's report put commercial exports for February, seasonally adjusted, at $2,028,700,000. This compared with $2,049,000,000 in December and $2,037,300,000 in January. Thus, the three months showed a very slight declining trend from the December peak. Imports in February, after seasonal adjustment, were $1,445,300,000, against $1,429,900,000 in January and $1,480,050,000 in December. For the three‐month period, exports at an annual rate of $24,462,000,000 were 4 per cent higher than in the preceding three months. Imports in the DecemberFebruary period fell by 1 per cent from the level of the preceding three months to an annual rate of $17.421.000.000. Government officials cautioned today that the huge $7 billion annual rate of trade surplus might not be maintained in the months to come. In particular, they expect imports to rise as the economy expands.

530-> THE BEST OF THE JAPANESE MAPLES
THE current trend toward smaller houses and yards spurs interest in scaleddown trees for the landscape. The Japanese maples comprise an unusually handsome group of plants which merit serious consideration. These trees exhibit wide variety in forms, heights at maturity, leaf patterns and spring, summer and fall foliage colors. They have graceful habit. The shrubby types have round or globular shapes while the taller‐growing, more vigorous kinds have a somewhat open, vaselike crown. Heights vary from dwarf shrubs to small shade trees 20 to 25 feet tall. The leaves are moderately to deeply segmented into five to 11 lobes with some varieties so deeply dissected they appear skeletonized. Aside from their picturesque, irregular habits, the Japanese maples are perhaps best known in this country for their red‐colored foliage. Leaf colors vary, however, from light greens through yellows, bronzes, scarlets to dark reds and purples. Several forms have curiously variegated foliage. While these are unusual in appearance, they are less hardy, slower in growth and difficult to fit harmoniously into the landscape. American gardeners prefer the red or purple types. The Japanese favor the greenleaved forms for their strikingly handsome fall colors. In Japan the maple is called the “autumn welcoming tree” and it is planted in the western portion of gardens (the direction from which fall comes). The attractive foliage and forms of the Japanese maples have long made them popular favorites for home and park landscaping both in this country and abroad. The trees' natural tendency toward basal branching makes them suitable where low‐growing and spreading kinds of informal plants are desired. They are superb for rock or Japanese‐ style gardens and are handsome specimen plants in full sun or partial shade. Tall‐growing forms can be trained as single or multiplestemmed, small shade trees or for planting in patios or courtyards. Smaller types make interesting plants for patios, decks, foyers and lobbies when potted in attractive containers. These plants should be watered adequately and protected from both the wind and harsh sunlight. The Japanese maples are varieties and forms of two species: Acer japonicum of Japan, Korea and Manchuria and A. palmatum of Japan and eastern China. Both are shrubs or small trees with seedlings of the two species showing great variation in habit and in leaf patterns and colors. Over 80 forms have been recognized, many with names difficult to pronounce, spell and remember. Variations among some are not easy to determine; many may be incorrectly identified. The japonicums have leaves three to six inches across with seven to 11 ovate lobes, palmately arranged like the fingers and thumb on your hand Their branches and leaf and flower stems are covered with soft, downy hairs, especially during the period of spring growth. The flowers are purple, larger and more attractive than those in the palmatum group. This is a favorite maple of the Japanese who call it the feather‐fan‐shaped maple. An American namefor this species is the fullmoon maple. A form with yellow mature leaves is called golden fullmoon maple. Most popular of the japonicums is aconitifolium, fernleaf maple, with green leaves lobed nearly to the petiole and the segments cut in the fernlike fashion. The foliage changes to rich ruby crimson in autumn. The palmatums—generally referred to as the Japanese maples—have leaves two to four inches across with five to nine oblong lobes ending in more pointed tips than those of the japonicums. The purple flowers are smaller and downy hairs are absent on the branchlets and leaf and flower stems. This is the larger group of the two containing five varieties, over 70 forms and a large number of unnamed seedlings. Variety palmatum Thunberg has green leaves with five to nine oblong lanceolate, coarsely and deeply serrated lobes. Forms include the flame dwarf or bloodleaf Japanese maple with red to purple mature leaves. NomuraNishiki has blood red leaves with brown and lighter variegations. Versicolor has green leaves with white, pink and light green variegations. Scolopendifolium is a form with green leaves cut to the centers with narrow segments. YezoNishiki has blood red leaves with vermilion variegations while sanguineum has purplered mature leaves. Variety dissectum, threadleaf, has leaves divided to the base in five to nine fernlike lobes. Spiderleaf or laceleaf Japanese maple is ornatum, a somewhat weeping form with leaves deep red changing to bronze and russet greens. Linearilobum, fin gerlobe Japanese maple, has leaves divided nearly to the base with linear lobes slightly serrated or nearly entire. Atrolineare, a form with dark red mature leaves, is the bloodvine Japanese maple. Heptalobum has sevenlobed leaves, broader than in the other varieties, with doubly serrated edges. Reticulatum is a curious form with yellowgreen leaves, green margins and darker colored veins giving a netlike effect. Ohsakazuki, with light yellow‐green leaves changing to blood red, is considered to be one of the most brilliant of all in fall coloration. Rubrum, the red Japanese maple, has deep red spring and autumn foliage with red to bronze ‐ green leaves throughout the summer months. Japanese maples are not especially fussy as to soils but do best in soils that are fertile, deep, well‐drained and on the neutral side. Partially shaded situations are preferred, but most forms will prove satisfactory in full sunlight. Young plants and the new growth on older specimens are quite sensitive to frost so these maplesshould be placed where they receive protection from the cold winds of early spring. They are shallow rooted plants and must be regularly and adequately watered during dry periods to prevent scorching of the foliage. The trees are generally hardy in the northern and middle states where temperatures do not fall below five to 10 degrees below zero. Leaf and twig buds of the Japanese maples are arranged in opposite pairs on the branches so that terminals rarely occur. In the shrubby and weeping forms, any strong upright shoots should be pinched out or nipped back to their bases to preserve the symmetry of the plants. In the tree types, however, where height is desired, strong shoots toward the centers should be favored in order that one or more sturdy main trunks may develop. “True‐to‐type” maples are propagated from softwood cuttings taken from young plants or grafted or budded on seedling stocks. Tree forms and those with weeping characteristics are most often grafted or budded high on sturdy transplants grown from the seed of the taller growing types. Japanese maples that are grafted or budded highespecially those with spindly trunks — should be carefully staked when planted until they become wind‐firm. Any buds or shoots arising below the unions should be rubbed or cut off as they appear. Otherwise, a two‐toned plant will result or the more vigorous stock might “take‐over” the varietal top.

531-> IRENE THIRER, 59, MOVIE REVIEWER; New York Post Film Editor Dies—Once With News
Irene Thirer, motion picture editor of The New York Post and one of the nation's senior movie critics, died at Doctors Hospital yesterday after a long illness. She was 59 years old and lived at 306 East 96th Street. Miss Thirer (in private life Mrs. Zac Freedman) had watched movies and written about them since 1925, two years before the advent of talking pictures. Over the years, she interviewed the stars and the studio greats and, generally, wrote gentle criticisms of films. As a newspaperwoman on the movie beat, Miss Thirer was respected and liked by both colleagues and by people who worked in the film industry, where sharp criticism and venomous gossip were as often the rule as the exception. Miss Thirer was born in London. Her family came to New York in 1910. She attended school here, studying at New York University and City College. In 1921, fresh out of high school, Miss Thirer went to work at The Daily News, then only two years old, and soon became a picture‐caption writer, winning prizes for her descriptions of photographs. Four years later, she began writing about movies. She was one of the persons on the staff who developed the one‐two‐threefour star system of film appraisal still used by The News. In 1935, she moved to The New York Post, where for nearly 30 years she wrote her interviews and reviews As chairman of tne New York Film Critics in 1957, Miss Thirer presented Ingrid Bergman with an award for her prize‐winning performance in the 1956 film “Anastasia.” Surviving besides her husband, apress agent, are a son, Charles; a daughter, Mrs. Lee Townsend; two sisters, Mrs. Marjory Geiss and Mrs. Richard P. McKeon; and a grandson, Laird Townsend. A funeral service will be held Friday at Frank E. Campbell's at Madison Avenue and East 81st Street.

532-> STATE COURT IN INDIA BATTLING ASSEMBLY
NEW DELHI, March 24—A constitutional conflict has arisen in Uttar Pradesh over a warrant issued by the state's legislature for the arrest of two High Court justices. The Assembly acted after the two justices, N. U. Beg and G. P Sehgal, released on bail a Socialist party worker, Keshav Singh. He had been found in contempt of the legislature and sentenced by it to seven days in prison. Mr. Singh was arrested by the Assembly 10 days ago on charges of having published leaflets that it considered derogatory to a member. The two justices released him on a writ of habeas corpus. The Assembly demanded his rearrest and the appearance of the justices for disciplining. Yesterday, 28 of the 33 justices of the state's High Court ordered a stay of execution of the legislative resolution for the arrest of Justices Beg and Sehgal. Nevertheless, the Speaker of the Assembly issued an arrest warrant last night. The High Court ordered that it not be executed. The two justices are at liberty while the central Government awaits advice from the Attorney General.

533-> Soviet Star Sees Olympic Victory; Lidiya Skoblikova Is Confident of Sweep by Women Skaters
MOSCOW, Jan. 17 — Lidiya Skoblikova, the world speedskating champion, predicted today that the Soviet Union would sweep the women's speed‐skating events at the Winter Olympics, which open Jan. 29 at Innsbruck, Austria. The 24‐year‐old slightly built blonde, who won gold medals in the 1,500 and 3,000 meter races at Squaw Valley, Calif., four years ago, said unsmilingly: “We will pick up silver and bronze medals. too.” The physical education instructor from Chelyabinsk in the Urals became the champion last February when she won all four distance events in the world comnetition in Japan. Sitting next to her in the Soviet State Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries was Yevgeny Grishin. Grishin, a 32‐year‐old skater, looked up from his doodling when asked about Soviet men's chances. “I cannot say the same,” he said. “We will have strong competition. I'm busy with my own problems, but I know the boys are ready to put up a good fight.” At Squaw Valley in 1960, Grishin paced his country by virtually duplicating his 1956 performance at Cortina d'Amezzo, Italy, winning the 500‐meter event and tying for the 1,500‐meter title. Asked to comment on Americans, the Soviet Army man said he considered William Disney of Alhambra, Calif., his most dangerous rival. Disney placed second in the 500‐meter race at Squaw Valley. The two men met again in pre‐Olympic competition in Norway this week. Yuri D. Mashin, who as chairman of the Central Council of Soviet Sport Societies is the country's top athletic official, said that “feeling of patriotism may play a decisive role” in the Olympic competition. He noted that 55 of the 74 Soviet athletes taking part in the Winter Games were members of the Communist party or Young Communist League. Mashin said that only onethird of this year's Olympic team had taken part in previous Winter Games. The Soviet Union first competed in 1956, winning seven gold, three silver and six bronze medals. It took first place both then and at Squaw Valley in the unofficial team standing. The Soviet Union will take part in 28 of the 34 scheduled events this year. It will not participate in the bobsled and toboggan races because these sports are not practiced by Russians. Nor will there be Soviet entries in the women's single figure skating. The best representation will be in speed‐skating, with 11 men and six women, and in cross‐country skiing, with nine men and five women. The Russians also hope to regain the ice hockey crown they won in 1956 and yielded to the United States at Squaw Valley.

Surviving are his widow, Jennie; two sons, Irving and Chester; four grandchildren and five great‐grandchildren.

535-> UNION MAN ASKING BAN ON OVERTIME; Teamster Leader on Coast Also Against Moonlighting
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 14 —A drive to end overtime work and moonlighting has been opened by the director of the 400,000‐member Western Conference of Teamsters. Einar O. Mohn, based in this city, spoke to teamsters of the Denver area last night. He was in Portland Friday. He goes to Seattle early next month, then plans a speech in Phoenix and wants to make a pitch in Anchorage, Alaska, before the end of February. He has already spoken in Los Angeles. “If we could eliminate all unnecessary overtime—all except that created by emergencies,” he said in an interview here, ”and if we could put a curb on moonlighting—the holding of second jobs—we could conservatively put 80,000 teamsters back to work in the West. And it wouldn't take any grants from foundations or any Harvard or California professors to do it.” Mr. Mohn, who has directed the Western Conference of Teamsters since 1958, heads a six‐man labor group in a new California commission appointed by Gov. Edmund G. Brown. The commission is to study manpower, automation and technology and their relationships to the economy. “I'm not trying to say that labor by itself is going to solve the automation and unemployment problem,” Mr. Mohn said “But I think we will have a more valid right to complain about government and employers if we make an honset pitch ourselves with what could be called, I suppose, a sacrifice.” He noted proposals in some segments of labor to reduce the general 40‐hour week to 35 or 32 hours. “But if a shorter work week is going to be one of the effective weapons to fight unemployment,” he asserted, “we'd better get rid of overtime and moonlighting before we adopt the shorter week. Otherwise, we are going to encourage greater uses of overtime and moonlighting. It would be disastrous if the shorter week came too fast.” Negotiations will start shortly between teamster‐affiliated cannery unions and California canners and processors of vegetables and fruits over one specific proposal advanced by the teamsters union. Briefly, this calls for the setting up of an employe benefit trust fund into which processors pay 5 cents for every case of products canned. This is estimated at 20 cents an hour a worker. John H. Dillon, president of the California State Council of Cannery and Food Processing Units, has said employment has dropped by 40,000 in recent years because of technological advances in the industry.

537-> Presidential Papers Missing Since 1962 Found in Detroit
DETROIT, Jan. 6 (AP)—The Federal Bureau of Investigation identified today documents found in a couple's apartment as historical material taken from the National Archives in Washington in 1962. The documents were reported valued at more than $500.000. The F. B. I. charged Robert Bradford Murphy, 45 years old, and his wife Elizabeth, 32, with interstate transportation of stolen property and theft of Government property. They were arrested by the F. B. I. Thursday. The 50 documents included letters written by President James Monroe and letters signed by Presidents Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Grover Cleveland, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy. One was from Gen. Robert E. Lee to Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States. Mrs.Murphyis out on $10,000 personal bond. Her husband is in the custodyof the United States marshal in lieu of $25,000 bond. They will be arraigned tomorrow.

538-> UNIONS BEDEVILED BY UNEMPLOYMENT; High Rate Cuts Down Their Membership and Weakens Bargaining Position
WASHINGTON—For the nation's unions, the year just ended was one of disappointment and frustration. The central fact of life on the labor front was the continuing high level of unemployment. The year ended as it began, with the unemployment rate pushing 6 per cent of the labor force. The Administration's chief proposal to reduce unemployment is a tax cut of $11 billion to stimulate the economy. The President's Council of Economic Advisers estimated that the cut would create two to three million jobs and reduce the unemployment rate to about 4 per cent by early 1964, when its full economic impact would be felt. Union economists regard this estimate as far too optimistic, but the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations is backing the tax‐cut proposal on the ground that it is better than nothing. What the federation would really like is a big increase in Government expenditure. The relatively high level of unemployment has meant, for the unions, diminished membership and a weakened position at the bargaining table. It vastly complicated their major chore in negotiations—to work out ways of protecting their members from the impact of automation and other forms of technological change that are cutting into the ranks of the unskilled and semi‐skilled and remaking the country's occupational map. The year brought tangible evidence that the unions' concerns were not idle speculation. A Labor Department report put total union membership of national and international unions with headquarters in the United States at 12,630,000 in 1962. This was a drop of nearly 500,000 members in two years. The loss was concentrated in manufacturing, a principal center of union strength. One set of Government fig‐ ures also showed a marked decrease in the size of union wage gains. Another showed that the annual rate of increase of output per man‐hour in the private nonfarm economy was rising, but that the percentage of gain in nonfarm earnings was dropping off. The conclusion that the unions drew from these statistics was that they were not getting a fair share. The effect of this may be evident in the most important negotiations scheduled for this year — the talks between the United Automobile Workers of America and the car makers. There is speculation that the union may soft‐pedal demands for job and income security and put the emphasis on pay. Whatever happens in Detroit, however, the principal concern atthe bargaining table in many industries will still be how to adjust to technological change. Perhaps the most significant labor relations development of 1963 was that it saw the beginning of a consensus between the unions and management on how the problem should be handled. The gist of the consensus, expressed in a number of contract settlements, is that the introduction of automated equipment and other technologicalinnovations should proceed, but that workers ought to share in the gains and be protected from the impact. The degree of protection was a matter for hard bargaining in 1963. It will continue to be this year. However, some breakthroughs were made last year that would seem to augur well for the ultimate victory of reason over conflict. The Southern Pacific Railroad and the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks signed a contract covering 11,000 employes that provides that the abolition of permanent positions be restricted to natural attrition—resignations. deaths and retirements. The Kaiser Steel Corporation and the United Steelworkers of America agreed on an elaborate savings‐sharing plan. It provides guarantees against layoffs as a result of technological change and gives the workers a share of the cost savings from more efficient operation and other sources. The bargaining technique used to reach the Kaiser agreement was perhaps more significant than the agreement itself. It was the product of a threeyear study by a committee composed of union and management officials and three neutral members who are experts in industrial relations. The committee's work was conducted without the pressure of a strike deadline and a crisis atmosphere. More unions and managements have concluded that the problems they face cannot be solved rationally through crisis bargaining. Such negotiatingdevices as theKaiser committee are spreading. In the steel industry, for example, the Human Relations Committee, set up in 1960, assumed a new and more important role in negotiations. The settlement of a contract reopener was worked out by the union and the steel industry entirely within the framework of the committee, without recourse to formal bargaining in the traditional sense. The study committee device has spread to other industries, including automobiles. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service is working, through a preventive mediation program, to 'encourage its spread. And the American Arbitration Association recently announced that it was undertaking a new program to help unions and managements devise bargaining systems that are more adequate to the needs of the times. Despite these encouraging signs, however, there have been bargaining failures. The worst was in the railroad industry, where the inability of the nation's carriers and the five operating rail unions to agree on solutions in their four‐year work rules dispute forced Congress to pass the nation's first peacetime law providing for compulsory arbitration of a labor dispute. Another failure occurred in the New York newspaper industry, where a combined strike and lockout shut the city's newspapers for 114 days, dragging to a weary close at the end of March. The first industry on the agenda of the Arbitration Association's new program is newspaper publishing. One effect of these and other failures of the bargaining system has been a growing awareness that the system has limits in the area of technological change. This has led the Labor Department under Labor Secretary W. Willard Wirtz to begin a program of labor‐management services designed to help the bargainers work out solutions and gear Federal retraining programs into the settlements, where appropriate. One pioneering exercise in which the department already is engaged is an extensive study of manpower utilization and job security problems on the East Coast docks. Provision for the study was made early last year when the East Coast longshore strike was settled. If the study leads to successful resolution of automation issues in the next round of longshore contract negotiations, it will undoubtedly pave the way for similar Government efforts in other industries.

539-> Elegies To Love; THE POEMS OF PROPERTIUS. Trans­lated by Constance Carrier. 224 pp. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. $4.95.
PROPERTIUS has fared badly in terms of literary history. A writer of love elegies contemporary with Horace and Vergil, and with the same patron, Maecenas, he remains scarcely more than a name to those not familiar with Augustan poetry. Despite the bulk of his writing—roughly comparable to Horace's Odes—there is still no critical book on him in English, nor has there been a translation for 30 years. The primary reason for his neglect is simply his difficulty. The Latin often seems darkness visible; the number and esoteric quality of the mythological allusions is forbidding. And not only is the text notoriously corrupt—editors have felt free to revise and transpose lines wholesale — but the discontinuity of his thought is remarkable, to the point where one sometimes feels that we have not so much a corpus of poems as a set of rather carelessly disposed The result has been to restrict his enjoyment, if that be the word, to specialists, and their scornful reaction to Pound's quasi‐translations (“Homage to Sextus Propertius”) suggests how zealously the preserve has been guarded. Many of these difficulties have been obviated if not removed by Constance Carrier's version. Its great virtue is to make Propertius readily accessible, though scholars may claim that it is a misrepresentation to do so. The rendering is free; lines are omitted, others expanded; mythological allusions are pared. Sometimes it is easy to feel that a little too much logic, consistency or even blandness has been imposed. Yet, more generally and more importantly, a faithful picture of an extraordinary sensibility, both powerful and elegant, does emerge. Propertius has recently been claimed as one of the first Romantics, and, more particularly, as an early example of Freud's the love of a prostitute. He alternates between exaltation and despair, pleas for freedom and professions of servitude; he has only scorn for those “whose unperilous loves pursue their placid course.” His analogy for his own passion is that of a man being roasted alive in the bull of Perillus. A suggestive parallel: that ingenious artifact was so constructed that the cries of those burned inside emerged as sweet music, as the inventor himself proved. Goethe confessed to tapping out the rhythms of his hexameters upon the back of his sleeping mistress, and the union of lover and poet in Propertius is hardly less explicit: “My joy is to lie in her arms and read to her and leave that keen intelligence satisfied.” Rejecting the traditional forms of inspiration, he claimed that it was his mistress Cynthia alone, not Apollo or a Muse, that made him a poet, and when a rival threatens to steal Cynthia it is not from Propertius—as Miss Carrier has it—but “from my songs.” CATULLUS may have been the first to assert that love could be a serious experience, and Propertius made the assertion programmatic: for him, love was a career. His self‐conscious pride in being a lover rather than a politician or general (“Caesar's glorious in war, but what to love are all his conquered nations?”) was equaled only by his pride in his own fine‐spun verse as opposed to epic. In choosing a “delicate wreath” rather than a “weighty crown,” he intended that it should endure no shorter time. ”My Muse is your renown, however slight. Who else can praise so well my girl's dark eyes, or say how soft her hands, her step how light?“ Miss Carrier has used, by and large, an informal four‐line stanzaic arrangement, a more felicitous choice for Propertius's elegiacs than the usual heroic couplet. What Propertius asked of his own verse is admirably illustrated by her own: “Let the rhythms run smoothly — but they must be polished first.” The tone of his elegies, or even that of a single elegy, often shifts from a harshly individual vehemence to an Ovidian slickness, and these modulations are nicely preserved. The blemishes are minor, and somewhat academic in nature. To have presented so difficult and exciting a poet so well is no mean achievement. There are also a persuasive introduction and helpful notes by Palmer Bovie.

SOUTH BEND, Ind., Feb. 17 (AP)—Notre Dame lost a 16point lead but rallied to defeat St. John's, 89–83, tonight. The Irish hit on 56 per cent of their shots from the field in the first half and led, 53–37, at intermission. St. John's caught up at 64–64 midway in the second half and went ahead, 74–72. Larry Sheffield of Notre Dame then hit three straight baskets and the Irish led the rest of the way.

543-> President, in Note, Cautions Sukarno On Malaysia Issue
JAKARTA, Indonesia, Jan. 6—President Johnson has told President Sukarno that the Malaysian crisis forms a major obstacle to better IndonesianAmerican relations.The informants said the message to Mr. Sukarno also had affirmed that Mr. Johnson planned to continue the policies of President Kennedy. They said the message had been received well by the Indonesian leader, who has kept his country unaligned in the East‐West power struggle. Highly placed sources, who declined to be identified, said today that the United States view was conveyed in a letter from Mr. Johnson that Ambassador Howard P. Jones handed to the Indonesian leader last week. It was said to have noted good American‐Indonesian relations in the past and to have declared that further improvement would be difficult under present circumstances. Indonesia opposes neighboring Malaysia. The United States has declared it backs Malaysia. The American view has been that the three nations involved in the crisis—Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines—should get together and discuss their problems in a peaceful manner. Mr. Jones has met Mr. Sukarno twice since returning from the United States last week after a two‐month holiday and consultations in Washington. The Ambassador saw President Kennedy the night before he left for Dallas, where he was killed. The informants said Mr. Jones had tried to allay Indonesian fears that possible United States Seventh Fleet movements into the Indian Ocean—called the Indonesian Ocean here—had anything to do with Indonesia. The issue has raised protests here, including a shortlived demonstration in front of the United States Embassy Christmas Eve.

546-> NEPAL GETS HELP OF EAST AND WEST; Aid Projects Sped by China, Russia, U. S. and India
KATMANDU, Nepal—Moskvich cars are traveling in Katmandu's streets and Communist Chinese radio sets are blaring music in Nepalese homes, marking a new way of life in this Himalayan capital. Already $4.5 million worth of goods, ranging from nail clippers to heavy tricks, have entered Nepalese markets. Three times this volume is still to arrive to finance local costs of Chinese and Russian projects. Meanwhile, aid also continues from the United States and India. Work is proceeding on the Katmandu‐Kodari road that will connect the Nepalese capital with Lhasa, giving Chinese garrisons in Tibet access to the rice bowl of eastern Nepal. Peking, meanwhile, has scrapped a plan for a cement factory here as uneconomical. It has cut the size of a proposed papermill because of the inability to obtain parts from Czechoslovakia, a result of the Communist ideological quarrel. To save their sagging prestige, the Chinese are promising to build other projects instead—a rice mill and a flour mill, of which Nepal seems to have little need. The Russians, on the other hand, are going ahead steadily with their projects—a sugar mill, cigarette factory, and a small hydroelectric station. More Russian aid is promised in the form of a farm implements factory, a hundredkilometer road. At the same time, the United States and India are providing $10 million and $8 million a year, respectively, to improve Nepal's agriculture, industry, education and roads. The United States has just constructed a $5 million ropeway to transport goods in and out of Katmandu across mountains and valleys, a $2 million telephone exchange for Katmandu and model agricultural farms in the southern plains. Indian aid has provided modern airports at Sima, Janakpur and Pokhara; Nepal's biggest hydro‐electric project over the Trishuli River; an industrial estate near Katmandu to produce furniture, metalware and plastic goods, and water supply systems for the Katmandu and Pokhara Valleys. The regime of King Mahendras said most of the targets in the first year of a threeyear, $95‐million development plan had been achieved.

WASHINGTON, May 7 (UPI) —The National Geographic Society reported today that a Norwegian ski expedition was almost halfway to the North Pole in a journey from Canada over the top of the world to Europe. A society spokesman said the six‐man team was last reported near Arlis‐II, a United States weather station on a floating ice island in the Arctic. It is about half the distance between the pole and the team's starting point in Alert, Ellesmere Island, Canada. Headed by Bjorn Staib of Oslo, the Norwegian team is the first foot expedition to make the pole journey through ice and snow since Adm. Robert Perry discovered the North Pole on April 6, 1909.

550-> In and Out of Children's Books
THE writing of children's books used to be regarded as the special province of genteel ladies of a certain age. That this is so no longer can be seen by a glance at some of the books coming along in the near future — books signed by some of the most unlikely names imaginable. First of all, there is Ian Fleming's first children's book, to be published by Random House under the title of “Chitty ‐ Chitty ‐ Bang ‐ Bang.” According to a disguised operative in the local office of SMERSH (“Death to Spies”) this is a fantasy about a car, license plate GEN 11 (“genii”) the title representing the sound of the car as it moves along. When he finished writing, Mr. Fleming was all for signing it with a nom de plume, not through a sense of shame, but out of regard for his 11‐year‐old son now at school. Mr. Fleming felt that schoolmates, while accepting anyone whose old man wrote the James Bond tales, might crack down on the heir of anyone dreaming up a “ChittyChitty ‐ Bang ‐ Bang.” Cooler heads prevailed, and when it comes out, the book will be signed by Ian Fleming. Another on the list for a first children's book is Carson McCullers, normally the author of brooding stories of the South (“Ballad of the Sad Cafe”). Her book will be “Sweet as a Whistle and Clean as a Pig,” a collection of short verses mainly suggested by incidents of her childhood. She had been setting them down for her own amusement over a number of years, with no thought of a book. Joyce Hartman, an editor for Houghton Mifflin, saw one or two of them, asked to see the rest, with the result that H M will publish. Roald Dahl, who with his right hand writes some of the most macabre stories imaginable, and with his left has done a children's book or so before, will have a realistic fantasy, “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” on the Knopf list. . . . Mary McCarthy, who— well, everyone knows about “The Group”—will be doing an introduction to two of Dickens's stories, “Captain Boldheart” and “The Magic Fishbone” for Macmillan. . . . Eudora Welty will have a fantasy, “The Shoebird,” on the Harcourt, Brace & World list. . . . Gerald Durrell, one of the adult world's best historians of the animal world, will turn to the children again, via Viking, with “The New Noah.” This is a factual account of collecting animals in Africa. LAST year, there were about 2,300 children's book titles published in the United States. This year, at the halfway mark of the end of June, there will be over 1,000. Since the weight of the publishing year comes with the fall — the aim, of course, is Christmas — it seems certain that 1964's output will match, if not go beyond, that of 1963. As to the sales of children's books, it has been estimated that 80 per cent are bought by schools and libraries, only 20 per cent sold through bookstores or in other retail fashion. This latter low percentage is one of the many subjects over which bookstore owners and book publishers continue to quarrel. The store owners contend that publishers seem content with the library sales, letting the retail sales go by default through lack of promotion, the offering of too many titles, the publishing of books aimed at the supermarkets. The publishers contend that since the bookstores are there to sell books, they should try harder — including the hiring of personnel knowing something about them, and displays at the front of the store, not hidden away at the back. Some of the stores are doing just that, including their operation through home territory of their own bookmobiles. AS a part of its efforts to substitute baseball gloves for switchknives on the streets, this city's Police Athletic League each year holds a literary contest for its members, teenagers and down. For a number of years Joy Chute, the novelist, has been contest director, and this year the subject for the essays was “The Book Character I Would Most Like To Meet —and Why.” A new high mark of 530 essays were submitted, including a beguiling one by a young lady who wanted to meet Frankenstein's monster, with the first prize going to Susan Winkler, 14, of 560 West 218th Street, for the following: “From my recent years of reading, the book character that has impressed me most is Santiago, the Spanish fisherman, from ‘The Old Man and the Sea,’ by Ernest Hemingway. “Santiago was somewhere in his late eighties, and by his appearance you could certainly tell. Everything about him was old, except his eyes which were the color of the sea, and his undefeated attitude towards life. He never gave up, facing every crisis in a cheerful manner. He did not believe in counting years, but in enjoying every minute of life, until they suddenly stopped. “There are very few men like Santiago living today. Too many of us have given up hope, far before we reach his age. It would be a rewarding experience for anyone to meet such a man, and if more were alive rather than fictional characters, the world might be a better place to live in.” THE children's book field has three main awards—corresponding to the Pulitzer Prizes and National Book Awards in the adult world. They are the Newbery Medal for most distinguished contribution to American literature far children, the Caldecott Medal for distinguished picture book, the Child Study Association award for best book of the year. Here is how this year's winners received the news of the same: Emily Neville, Newbery winner for “It's Like This, Cat,” was about to polish her children's shoes when the telephone rang with word of the prize. She dropped the shoes, went to the library to see who previous winners had been. Maurice Sendak, Caldecott winner for “Where the Wild Things Are,” heard the news the second he replaced his telephone on its cradle, having taken it off during an extended and unhappy bout with insomnia eight hours before. Mildred Lee and Betty Schechter, who shared the Child Study Associaton's award for “The Rock and the Willow” and “The Peaceable Revolution,” respectively, got the word by letter, the one in St. Petersburg, Fla., the other in Kingston, Pa. Said the latter; “The book tells the background of the American Civil Rights revolution, the most exciting and challenging of our time. It seemed only logical that the C.S.A. would think so, too.” TWENTY‐FIVE years ago this October, a tug wandered up and down through New York Harbor. On board were such people as Christopher Morley, Reginald Marsh, marine artist Gordon Grant, Anne Carroll Moore, Buckminster Fuller, and the purpose was to properly launch Hardie Gramatky's saga of a tug, “Little Toot.” Since that time, the title has pretty much gone into the language as an affectionate name for tug—and about a quarter‐million copies of the book have gone into the hands of a Toot‐conscious public. This autumn, there will be another tugboat ride through the harbor, this time to launch a companion volume, Mr. Gramatky's “Little Toot on the Thames.” A movie company would think nothing of flying everyone over to London for a pleasant and extended trip on a proper tug on the proper Thames, but this is Putnam's.

551-> NOTES FROM JULE STYNE; Four of His Scores Will Be Played This Week
BOSTON. WHEN “Fade Out—Fade In,” the new musical starring Carol Burnett, opens on Tuesday at the Mark Hellinger, Jule Styne, who composed its score, will have put together a unique parlay. Within a period of two months four major productions for which he has written the music will have opened in New York. Styne has always been an unusually energetic composer. Starting in Hollywood 25 years ago where, as he says, “I was trying to write Richard Rodgers songs for Roy Rogers,” he turned out hit song after hit song — “I’ll Walk Alone,” “Five Minutes More,” “I’ve Heard That Song Before,” “It's Been a Long, Long Time” (50 Styne songs reached the Hit Parade; one, “Three Coins in the Fountain,” won the Academy Award). On Broadway he has composed the scores for nine shows including “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,” “Do‐Re‐Mi,” “Bells Are Ringing” and “Gypsy” and has added such lasting favorites to the musical theater repertory as “Just in Time,” “Make Someone Happy” and “The Party's Over.” Butfor even as bubbling a well of creativity as Styne, his current torrent of activity has been remarkable. It began with “Funny Girl” which made its bow at the Winter Garden on March 26. For this Barbra Streisand vehicle, Styne wrote 50 songs, 22 of which remained in the show. For the film, “What a Way to Go,” starring Shirley MacLeine, currently on view at both the Criterion and the Sutton, he provided four. To “Wonder World” at the World's Fair, he has contributed 11,with lyrics by his son, Stanley Styne. “Fade Out —Fade In” has 15, culled from the 32 he composed for it. On the side, he has served as co‐producer of both “Fade Out—Fade In” and another musical, for which he did not write the score, “High Spirits.” And, earlier in the season, he wrote the background score for the Bertolt Brecht play, “Arturo Ui.” Much of this activity is based on Styne's conviction that, at 58, he isin a desperate race with the calendar. He is a short, stocky man with a bouyant, bright‐eyed interest in everything that is goingon around him. But he can grow whimsically wistful when he considers his plight. “I’m not a boy any longer,” he declares. “I started so late in the theater”—(his first show was “High Button Shoes” in 1947)—"—“and I have so much that I want to say musically.” Yet, in case it might seem bad manners to occupy so much of the entertainment seeker's immediate attention, he would like to pass off this present concentration of pro ductivity as merely bad management. All he had really intended to do this season was “Fade Out—Fade In.” “I was a victim of a series of incidents,” he explains.“I had started‘Funny Girl’ a long time ago, when Anne Bancroft was supposed to play the lead. That was called off so all I had to do was “Fade Out—Fade In.” Then Carol got pregnant and it was postponed. “I was doing nothing when Leon Leonidoff came along with the World's Fair show, ‘Wonder World.’ A year before I had promised Betty Comden and Adolph Green to do the movie,‘What a Way to Go.’ Then Barbra Streisand was signed for ‘Funny Girl’ and within six weeks all these things got started. While I was writing ‘Funny Girl,’ Tony Richardson said Imust do the score for ‘Arturo Ui.’ He would write out all the cues, he said, and I was the only composer he wanted. So I found myself doing five things at once.” “Fade Out—Fade In,” for whichComden and Green have provided the lyrics, was actually written last season. But when Miss Burnett's pregnancy forced postponement and allowed time for reconsiderations, Styne found that half of his original score was no longer applicable. As a result, while “Funny Girl” was still going through its tryout paces he was simultaneously writing new material for “Fade Out” in which Miss Burnett plays a chorus girl whois discovered by a Hollywood producer in the 1930's. “It's a very different kind of show,” Styne said. “It's not the usual satire on Hollywood It's very high comedy. We show the end of Hollywood czarism and the emergence of the independents. And we take it lovingly.” Helpful Hint Styne's sense of urgency about his work for the theater is intensified by the fact that he does not consider 1947, when he wrote the music for “High Button Shoes,”ashis starting point. In his view, he did not really enter the theater until 1952 when he was coproducer ofa revival of Rodgers's and Hart's “Pal Joey.” Theman who opened the door for him was Richard Rodgers. Until then, Styne had approached the theater much as he had approached the 35 films for which he had written songs. “For the movies you write on one level all the time,” he explained. “There's only one level. Will the recording man like it? Will Sinatra likeit? For ‘High Button Shoes’I just wrotea lot of nice songs that had nothing to do with the show. Then in ‘Hazel Flagg’ I did everything to show how clever I was.I tried to be Dick Rodgers, Cole Porter, Kurt Weill—everybody.” Working with Rodgers on “Pal Joey,” Styne received a bit of clarifying advice. “Don’t be a minor Cole Porter,”Rodgers urged him. “Be yourself and the critics will gradually have respect for you.”

560-> Lord Brabazon of Tara Dies; First Briton to Fly in England; Aviator Had Also Been Early Auto Racer and Minister of Transport for Churchill
LONDON, May 17 — Lord Brabazon of Tara died tonight at his home in Chertsey, Surrey. He was 80 years old. He had entered a nursing home after suffering a heart attack on April 26 but had returned home this month. Lord Brabazon of Tara was the first Englishman to fly in his own country. In a long, formidable career, he was also a pioneer motorist, a yachtsman, champion bobsledder, golfer, singer, inventor and businessman. He also sat for many years in Parliament, was Minister of Transport and later Minister of Aircraft Production in Sir Winston Churchill's wartime Government. “Brab,” as his friends called him, was always known for his frankness. It was this quality that brought his governmental career to a close. In the spring of 1942, speaking to a private gathering, he was said to have expressed the hope that the German and Soviet armies would exterminate each other. Strong censure from the Labor party was brought against him, and he was obliged to resign. With characteristic calm, Lord Brabazon referred to this episode. briefly in his autobiography, “The Brabazon Story,” as “rather inglorious and very silly.” Still, it did not slow his activity. He was raised almost immediately to the peerage, as the first Baron Brabazon of Tara. Nor was his connection with aviation severed, for in 1943 when the Civil Aviation Committee on postwar transport was set up, Lord Brabazon was chosen to preside over it. It promptly became known popularly as the Brabazon committee, and among the new aircraft it proposed was the Bristol Brabazon, named in his honor, but destined never to achieve his distinction in the air. John Theodore Cuthbert Moore‐Brabazon was born on Feb. 8, 1884, the son of Lieut. Col. J. A. H. Moore‐Brabazon and the former Emma Sophia Richards. He was exposed to the best of educations at Harrow and at Trinity College, Cambridge, but through both institutions he tinkered with motors, acquiring at first a seven‐horsepower Panhard with two cylinders. After leaving college, he started racing in association with C. S. Rolls, who was to make a name of his own in automobiles, In his career as motorist, Lord Brabazon was to drive more than 200 makes of car and to become chairman of the Order of the Road. His biggest racing success was the winning of the Circuit des Arbennes in 1907 when, driving a Minerva under the Kaiserpreis formula, he came in ahead of Koolhoven by 27 seconds. On May 2, 1909, at Eastchurch, Lord Brabazon made the first flight ever to be accomplished by a Briton in his own country. The report of the flight was confirmed 20 years later by a special committee of the Royal Aero Club, against rival claims by two others. In 1910, Lord Brabazon received the first pilot's license issued by the club, and four years later he was serving in France with the Royal Flying Corps. He was responsible for the development of aerial photography during the war, was awarded the Military Cross, and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. After the war Lord Brabazon was elected to the House of Commons as Conservative member for the Chatham division of Rochester. Before he was turned out of Parliament in the Labor landslide in 1929, he had served on the first Civil Aviation Committee, had been chairman of the Air Mails Committee and twice served as parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Transport. In May, 1940, Lord Brabazon was appointed Minister of Transport, and brought in a great many innovations to alleviate wartime problems and the traffic dangers caused by blackouts. In May, 1941, he succeeded Lord Beaverbrook as Minister of Aircraft production until he was obliged to resign because of the remark about the German and Soviet armies. Lord Brabazon was a sturdy, slow‐moving man, and deceptively indolent‐looking to anyone who might not have seen him in action. The speeds and hazards of bobsledding appealed to him even when he was 70. He was a familiar figure on the Cresta run at St. Moritz and won the Curzon Cup in 1920, 1922 and 1927.

562-> WAGNER ASSAILS BILLS ON PENSIONS; Accuses State of Violating Home‐Rule Guarantee
Mayor Wagner accused the Legislature last night of staging a “raid on the treasury” in passing pension bills, largely on its own initiative, that would cost the city more than $25 million a year. He called the Legislature's action “a violation of home rule and all concepts of fiscal integrity.” The 14fayor said that the city had filed objections to 11 of 15 pension bills that have been approved or are in the process of being passed. The Legislature is putting these measures through as amendments to the General Municipal Law, thus bypassing the home‐rule guarantees in the State Constitution. The city has not been consulted on the bills, and neither the City Council nor the Mayor has made a home‐rule request for ”passage of the legislation. The Mayor's statement was mild compared to the reaction of leading civic groups in the city after the disclosure of the cumulative impact of the individual pension bills the Legislature has been passing piecemeal. “Indefensib{e and inekcusable!” declared Harold Riegel= man, counsel to the Citizens Budget Commission. “Outrageous,” said ”I.” D. Robjbins, president of the City Club. ' “DepIorable,” said Milton Ber”german, chairman of the Citi””zens” Union.” “An appalling action,” ”said ”Mrs. Helen West, president of” the Women's City Club. The Citizens Budget Commission and the City Club, each acting separately, are contemplating ”suits challenging the” ”constitutionality of the laws.” The board of t:ie Citizens Union will meet tomorrow night to determine the “most effective steps that can be taken to block these measures.” The civic groups also will ask Governor Rockefeller to veto the bills. The civic groups agreed, generally, ”that” unions representing the police, firemen, sanitation workers and others in city government, who first obtained bargaining rights under the Wagner administration, should properly state their case for better pensions in negotiations. Mr. Riegelman called the Legislature's action “a blatant example of irresponsibility at the instance of an ingenious and ruthless small group of civil service leaders.” Wagner Touches Issue ”Mayor .Wagner also” touched on this issue in his ”statement.” ”“Some of these groups of em””ployes may well have a” good case and a good claim,” ”tle” said, ”but their proper route is through the city, w;tere their claims ”can be weighed,”:”against,” ”and reconciled with; `those of” other groups oP etYiployes and other demands for city funds. “These changes ”should not be” mandated ”by” a ”Legislature” ”which denies us our legitimate” share of state aid, but is quite generous in imposing costs upon us.” At Albany, Democratic leaders in the Legislature acknowledged that .a number of ”pen””sion” bills to which' the Mayor objected had been passed with only slight protest from their minority forces. But the leaders said they were helpless. Both Senate Minority Lcader Joseph 2aretzki, Democrat of Manhattan, and Assembly Minority ”Leader Anthony J. Travia,” ”Democrat of Brooklyn, admitted” ”that the pension bills had been” politically embarrassing to them. ”“We were caught in a” squeeze,” said Mr. Zaretzki, “W e; could hardly vote‘no' on these' ”bills and then let the Republi””cans” pass them over ”our” objections. No one with any political savvy could do that. ”I” ”think this was done deliberate””ly” to embarrass us.” Cites Political Pressures ”Mr. . Travia frankly admitted” he could not ”control his party's” ”votes in the lower house be””cause of the” political pressures ”on the Assemblymen. The Uni””formed Firemen's Association,” the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association and various teacher organizations have powerful lobbies that speak for big voting blocs. One ”New Y ork City Demo””crat” privately conceded he had gone along tvith the pension bills; but with misgivings. He said he woitild have•voted against them “if the minority leadership had taken a strong ”stand.”” ”In the” Legislature, which is now driving for adjournment, accounts varied on the number of ”these bills that have passed” ”both houses and are now before” the Governor. One Albany source reported that four bills ”had been passed”, that would cost the city $14,685' million a year. But the Mayor's office listed seven such bills last night, which would cost the ,city $17.675 million. The city, however, is backing 'one of these bills, which would give the Transit Authority po1`ce the same pension rights as the regular police. The city is also backing two other bills that woula extend the same pension ”rights to” correction officers and Housing ”Authority policemen.” ”Co9ti Put at $6.1 Million ”:These” three ”bills would cost” ”the City $6.1” million a year. The ”city; has””,””hot taken a stana on” ”a;.fourth bill,” which would perinit sanitation workers to retire at' half of their last year's pay after' 25 years of service. :, Ob ject;ons have been filed by the•tity; however, to all the othei•bills, including the followinb;:'which the city lists as passed: qTwo bills that would eliniinate ”the” “”death gamble”” ”in the” ”pensions of” policemen and firemen. ”The bills specify that” ”when. a fireman or policeman” ”dies, he is” considered as having retired at the best available option. The annual cost would be $4.75 . million ”for the police'” and $2.475 million for the fira men. A bill permittIng teachers to retire when they are 55 years old after 25 years of service instead of the present 30 ”years. Cost: $4.7 million annually. A bill on pension for sanita.tionnien. Cost: $2.35 million annually. A bill that would change the method of computing police service beyond 20 years of servtrP_ Cest: S1.6 million a vear.l A bill permitting judges of lower courts to retire on the, same conditions as Supreme Court justices. Cost: undeter‐I mined. ”OE the other bills, all are re”ported out of committee and on” ”the” ' ”calendar of either the As””sembly or the Senate. The an””nual cost on all except one is” ”below $1 million a year. The” ”exception is”, ”a bill reopening” ”teachers”' ”options for higher con””tributions and higher pensions.” ”The estimated cost of this bill” ”is $2.76 million annually.”

563-> MAX ASH DEAD AT 76; DRESS INDUSTRY AIDE
MOUNT VERNON, N. Y., April 27—Max Ash, a retired New York dress industry executive, died today in Mount Vernon Hospital at the age of 76. He lived at 155 Crary Avenue. Born in Austria, Mr. Ash was brought to the United States as a child. He was graduated in 1913 from Cooper Union, New York, as a civil engineer. He was associated with several concerns in New York as an engineer, including one for which he worked on construction of part of the city's subway system. He entered the dress industry in the nineteen‐twenties. At one time he was a partner with Jo Copeland, the designer, in a dress manufacturing company bearing her name. Mr. Ash was also a former production manager of Christian Dior‐New York, Inc., dress manufacturers, and vice president and production manager in charge of quality control of Handmacher Vogel, Inc., manufacturers of women's suits and coats. He also was employed as a production manager of Maurice Rentner, Ltd., dress manufacturers, and after working for other concerns he returned to Rentner as a consultant. He retired from Rentner about two years ago. Surviving are his widow, Mrs. Sylvia Moreinis Ash; a son, Dr. Arthur S. Ash, a dentist; two daughters, Mrs. Benjamin Miller and Mrs. Hildreth Strode, and six grandchildren.

564-> ERHARD CRITICIZED ON RESTITUTION LAG
BERLIN, May 27—Leaders of the Bundestag accused the Federal Govermnent of Chancel‑lor Ludwig Erhard today of em‐ “fiscal ploying agruments” in refusing to extend restitution payments to more than 100,000 victims of the Nazis. Mr. Hirsch and Prof. Franz Boehm, the Christian Democratic co‐chairmen, supported the demands of organizations seeking to obtain indemnification for victims who left Eastern Europe after Oct. 1, 1953. Payments under restitution law are made at present only to persons who were in the West by that time. Professor Boehm said that 100,000 to 150,000 Victims of the Nazis, mainly Jews, had been able to make their way to the West from their Eastern European homelands since then.

566-> LOUIS DAVIDSON, 69, LAWYER AND WRITER
Louis B. Davidson, a retired lawyer and writer of sea stories, died on Friday in his home. He was 69 years old. Mr. Davidson, who received a degree from New York University Law School, founded the firm of Davidson & Davidson with his brother, the late Joseph E. Davidson, in 1921. He retired about a year ago. After many years of studying and collecting tales of the sea, Mr. Davidson collaborated in 1952 with Eddie Doherty to write “Captain Marooner,” a fictionalized account of the ill‐starred voyage of the whaler Globe out of Nantucket in 1822. Two years later, again with Mr. Doherty, a freelance writer, he wrote an anthology called “Strange Crimes at Sea.” Mr. Davidson's preoccupation with nautical matters extended beyond writing. In 1933, he presented an award to Capt. Robert R. Willmott for his “heroic seamanship” in guiding the hurricane‐tossed Morro Castle safely to port. The award, a gold watch and chain, was given by passengers of the liner. Louis D. Jaeger of 15 Ash Street, Floral Park, L. I., a retired jeweler, died Friday in Jamaica Hospital in Queens. He was 69 years old. A past president of the Queens Village Rotary Club and a veteran of World War I, he also was a past secretary of the Parent Assembly of the Society of American Magicians. He owned many books on magic.

567-> ERHARD PLEDGES PEACE WITH EAST; Remarks Seen as Reaction to Johnson Suggestion
BERLIN, May 1—Chancellor Ludwig Erhard told a large May Day rally in West BerIin today that the East German Government was seeking to achieve “permanent, just and peaceful settlements” with the Soviet Union and the other East bloc countries. West Germany “is aware of the legitimate security interests of our Eastern neighbors, in view of the Nazi horrors of the past,” he said, “but I want to repeat once more that we seek understanding and friendly relations with all countries on a basis of mutual respect.” Dr. Erhard's remarks were seen as a reaction to President Johnson's recent public suggestion that West Germany should strive for better relations with the Soviet Union. The President mde the suggestion in an interview with the West German magazine Quick. The Chancellor rejected any ideas of political talks with the East German Communists. He said: “The officials of East Germany cannot be our partners in negotiations. They operate as puppets under the Soviet military power.” As Dr. Erhard was addressing about 300,000 Berliners in their Sunday best on the Square of the Republic, near the wall erected by the Communists, the East Germans staged a military parade half a mile away to the east of the wall. Units of the armed forces paraded past Walter Ulbricht, the Communist leader, to the tunes of Prussian marches. Heavy artillery, antiaircraft and antitank rockets, Sovietmade tanks of the T‐54 model and other heavy equipment were displayed in a 35‐minute show of military power. This year's speeches and slogans were carefully worded to avoid any threat to West Berlin. Alfred Neumann, a politburo member, who was the main speaker, emphasized East Germany's willingness “to do everything possible to contribute towards reaching a detente and an understanding between the two German states and within the world.”

N time to turn attention to other things, such as conventions; Dwight D. Eisenhower has finished dictating his report on “The White House Years.” The first volume had the subtitle of “Mandate for Change,” the second is known only as “Volume Two,” until a better term can be found. Checking of the manuscript now is going forward in President Eisenhower's office at Gettysburg, and publication should be early in the new year. Incidentally, the author's son, John, who retired from the Army to be a Doubleday editor, apparently is to be a one‐book editor. When his father's book is delivered to the publisher, he will tip his hat to Publishers’ Row and will Join the staff of the Freedom Foundation. As in the case of Ruth and Naomi, and whither thou goest I will go, authors quite often follow their editors. A case in point is the long‐time association of MacKinlay Kantor and Donald Friede. At the time of Kantor's “Andersonville,” Mr. Friede was with World, which published same. Afte leaving World and putting in interim time with Prentice‐Hall, Mr. Friede now is with Doubleday. That firm will publish Mr. Kantor's next book, a biography of Gen. Curtis E. LeMay, Chief of Staff of the Air Force. It should come out in the autumn of ’65. George Waller, who wrote “Kidnap: The Story of the Lindbergh Case” in 1961, is at work on a history of the financial crash of 1929. There will be eye‐witness accounts from hundreds of people who have no trouble recalling it as though it were yesterday, all set down minute ‐ by ‐ minute. Random House will offer this to a shudder in 1966. OMORROW night, over WNEW‐TV Channel 5, there will be a program on “My Childhood.” one of the participants being James Baldwin. In the course of putting this together, Mr. Baldwin discussed his use of libraries—“I finally read myself out of Harlem”—and afterward he was asked what were the books he best remembered. Here is the list: “Uncle Tom's Cabin,” “A Tale of Two Cities” (“I read the first over and over before moving on to Dickens”); “Crime and Punishment,” “The Possessed,” “The Brothers Karamazov,” by Dostoevsky; “The Portrait of a Lady” and The Princess Casamassima,” by Henry James; “Invisible Man,” by Ralph Ellison; “Black Boy,” by Richard Wright. As a sort of postscript, and no longer a kid in Harlem, he said he now would add—as a good book—“The Messenger,” by Charles Wright. This is a first novel by a young Negro writer, was published last year by Farrar, Straus, among other characters has the shadowy loiterers of Forty‐second Street. At the moment, Mr. Baldwin is the country's most talked‐of literary figure, talked‐of also meaning talked at. Avoiding the telephone, he is hidden away out‐of‐town, producing the word that will go with the photographs of Richaid AVedon to form a book called “An Essay.” For Atheneum in the fall, it is “a study of Americans and how we live,” said Mr. Baldwin, going back to work. N the … And Bear in Mind listing this morning is a novel, “The Death of Artemio Cruz,” by Carlos Fuentes, the Mexican writer. It is his third book published in this country, and leafing casually through reviews of all three can be a somewhat unsettling experience. Mr. Fuentes has been called everything from a grubby beatnik to a propagandist for the Roman Catholic Church. The State Department has still another opinion of him, although private and not understood by Mr. Fuentes, for it allowed him only a five‐day visa to visit. What he seems, in conversation over a small fraction of the five days, is an amiable man of 35, the son of the Mexican Ambassador to Italy, one who himself was in Mexico's foreign service before becoming a novelist. Besides the three books translated here, there were a book of short stories—“very young, and let's forget them”—and a novella published in Mexico. He concedes the influence of Dos Passos on his work, and of all things—or maybe it isn’t of all things—Orson Welles's “Citizen Kane,” the seeing of which he remembers as a highlight of a New York visit, aged 11. The background of revolution and turmoil. in “The Death of Artemio Cruz” came from family stories and “dark memory” rather than history books, and the background of the novel on which he now is working—“Night Sun”—comes from travels, in Mexico, South America, Greece. Along with the novel, he is wOrking on a Dook of stories and one of essays, the subjects Of the latter ranging from history to Shakespeare. He is a deeply admiring student of Shakespeare. UTHOR of an excellent book of some months back, “The Quiet Crisis,” Stewart L. Udall was in town on behalf of “America the Beantiful,” one of the books about President Kennedy whiCh he had “a minor role” in putting together. Mr. Udall has plans for two further books, also two barriers between himself and the typewriter. One is that as Seeretary of the Interior he has a full‐time, nonliterary job. The other is that as the parent of a cluster of small boys he is running into the summer‐camping season. As to the books — the next probably will be a sort of sequel to “The Quiet Crisis,” outlining a conservation program involving buildings and places as well as rivers and trees. “Sitting where I do,” he said, “I get a good many suggestions about conservation.” The second book would be about conservation.” The second book would be about the American Indian, the diversity of culture from tribe to tribe, etc. Where the writing part of the Udall time takes over from Interior is early in the morning, late at night—and on airplanes. There is plenty of time “to reflect” on airplanes, including the hour and a half his plane circled New York bringing him here, as the pilot sought a hole in the fog.

569-> ERHARD
BONN, May 21 — Chancellor Ludwig Erhard promised today new Government measures to maintain a stable economy in West Germany in the midst of its inflation‐wracked European neighbors. “We shall do everything necessary to get out of the inflationary trend,” the Chan‐cellor said in a speech at an international handicraft fair in Munich. He offered no indication of what further stabilization meas‐ ures he had in mind. Last week the Government announced its intention to make substantial cuts on July 1 in West German tariffs on in‐ dustrial goods. Parliament is considering a tax bill aimed at stemming the flow from abroad of “hot” money—that is, money seeking the highest possible in‐terest rate. Dr. Erhard has been sound‐in the alarm against the dan‐ger of “imported inflation” from neighboring countries where prices have been rising steeply. Flight capital has been enter‐ing West Germany and exports of relatively , cheap German goods have soared. In the first four months of this year, West Germany showed a trade surplus of nearly $800 million as against $300 million in the first third of 1963. Ex‐ ports were up 19 per cent. In his speech today, Dr. Er‐hard called the contradictory economic trends in West Ger‐ many and its Common‐Market partners “an alarming sign.“ The Chancellor made no ref‑ erence in his speech to yester‐ day's “reconciliation“ meeting at which he sought to restore unity within his feuding Chris‑ tian Democratic party on for‐eign policy. It is officially said that a united position on the funda‐mentals of West German policy was achieved in his discussions with Foreign Minister Gerhard Schröder and former Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss. The two are leaders, respective‐ly, of a “flexible” and a “hard” foreign policy line in Christian Democratic party councils. Spokesmen for the two groups agreed that unity had been restored, each at the same time seeking to give the im‐pression that his man had pre‐vailed. A source close to Mr. Strauss said the Chancellor had been “visibly impressed” by the Ba‐varian leader's exposition of his views. Another official, speaking for Dr. Schröder, said the Foreign Minister was pleased that “the position of the Government had been strengthened.” He noted that other European authorities had finally taken up the West German Government's appeal for “moderation.” But the political will to take the obvious economic steps re‑ mained in short supply, the Chancellor said. Dr. Erhard warned that soli‐darity among the six Common‑ Market countries — West Ger‑ many, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxem‐ bourg — was not understood in Bonn to mean that “the sin‑ ners can count on the help of the others.” This was an allusion to ex‐pectations abroad that West Germany might revalue the Deutsche mark as a means of stemming the growing surplus in its balance of payments. The balance is the relationship be‐tween total payments to for‐eigners and receipts from them. Dr. Erhard has promised West German industry that the mark will not be revalued.

570-> IN AND OUT OF BOOKS
SINCE it is the country's publishing center, New York al‐ways has ahigh iacidence of visiting authors. Although largely a matter of coincidence, the days surrounding the opening of the World's Fair found the city outdoing its own record as host. Authors were here from Europe, from other parts of the country, from everywhere save tirough the floor following Manx cats. They came to consult publishers, to lecture, to meet the public, to act the hardsell salesmen for their books, this now being an integral part of authorship. Herewith some of them, with apologies to those not encountered before the strength of the legs gave out. UNDER another name, that of John Le Carré, Mr. Cornwell is the year's hottest literary figure. His “The Spy Who Came in From the Cold” has been at the top of the bestseller list for weeks and weeks, and two earlier novels, “Call for the Dead” and “A Murder of Quality,” will be republished June 1 under the title of “The Incongruous Spy.” Visiting this country for the first time on a meet‐the‐people schedule, he seemed gently amused at the excitement. Standing about with a cocktail glass in hand isn't writing, but then “I stood around a lot in the foreign service, and am used to it” After the success of “The Spy” he left Britain's service, moved with his wife and three young boys to Crete. There he is about three months from the end of a new book, “The Looking Glass War.” One character in it is George Smiley, former espionage agent, who was in the two halves of “The Incongruous Spy,” as well as “The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.” While working for Britain, he wrote weekends and from 5 o'clock in the morning until 9 weekdays. Now he works from 5 until noon, and instead of attending Her Majesty's business in the afternoon, goes swimming. POET, lepidoptreist, author of books in both Russian and English, Mr. Nabokov remains wryly amused that his great popular reputation came about as author of “Lolita.” Now a resident of Switzerland, he was here for poetry readings in New York and Cambridge, Mass., and to consult the butterfly collection at the Museum of Natural History. Next book will be a verse translation of Pushkin's “Eugene Onegin,” to be published by the Bollingen Foundation in June. By June he'll be back in Switzerland, working on another book, pursuing Swiss butterflies. The work‐in‐progress he describes as “a little novel but tricky, very tricky,” the title a Nabokov secret, but the end in sight—to coincide with the end of this year. As to chasing Swiss butterflies through the Swiss Alps, age 65—“Oh, Iwas a good soccer player and still can walk 20 miles a day. It's fun to go from one level to another; up to the timber line. They're common, butterflies; of course, but give a good excuse for walking.” ALABAMA is Mr. Huie's home, and his current book, just published, is “The Hiroshima Pilot.” This concerns Maj. Claude Eatherly, who piloted one of the planes accompanying the Enola Gay to Hiroshima. About Major Eatherly and his subsequent actions and difficuities with the law there has been international controversy and two points of view. One is that he blamed himself for the Hiroshima slaughter. The other is that he felt he did not get his share of credit in the publicity following Hiroshima. Mr. Huie began with belief in the first, ended with the second. “I worked on this one for two years, chasing down clues, looking up records, talking to Eatherly, at times hiring four people to help me—the sort of thing on which you spend $30,000 and at the end you wish you'd never heard of him.” Mr. Huie now is working on a novel, “In the Hours of Night,” its leading character a figure not unlike James Forrestal, late Secretary of Defense. LAST autumn, M. Berger, a young French writer, won a certain renown through “The Garden,” a novel set in the 18thcentury American South, a locale the author never had visited, even in the 20th century. Just after the publication of “The Garden,” he came here to see the South, had plans for further novels about same. Over here this time as lecturer and on business for his French publisher, he said he is most of the way through a new story—but one lying outside the scheme he had planned for the South. The title, location? M. Berger shrugged affably. He doesn't like to talk about such things until they all are down on paper. There is an article by M. Berger today on page 28. He followed it to town closely enough that he was here to read proof. WINNING an excellent review in these pages a week ago was Mr. Leslie's “Dallas Public and Private,” a study far from favorable of the customs and refinements of that Texas city. As the result of the book, Mr. Leslie finds himself jobless and, to all intents and purpose, homeless — although both these were his own doing and can't be blamed on Dallas. Last November, as sales‐promotion manager for Neiman‐Marcus, Mr. Leslie had a fulltime job, was spending his evenings in writing a leisurely bookon Texas. Due to the events of Nov. 22, he decided a book on Dallas was in order, resigned his job so as to avoid employer embarrassment, put some of the research for Texas into “Dallas,” went on and finished. A native New Yorker, the author thinks he now may return here to live, although anxious not to be “accused of writing and running.” At any event, he is 100 pages along in a novel about an Irish‐Catholic family living in New York. THE one visitor arriving with an eye on the World's Fair, Mr. Stone did so through proprietary interest in the Pietà, attained through his biography of Michelangelo, “The Agony and the Ecstasy,” plus a recently published little book, “The Story of Michelangelo's Pieta.” From New York he headed to Rome to watch the start of the filming of “The Agony,” then will return to California and work‐in‐progress. This is a book on Abigail Adams, wife and mother of Presidents, Mr. Stone thus far having completed five of nine chapters. All of the research is finished; he thinks the book will be finished in time for a September publication, 1965. Incidentally, Sept. 26 of this year marks the 30th anniversary of “Lust For Life,” the • fictionalized biography of Van Gogh which started Mr. Stone's book career. No celebration dinner with Mrs. Stone, who is editor‐in‐residence on all Stone books. VER from Paris, to lecture and to learn, M. Sperber has two literary projects. One is a trilogy of previously published novels to be summed up as “A Tear in the Sea.” The second is a collection of essays, “Revisiting.” These will be personal notes about some countries he knows well, others—Greece, Israel, the United States—he visited first only in imagination, then in reality.

571-> ENGLISH ‘PROM’ MAESTRO FOR NEW YORK PROMENADES
LONDON. IT is difficult to believe that the Englishman who will help tne New York Philharmonic give its second season of “Promenade” concerts celebrated his 69th birthday a few days ago. The tall, dapper figure, smartiy dressed in a style redolent of natty Edwardiana, is that of a man at least twenty years younger. The gray in the neatly brushed‐back hair is very discreet; the carnation in the button‐hole is still worn with clan. Of the three senior English conductors of any stature, Barbirolli, Boult and Sargent, it is Sir Malcolm Sargent who has most successfully projected himself as a personality. Not necessarily as a musical personality (Barbirolli imposes a more intensely personal vision on the music he conducts, and Boult brings a more deliberate sympathy to certain composers), but as a showman in the best sense of the word. His own slickly professional approach to conducting is by no means to be despised: it can, after all, produce extremely competent performances of a wide variety of styles and periods in music. Sargent began his career as a church organist. At that time he was also engaged in composing music, and it was when he conducted one of his own works, “Impressions of a Windy Day,” at a Promenade Concert in the Queen's Hall, London, in 1921, that his special gifts as a conductor became evident. Since then he has conducted opera, symphony concerts, Gilbert and Sullivan and huge choral works. He has never favored one composer at the expense of another, though his favorite period appears to be the nineteenth century. He may appear not to possess any special insights where the standard repertory is concerned, unlike Klemperer with Beethoven, Böhm with Strauss or Karajan with Wagner; nevertheless, his performances are always intelligent and carefully prepared. If he exerts his personal magnetism more easily upon the young audiences he brings into London's Albert Hall nowadays than on his orchestral musicians who refer to him with more affection than awe as “Flash Harry,” that is no ereat matter at the Proms. But there is one respect in which Sargent transcends this image of himself, and that is as a choral conductor. Admittedly, even here one has to hedge, since his famous interpretation of Handel's “Messiah” continues to owe nothing to twentieth‐century Handel scholarship. While other conductors avail themselves now of the opportunity to conduct “Messiah” more or less as Handel intended it to be played, Sir Malcolm's reading is still grounded in the grandiose English choral tradition of the nineteenth century and the Crystal Palace concerts. He is never likely to conduct “Messiah” with 40 singers: 400 are too few for him. But if his Handel is noted more for its massive sound than for its clarity of detail, he really comes into his own in such works as Mendelssohn's “Elijah,” Elgar's “Dream of Gerontius” or Walton's “Belshazzar's Feast,” of which he gave the first performance at the Leeds Festival in 1931. Though Sargent is at his best when dealing with huge choral forces, a fact to which the continued success of his concerts with the Royal Choral Society attests, he also has a decided penchant for the Savoy Opera of Gilbert and Sullivan, and has delighted in introducing concert versions of them into the programs of his Promenade concerts. For eight weeks in the summer every year, Sir Malcolm still assumes chief control of the London “Proms.” It is here that he does what is probably his most valuable work. Each year, a young audience is given the opportunity to hear, as well as several novelties and rarities, almost the entire basic concert repertory: the most popular Mozart symphonies, all the Beethoven and Brahms symphonies, the popular romantic masterpieces, concertos, tone‐poems and overtures. Sargent's devotion to this yearly task is indefatigable, and his enthusiasm and enjoyment are infectious. He does not now concern himself very greatly with contemporary music, nor did he perform much of it even in his younger days, with the exception of the English symphonists Elgar and Vaughan Williams. And it is, perhaps, a pity that a musician with a receptive audience eager to learn from him should, by his neglect of the music of his own century, leave them with the inference that he doesn't think it worth playing. But this is not a point that ought to be too neavily stressea. One hears a great deal about the musician's responsibilities, but his pleasures ought to be considered as well. A conductor will play best that music he enjoys and loves, not that which he is persuaded it is his duty to perform. The one living composer whose works do appear on Sargent's programs is Shostakovich, several of whose symphonies he conducts admirably.

573-> New Baker Kickback Data May Spur Demands to Call White House Aide
WASHINGTON, March 10—As a result of new information received today by the Senate Rules Committee, Republican members were expected to intensify their demand that a White House aide be called to testify in the Robert G. Baker case. The information consisted of affidavits by Don B. Reynolds, a Maryland insurance man. It purported to show that WaIter Jenkins, the White House aide, and Mr. Baker sought to persuade him last year to rebate part of his commission on the conversion of a $100,000 insurance policy on the life of then Vice President Johnson. In previous testimony Mr. Reynolds told of another alleged insurance kickback whereby, at Mr. Jenkins's urging, he had invested $1,208 in advertising time on a Texas television station owned by the Johnson family. Mr. Jenkins has submitted a sworn statement to the committee denying knowledge of that transaction. He was an aide to Mr. Johnson when the latter was a Senator. This conflict of testimony has brought repeated requests from the Republican members of the committee that Mr. Jenkins be called to testify in person. The chairman, Senator B. Everett Jordan, Democrat of North Carolina, has said he sees no need to question Mr. Jenkins further. In his affidavits, Mr. Reynold said that in February, 1963, he was vacationing with his family at Montego Bay, Jamaica. On the 20th, he said, he received a call from Mr. Baker, who was in Washington, “to advise me that the Vice President, Lyndon B. Johnson, desired to know the amount of rebate, or kickback of commission, he would receive from his life insurance conversion of $100,000 term to $100,000 permanent, retroactively to date of issuance of term.” Mr. Reynolds had sold a $100,000 policy to Mr. Johnson in 1957, and another in that amount in 1961, after he had become Vice President. The second policy was a socalled term policy, which is renewable on a yearly basis, and is less costly in premiums than a regular or permanent policy. In a conversion from term to permanent, most insurance cornpanes grant a rebate on the premium differential, but only for a six‐month period before conversion. Mr. Reynolds said he did not give Mr. Baker an immediate reply, telling him he would look into the matter when he eturned. On his return home,’ he said, he received other calls from Mr. Baker and also from Mr. Jenkins. In a phone conversation in late April or May of last year, he said, Mr. Jenkins asked him “if I had received my commission [on the conversion], and I stated I had; he then stated that whatever I had worked out with Mr. Baker should be given to Mr. Baker in cash, and Mr. Baker would bring it in.” The insurance man also submitted an affidavit from a woman who operates a telephone answering service to which he subscribes, in which the dates of certain calls allegedly from Mr. Jenkins were given. Mr. Reynolds told a reporter that the sum involved in the proposed rebate was about $750. However, he said, the rebate was never paid to Mr. Baker or Mr. Jenkins. The committee heard another former Senate aide, Scott I. Peek, in executive session today. It sought to question Jack B. Cooper of Miami, but he invoked the Fifth Amendment against self‐incrimination in refusing to answer. Mr. Peek, former administrative assistant to Senator George A. Smathers, Democrat of Florida, is now a Florida businessman. He has been mentioned frequently in testimony by other witnesses as a close friend of Mr. Baker and a participant with him in several business ventures. Mr. Baker resigned under fire as secretary of the Senate Democratic majority. His outside business activities have been under investigation almost five months. At the end of the session the committee voted to make Mr. Peek's testimony public tomorrow. However, Lennox P. McLendon, the chief counsel, gave reporters an informal briefing on the highlights of today's testimony. In what appeared to have been his most striking disclosure, Mr. Peek was quoted as having said that he gave Mr. Baker his ‐ check‐ for $2,875 in 1959 to buy stock in the phenomenally profitable Mortgage Guarantee Insurance Company. He said the stock was issued in Mr. Baker's name. When, a few years later, he asked to have it transferred to his own name, he said, Mr. Baker told him that could not be done, since he had pledged it as collateral for a loan that he, Mr. Baker, had made at the Fidelity National Bank and Trust Com of Oklahoma City. Mr. Peck told the committee that Mr. Baker gave him a $5,000 check in 1962 and another in that amount in 1963 as loans for the continued use of his stock. Mr. McLendon said the witness had described several other enterprises in which he had joined Mr. Baker, and also one in which Senator Smathers had been a participant. Mr. Peek told the committee he had estimated his profits ,from these at $30,000 to $40,000. !after allowing for repayment of ;the $10,000 loan from Mr. Baker. Mr. Cooper, stockily built and baldish, had been sought by Federal marshals for. several weeks in an attempt to serve him with the committee's subpoena He appeared with his attorney, E. David Rosen, in open session. He has been convicted for income‐tax evasion, but the case is on appeal. He has been mentioned in previous testimony as an original incorporator of Serv‐U, the vending machine company that is one of the foundations of Mr. Baker's financial edifice.

576-> HEADACHES AND TRANQUILIZERS
SOMETIMES an exhibition cuts away all the convenient points of refererence that help you get things in perspective. These are the ones that really make you work hard, and coping with Wiliam T. Wiley's show at the Staempfli Gallery, 4 E. 77th Street, is a kind of hard labor. Right away let me offer a conclusion and then arrive at it — Wiley is a disturbingly brilliant artist, going somewhere by means as convoluted as an intestinal tract, which is what some of his paintings remind you of. His surrealism—to grab an easy label—provokes a psychological curiosity immediately frustrated since he gives you enough to speculate on, but not enough to form conclusions. Everything remains open, alienated, keeping you mentally off‐balance. This effect was also produced by two shows recently at the Nordness Gallery, David Oxtoby's and John Lennard's, both of whom Seem to have evolved a laconic post‐Pop style by crossing it with Surrealism, a difficult hybrid to deal with. Wiley, now 27, is a young prodigy. I saw a show of his in San Francisco in 1961 that was,a breath‐taking display of muscle, and ever since have been waiting for him to arrive here. Last December he did what looks (from the photographs) a wildly pungent decor and costumes for Jarry's “Ubu Roi”. His theme seems to be a neurological exploration of mind ‐ body relationships through circuits and symbols charged with obsession. The pyramid (in boxes, paintings, drawings) dominates his work, invaded by tubers with hairy ends, and frequently bearing, bi‐lobed attachments—like an image of conjoint ego and id. This motif appears and disappears throughout his work, surrounded by interrupted lines stammering along, by islands that encyst themselves, by repetitive linear annotations that have some of the virtuosity of Mary Bauermeister's magic writing. By juggling all these in an odd dimension created by repiti‐ tion and interruption,he achieves an effect like that of teasing out strategic brain cells with a series of needles, constantly jerking us into reflex thought. The large paintings are generally not successful, muffling, instead of monumentalising, small interior insights. The best of them, “Columbus Rerouted No. 3” uses a stunning variety of technical means to sustain a variety of forms and colors in an alienated limbo where the processes of thought are symbolically transposed into the processes that make up outside events. Wiley is a force. After this complexity, two Pop shows appear to materialise in a pure vacuum. One was a disappointment, the other a happy surprise. Wayne Thiebaud at the Allen Stone Gallery, 48 East 86th Street, is a pre‐Pop master who has already contributed to the iconography of Mass Man by his brilliant windows on the infinite—the infinite made up of endless desserts of commercial foods. Now he has got to the consumer. Mass Man and Woman sit on high stools eating frankfurters, ice‐cream, sit on benches, lie down, are stripped to the skin, They are painted with a bright aggressiveness that is a refined version of poster‐painting. Apart from some good stilllifes, painted less deliquescently than before, he seems to have lost his. way between a desire to paint and a desire to not‐paint a Gertrude Steinish dilemma that confronts any pure,Pop‐man who threatens his work with transformation instead of entering it dead‐pan in the Pop Stakes. There, sticking as close to its temporal point of origin as a stamp to a letter, it can be posted into the future where it may survive as art depending on its basic competence and the resuscitating power of nostalgia. Rosalyn Drexler's paintings at the Kornblee Gallery, 58 East 79th Street, may well survive on this basis, and even do a little better than that. Her work looks like “The Late Show” caught in the new abstraction—the cliche poses of love and violence, hallowed in Hollywood iconography, are enlarged from posters and, captionless, are separated into episodes, like a Tercento painting, This is a lot better than it sounds, and with her blankly summary presentations, of melodrama, Miss Drexler, who has a Pop play called “Home Movies” going for her down at the Judson Memorial Church tonight and tomorrow, has arrived.

577-> LOUISIANA EXHIBIT IN FISCAL TROUBLE: Failure to Pay $1.5 Million Debt Squeezes Company
The failure of the Louisiana Pavilion to pay most of its $2 million construction bill at the World's Fair resulted yesterday in the filling of a bankruptcy petition in Federal Court by an air‐conditioning corporation. The company, Billen Aircon‐conditioning, Inc of 244 Mercer Street, is headed by William Eden, who is also president of the Louisiana Fair Corporation, operators of the pavilion. The petition,under chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, seeks an arrangement under which the company can pay its creditors while it continues to operate. The Louisana pavillion is open in part but has not yet been completed, Mr.Eden said. Billen, which has four sub‐sidiaries and is in the business of installing air‐conditioning equipment in large industrial plants, listed total assets of $623,953 and total liablities of $475,972. The papers said Billen was a member of a joint venture known as K.B.M.Associates which undertook construction of the Louisiana Pavilion at the fair. Billen has a sub‐contract with K.B.M. for air condition‐ing the pavilion for $225,000. William Eden, president of Billen, said his corporation had entered into a joint venture with Harry H.kapilow & son,Inc.,and the Missile .Construction Corporation. He said they un‐dertook the build the pavilion at a cost of more than $2 miil‐lion. Mr.Eden said that the Louisi‐ana Fair Corporation had been unable to meet the obligations imposed upon it by the agree‐ment with the result that K.B.M. Associates owed ap‐proxmately $1.5 million to sub‐contractors, which Louisiana Fair Corporation has failed and is unable to pay.” As a result, Mr.Eden said, he has suffered a “dislocation of his air‐conditioning busi‐ness. In another action in Federal Court, Colourpicture publish‐ers, Inc., of Boston, filed a $5 million damage suit against the fair four other corpora‐tions. Colourpicture said the Fair Corporation claimed the right to prevent Colourpicture from selling products containing picture post card reproductions and color transparencies of the fair.

582-> Wallace Asserts Popular Response Calls for a Serious Bidin Wisconsin
APPLETON, Wis., March 17 —Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama opened his campaign today in Wisconsin's Presidential preferential primary by declaring himself a “serious candidate.” He conceded he had entered the campaigns here and in Maryland as a symbolic protest against what he termed Federal encroachments on states' rights. But he said the popular response had changed this. “We're very serious about the matter,” he said. “We're going to run a serious campaign.” Mr. Wallace, a leading segregationist, is running as a Democrat, much to the expressed embarrassment of Gov. John Reynolds of Wisconsin, his only opponent, and other liberal leaders of the party. Mr. Reynolds is running as a favorite son in an attempt to block the election of a proWallace slate of delegates to the national convention. However, the Alabamian's tactics, position and reception by right‐wing conservatives were more reminiscent of the late Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Wisconsin Republican, who is buried here. Voters are free to cross party lines in the’April 7 primary. Several Republican leaders have said that many of the party's more conservative members will back Governor Wallace, partly to embarrass Democrats and also as a means of demonstrating support for pollcies advocated by Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona in his bid for the Republican Presidential nomination. The Governor arrived in an Alabama Highway Department plane yesterday at Milwaukee. He predicted that his support in the primary would “shake the left‐wing, pinko press” and leaders of both national parties. He flew today to this city in the eastern‐central Fox River Valley, once the political stronghold of Senator McCarthy In a news conference at the Conway Motor Hotel formally initiating his campaign, Mr. Wallace paid tribute to the man whose attacks on alleged Communists in government had contributed the word “McCarthyism.” “Senator McCarthy gave some good warnings in the days he was living about the leftwingism and Communism in this country,” he said. “Many of the things he seems to have been talking about seem to be coming to pass in this country.” These warnings, the Governor said, concerned “the left‐wing influence in the American Government and all this mobocracy around the world that's being led by either those who were in the Communist party or in a list of ‘front’organizations that long.” He spread his hands apart for emphasis. civil rights bill will destroy the He adopted a similar line of attack in a speech prepared for delivery to a luncheon meeting of the Rotary Club. His remarks implying that the civil rights movement was under Commu nist influence were deleted when he spoke, but were included in the version of the speech distributed later to newsmen. His “nonpolitical” address to the 200 Rotarians and their guests centered on an attack against the civil rights bill being debated in the Senate. At the news conference he declared that “the passage of this system of government in this country.” To the Rotarians, he said: “It is readily apparent that the loss of respect for the rights of private property will destroy the initiative and incentive of liberty and freedom‐loving people. “It is this damaging trend that we find shot through the Civil Rights Act of 1963. I state to you that this act is the forerunner of land reform in the United States.” Mr. Wallace contended that the measure threatened to elimnate trial by jury, union seniority rights, the right of business men to chose employes, local control of public education, freedom of thought and club privacy. Most of the luncheon audience gave him a standing ovation at the end of his speech. After a one‐block handshaking tour in bitter, 12‐degree weather, Mr. Wallace flew back to Milwaukee to meet with the slate of delegates pledged to his nomination.

585-> Larson, 75, Quits the Lobster Trick
FREEPORT, L.I. Harry Larson, 75‐year‐old dean of the Freeport lobstermen, no longer is too busy to attend the boat show. He has hauled in his pots for the last time. Wherever you roam in this Long Island fishing village, old salts chuckle when Larson's name is mentioned. “That shrewd little Swede always got the most and the best lobsters,” said one old‐timer recently. “He strung his pots outside the Cholera Bank. So did we, but he always came back with a bigger boatload. He never would tell us how he did it.” Now that he is retired, Larson thinks it is safe to disclose his secret. “I used to make my own cement blocks to hold down the pots,” Larson said, with an impish look. “But when I mixed the mortar I added clam juice to the water and tossed in some skimmer clam shells. Those blocks smelled so good and looked so much like the ocean bottom that the lobsters couldn't resist them. The aroma would disappear after a year and then I'd have to make new blocks.” Rocking‐chair retirement does not sit well with Larson, who has no living relatives. He used to bowl, averaging 194, but gave it up when he injured a knee. Now, when things get dull around Freeport, he hops on a train for Sayville, where he has some “Swedish cronies who are eelers.” In Sayville the conversation may vary from the quality of, the marzipan candy Larson loves to the stormy November night in 1937 when he was shipwrecked off Rockaway Point. “What a night that was!” he said. “Darkness overtook us while we were taking in our pots, so we tossed bow and stern anchors overboard. It wasn't too long before my two shipmates and I realized we were right in the ocean‐going steamship lanes. “I kept waving a flashlight, but when one big liner just missed us, we decided we'd better get the hell out of there. But the anchor ropes broke anyway, so we drifted in toward the beach. “About 500 feet offshore, a big breaker hit the boat and ohe of my partners was washed overboard. Somehow he made it to shore. My other partner and I hung on and rode our open boat right into a cement sea wall. What a mess that boat was! All of us spent the next three days in Rockaway Beach Hospital.” That wasn't Larson's first trip to a hospital. In 1906, he became ill on the North Sea while serving on a three‐masted sailing ship headed for Norway from England. “I had a terrible stomach ache, but nobody believed me, so I had to keep climbing the rigging,” he said. “During the day the captain gave me brandy to keep me going. “They finally got me to Gothenburg, my home in Sweden, where hot plates instead of ice bags were put on my stomach. I entered the hospital three weeks after I first became ill and the doctor said it was a miracle I was alive because I had had appendicitis for all that time.” During his five‐month stay in the hospital, Larson was ordered to stay off his feet. He complied by sneaking out of bed at night and walking around the hospital ward on his hands. In the following years his talented hands helped propel him to national prominence in Sweden as a wrestler. “I won the national light‐ weight championship at Malmoe in 1910,” he said. “At that time my weight was 67½ kilos. That's about 148 pounds. In 1914, 1915 and 1916 I won the Swedish title in the featherweight class. “My favorite grip was the Lindena, in which I would bend back and toss my opponent over my head whenever he put a bear hug on me. I got to the finals in the Olympics in Stockholm in 1912 before I had to quit because of bad mat burns on my legs and face.” Larson came to the United States in 1910, and with time out for the Olympics and a visit home in 1922, spent 20 years building bank vaults for the Mosler Safe Company. He started lobstering in 1934 and was extremely successful until 1955. “As long as the garbage boats were dumping offshore, there were plenty of lobsters,” he said. “But when the dumping stopped and boats began to drop acid out there, the lobsters disappeared. At that point I took up eeling.” At the peak of his lobster business, he had about 500 pots, with 35 on each string. “I never tried to get big lobsters because the best ones for broiling are from 1½ to 3 pounds,” he said. “Instead of pegging their claws, I used doubled‐up rubber bands. I quit fishing altogether. when I was 71.” Larson's hobby during his fishing career was training small animals. One of his cats, named Sonja for Sonja Henie, had sea legs that matched Larson's. “I taught Sonja to walk a tightrope with a rooster on her back,” said Larson. “Eventually she learned to step over another rooster perched on the rope without spilling the” rooster from her back. “Some young photographer heard about my cat and I let him take pictures. He won a prize of $1,500 for one of them in a national contest.” Larson's long bushy eyebrows arched and his weatherbeaten face became flushed as he recalled the incident. “Never got a dime out of It and never saw the guy again,” he said. “How do you like that?”

586-> Injunction Sought To Bar Settlement In Food‐Oil Case
A permanent injunction was sought yesterday against the American Express Company in an attempt to block the company's $55 million settlement offer to creditors of its warehousing subsidiary. The injunction was sought in State Supreme Court against the 18‐member board of American Express. Harold Barnett, an account executive of the brokerage house of Schweickart & Co. and the express company investor who brought the action, charged that the settlement would “constitute a waste of members’ assets.” Mr. Barnett, in filing his suit, became one more member of the small army of plaintiffs who have brought legal action in the wake of the food‐oil scandal that has lead some large concerns into bankruptcy. However, Mr. Barnett cited as his major legal point a decidedly distinctive feature of the American Express Company. Members Not Liable While the courts generally give wide latitude to corporate boards of directors to decide company policy, Mr. Barnett emphasized in his complaint that American Express was not a corporation, but “an unincorporated joint‐stock association.” As a result, he asserted that the company's 26,000 “shareholder‐members” do not have the status of a jural person, an entity recognized by the courts, and were therefore free from legal liability. In effect, Mr. Barnett maintained that the $55 million settlement offer, which was announced over the weekend by Howard L. Clark, president of American Express, was unnecessary. The creditors are pri’ marily several banks. The purpose of American Express in making the offer, as expressed by Mr. Clark, was to maintain the “good name” of the company and to do what it was “morally bound to do.” American Express Warehousing, Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Express Company, petitioned the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on Dec. 30, for an arrangement with creditors under the Bankruptcy Act. The subsidiary had done business with the now defunct Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Corporation since 1957. During the arrangement, warehouse receipts had been issued, some of which were later alleged to have been forgeries or statements on non‐existent commodities. As of Feb. 29, according to court papers, American Express had 4,333,479 shares outstanding of capital stock. The stock is traded on the over‐the counter market.

588-> NEW AUTOMOBILE TUNNEL PIERCES THE ALPS; ALPINE PASSAGE; Great St. Bernard Tube Linking Italy And Switzerland Open to Traffic
GENEVA—With the opening last week of the Great St. Bernard Road Tunnel, a new link was forged in the chain of events that have been drawing the nations of Western Europe closer together since the end of World War II. The 3.6‐mile boring through the towering Alpine barrier of rock, snow and ice that divides Europe cuts across the frontier between Switzerland and Italy. But it does more than join these two neighbors; it provides the first all‐weather vehicular passage through the Alps. This road, which follows the Seventh Meridian, is not a new one. It is a route used from the earliest times. Caesar sent his legions over the Great St. Bernard Pass, and Napoleon once marched an army of 40,000 men across it to surprise and defeat the Austrians at the ’ Battle of Marengo, Italy. In 1049, St. Bernard de Menthon founded, or refounded, the famous hospice that has remained through the centuries to become a major tourist attraction. It is situated at the summit of the 8,100‐foot pass. It was the great toll of Iives that the deadly, windswept pass was taking among the pilgrims, and the other travelers who braved it, that led to the founding of the hospice and the breeding of the St. Bernard dogs for rescue work. The move that was to make the tunnel a reality, at an estimated cost of $15 million, began in 1936, only to be blocked by World War II. It was not to take on momentum again until the founding, in 1947, of a Swiss committee for the tunnel. This was soon matched by a similar body in Italy. That motorists are now happily driving through the Great St. Bernard Tunnel a little more than five years after the first charge of dynamite was set off is a triumph for private enterprise. Unlike the nearby Mont Blanc Tunnel that will link France and Italy next year, the Great St. Bernard received no financial help from Governments. The Great St. Bernard will lose its title of the world's longest road tunnel when the Mont Blanc Tunnel of more than seven miles is opened to traffic. The shorter length of the Great St. Bernard tube is dwing in part to its greater altitude. The north, or Swiss, portal of the Great St. Bernard Tunnel is at an altitude of 5,350 feet, while the southern portal “in Italy is at 5,250 feet. The corresponding entrances to the Mont Blanc Tunnel are at altitudes of 4,180 feet and 4,350 feet. In addition to reducing the distance that had to be bored, the higher altitude of the Great St. Bernard Tunnel also simplified the delicate problem of assuring adequate ventilation. Two chimney‐like shafts were driven from inside the tunnel through the mountain above; one is used to evacuate the exhaust fumes and the other to provide fresh air. However, the tunnel's high altitude raised the problem of assuring its access to motorists during the winter months. It was solved by putting a concrete roof over the last few miles of the road, at both ends of the tunnel, so as to protect it from snow and avalanches. Motorists who approach the tunnel from the north go through Swiss and Italian police and Customs formalities and pay the toll collector before entering the tube. The toll ranges from the equivalent of $2.10 to $4.65, depending on the engine size of the car and the number of passengers. Likewise, those approaching the tunnel from the south will go through the same procedure at the Italian entrance. In this way, the motorist, once he enters the tunnel, is rid of all frontier formalities and is free to continue in the new country upon emerging from the tube. Near the tunnel's entrances, tourists can branch off the new road to the tortuous old one in order to drive over the pass during the months it is not snowbound. Many are expectedto do so because, as an official of the Swiss Regional Tourist Office said. “The pass will always be a powerful attraction of its own.” While driving through a tunnel to cross the Alps is a new experience for the tourist, he long has been able to ride his car, piggyback fashion, through one of the railroad tubes that have pierced the mountain chain since before the turn of the century.

591-> Heated Debates Over Pairing of 2 Schools Divide Queens
An area of Queens selected by the Board of Education as a testing ground for better school integration has turned into a battleground instead. The major battles are being fought in Jackson Heights, where a large segment of the predominantly white population has become aroused at the suggestion that Public School 149 be paired with P.S. 92 in predominantly Negro Corona. On a citywide levei demands for a much more extensive integration program than the Board of Education has yet proposed led to two school boycotts by civil rights groups. The Feb. 3 boycott kept 364,000 more students than usual out of school, and the one last Monday kept 168,000 out. On Feb. 12 10,000 to 15,000 persons demonstrated at City Hall and the board's headquarters against integration plans that they felt were inn extreme. In Queens, the debate has disrupted community meetings with organized handclapping and booing that has prevented speakers from being heard and with personal attacks exchanged by the opposing sides. At a meeting of the P.S. 149 Parents Association on Tuesday night a motion to “con demn” the Princeton Plan pro posal was adopted by, a vote of 221 to 58. One mother who favors the plan said with a sad shake of her head: “They've scared the moderates away. They don't want to expose themselves to the hate that's exnressed.” Although the present school district for 149 includes some students from Corona, the yellow traffic stripe down the center of Junction Boulevard is otherwise an effective divider between the two community “On three sides people don't know where Jackson Heights ends and another community begins,” one resident said, “but everyone knows the dividing line at Juncton Boulevard ” Separation Complete The separation has been sc complete that until the Princeton Plan was proposed, many persons in Jackson Heights were unaware that just six blocks from the well‐kept‐up P.S. 149, which is 87 per cent white, there is a rundown school that is 97 per cent Negro. The integration plan approved by the local school boards and the district superintendents calls for the assignment of all first and second‐grade pupils in the combined district to P.S. 92. A11 pupils in the third through sixth grades would go to P.S. 149, and children in kindergarten would attend the school nearest their homes. On paper the plan presents fewer difficulties than any other similar proposal in the city. The closeness of the two schools, for instance, would eliminate the need for trans porting by bus all but about 30 children in . the first two grades who would be more than half a mile from P.S. 92. But the battle is not being fought on paper. “I feel the plan ls difinitely an infringement upon my rights,” Mrs. Joan Addabbo, president of the Jackson Heights branch of the Parents and Taxpayers, said. The organization grew out of a meeting of parents held after the plan was first disclosed last fall. “I gave up a lucrative job in business to stay home and be ,a mother,” Mrs. Addabbo said during a pause in her morning routine of housework, “I feel what would be the use of staying home if I don't see my children from 8:30 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon?” “I'm not saying that integration isn't a problem,” Mrs. Addabbo said. “But I don't think children can solve a problem that adults haven't been able to solve in 100 years.” The Addabbos are parties in a suit brought by the Parents and Taxpayers to nullify the pairing plan. The organization now claiins 1,556 members in Jackson Heights. The court action is only one of the battles. Another has been an attempt to impeach the officers of the Parents Association of P.S. 149, even though new officers are to be nominated this month. The chief target has been Mrs. Gloria Gold, president of the Parents Association, a former social worker who has been active for several years in efforts to improve P.S. 149. With Mrs. Vilma France, her counterpart at P.S. 92, she led in drawing up the initial Princeton Plan proposal over the summer. They acted after a meeting of parent and community leaders had been, called by the district school superintendents in July to discuss community problems. “When the Princeton Plan was described at the meeting, we anticipated that our two schools would be one of the first pairs,” Mrs. Gold said. “In a desire to see better education, we worked out proposals asking for various additional services that would upgrade both schools. We went to the ' Board of Education with the proposal to assure that we would get these services before presenting the idea to the parents, but the assurances didn't come until four months later ” Improvements Pronilsed She pointed out that the Board of Education had agreed to limit class size at the two schools to 28 pupils, although efforts by the Parents Association to get additional teachers for that purpose had failed two years ago. The adoption of the pairing would also provide added remedial psychologicai and guidance services that had been sought unsuccessfully for P.S. 149, she added. Opponents of the plan have maintained that they are satisfied with their schooI as it is now. “As far as I'm concerned they're facing backward to 1900,” Mrs. Gold said. “The education that was good enough for me in 1930 is not good enough for my sons,” she added, speaking over the clatter of a houseful of boys brought home after school by her two sons. A group called the Citizens Committee for Balanced Schools, which now has 300 members, was formed last fall to support the proposed Princeton Plan in the face of mounting opposition. The‘Princeton Plan has also been supported by religious leaders in the community. Rabbi Yaakov Pollak of Young Israel of Jackson Heights, and Rabbi Myron M. Fenster of the Jewish Ceriter of Jackson Heights, agreed that bigotry and racism were not significant factors motivating the opposition. Negroes Cite Contrasts “I was slightly disappointed in the reaction of the people,” Rabbi Fenster said. “I know that what people are being asked to do does not come easy, but it is not an impossible sacrifice they're being asked to make.” A highly interested “third party” consists of the Negro community in Corona. “There is no guarantee that our children will learn more—but they'll be taught,” Mrs. France said, explaining the position her Parents Association has taken. Mrs. France pointed out that children from Corona, including her 9‐year‐oid son Peter, who have attended predominantly white schools under the openenrollment plan, “can perform on all levels just as we11 as white children” when they are chalIenged and taught properly. A graphic example of the unequal treatment of schools in white and Negro areas, Mrs. France noted, is the $200,000 renovation program now underway at P.S. 92. The antiquated schooI, built in 1910, was number 115 on the priority list for renovation last September. But it was moved to the top of the list when it was scheduled for pairing with a white school. P.S. 149, built in 1935, was completely renovated two years ago, she pointed out.

592-> Thant Urges World to Heed Fulbright's Speech
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., April 21—The Secretary General, U Thant, urged all nations today to follow Senator J. W. Fulbright's advice and think “unthinkable thoughts” about foreign policy. Mr. Thant said at a news conference that he was in general agreement with the basic idea behind the Arkansas Democrat's speech of March 25. In the speech Senator Fulbright analyzed old foreign policy “myths” that he said should be re‐examined in the light of new realities. Mr. Thant remarked that not merely Americans but Asians, Africans, Latin Americans, Russians and Chinese should follow the recommendations of Senator Fulbright and conduct a thorough reappraisal of problems affecting “suspicion versus confidence or trust, hysteria versus calm, rigidity versus flexibility.” The Secretary General emphasized that he was not endorsing specific suggestions by Senator Fulbright, who, among other things, had termed the United States campaign to cut off Cuba's trade with the nonCommunist world a failure. However, Mr. Thant declared that the Fulbright speech was in the same category as the “historic speech” by President Kennedy on June 10, 1963, which urged a re‐examination of United States policy toward the Soviet Union and “peace itself,” Mr. Thant gave a warm welcome to the decisions of the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union, announced yesterday and today, to cut back production of enriched uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons. He called the moves a sign of increased international confidence and expressed the hope that they would lead to an end of nuclear weapons production. The Secretary General was cautious, however, about the outlook for the United Nations attempt to restore peace to Cyprus, where fighting between Greek and Turkish Cypriotes began in December. A peacekeeping force and a mediator are there under United Nations auspices. He disclosed that Greece had agreed to his proposal that the Greek and Turkish troops on Cyprus be placed under the command of Lieut. Gen. Prem Singh Gyani, commander of the United Nations force, but that Turkey had not replied. Cyprus has also agreed that these forces be placed under General Gyani, it was learned. Turkish sources said later that Turkey would not agree unless she obtained prior assurances that General Gyani would not return the Turkish troops, which now hold the road between Nicosia and the port of Kyrenia, to their barracks. The Turkish and Greek troops are stationed on the island under the agreements by which Cyprus became independent of Britain in 1960. In other points in a farranging news conference, Mr. Thant confirmed that Max H. Dorsinville, officer in charge of United Nations operations in the Congo, who is at loggerheads with Premier Cyrille Adoula, would return to New York the first week in May for consultations, but denied that he had resigned. Mr. Thant restated his intention to withdraw the entire Congo force, which is now down to 4,000 men, by June 30, the scheduled date. He said that after the withdrawal of the force Mr. Dorsin‐ ville's post would be abolished and the United Nations would limit itself to providing technical assistance for the Congo. He said that the size of the program would depend upon the amount of voluntary contributions and that the response thus far had been limited. He expressed the hope that current discussioh between the major powers on the United Nations financial crisis would result in a compromise solution. The United States is insisting on enforcement of the Charter provision that the Soviet Union and other members owing more than two year's past contributions lose their vote in the General Assembly. There was no immediate pros‐ pect that the United Nations would be directly involved in the dispute between Indonesia and Malaysia over the formation of the British‐backed federation. However, the Secretary General said that he had communicated “certain ideas” to Indonesia and was awaiting her response.

594-> Wynne in a London Hospital For Rest and a Check‐up
LONDON, April 26—Greville Wynne, the 45‐year‐old British businessman released by the Russians on Wednesday in exchange for a Soviet spy, entered a London hospital today. A woman at his home in London said he had gone into Gordon Hospital, Westminster, for a rest and a check‐up. A hospital spokesman said, “He is resting comfortably.” Mr. Wynne had been held by the Soviet Union for 17 months on charges of spying. His health deteriorated and this was the chief reason given by the British Government in agreeing to exchange him for Gordon Lonsdale, who had been sentenced to 21 years in prison for spying in Britain. Mr. Wynne is said to have lost 42 pounds.

597-> THANT SET RULES FOR CYPRUS FORCE; Commander May Disregard Requests for Help Outside Council's Authorization
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., April 1 — U Thant made public today the arrangements under which the United Nations Cyprus force and Cypriote security forces would aid each other when requested. These provide that the United Nations force will not supply help unless its commander decides that such help is “within the framework” of the Security Council resolution of March 4 establishing the force. On the other hand, Cyprus pledged herself to meet “in a spirit of cooperation” any requests submitted by the United Nations commander for help in carrying out the resolution. According to reliable sources, this means that if Cypriote security forces go into action against Cypriote Turks, Lieut. Gen. Prem Singh Gyani, commander of the United Nations force, will not comply with a Cypriote request for help unless he feels it is in accordance with the Council's decision. Although the Secretary General has instructed the United Nations force not to shoot except in self‐defense, he has also instructed it to interpose itself where necessary to stop fighting between Greek and Turkish Cypriotes. Accordingly, if one of the combatants fired on a United Nations contingent, it would fire back, just as a policeman would if he were trying to sep‐ arate two fighters and one fired on him. The arrangements on relations between the United Nations force and Cypriote security forces were contained in an agreement made in an exchange of letters by Mr. Thant and Spyros A. Kyprianou, the Cypriote Foreign Minister. The agreement is subject to ratification by Cyprus. It is understood that Mr. Thant is eager to avoid a repetition of the difficulties that developed in 1960 between the United Nations Congo force and the Congolese Government. The Security Council resolution that established the Congo force said, in effect, that the force should help the Congolese Government re‐establish law and order. The late Patrice Lumumba, first Congolese Premier, used this provision to support his demand that the United Nations assist the Congolese Army's efforts to bring Katanga Province under its orders. Friction developed as a result of the refusal of the late Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold to comply with Mr. Lumumba's demand. The Council resolution establishing the Cyprus force provides, in effect, that both the Cypriote Government and the United Nations force will restore law and order, However, the resolution does not instruct the United Nations force to help the Cypriote forces.

600-> IN AND OUT OF BOOKS
LIKE politics, and regrettably often a part of it, the matter of race relations, white and black, is one of the haunting problems of the moment. In addition to books already out which discuss the subject, a number of others will be arriving within the next few months, general works as well as those with the problem cloaked in fiction. Most recent, of course, is James Baldwin's “Blues for Mister Charlie,” the play's printed version, which was offered by Dial a fortnight ago to New York, will reach the rest of the country this week. Toward the end of this month, Sheed & Ward will publish “Black, White and Gray,” edited by Bradford Daniel. This contains 21 discussions from such diverse personalities as Mr. Baldwin, Governors Orval E. Faubus of Arkansas and George C. Wallace of Alabama, Martin Luther King and the late Father John LaFarge. Other books include “Why We Can't Wait,” by Dr. King, coming in June from Harper & Row; and “Black Man's America,” by Simeon Booker, the same month from PrenticeHall. Mr. Booker is Washington bureau head for Johnson Publications, which among other things publishes Ebony. In late July, Nat Hentoff's “The New Equality” will be published by Viking; the month before, “Freedom Now!: The Civil Rights Struggle in America,” edited by Alan F. Westin, will come from Basic Books. This will include reports by Dr. King, Mr. Baldwin, Louis B. Lomax and many others. Turning to the fiction side of the coin, June will see, from Macmillan, “Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory,” a novel about Washington and regions to the south, by Tristram Coffin. August will add three other books to the list—“Black and White,” by Ralph Martin, a novel about four Negroes going to Paris, from McKay; “God Bless the Child,” a first novel by Kristin Hunter, a young Negro writer, from Scribner's; “Hurry Sundown,” by the husband‐and‐wife team signing itself K. B. Gilden, from Doubleday; “Look Away, Look Away,” by Ben Haas, from Simon & Schuster. SPEAKING of politics, the rush of numerous individuals toward oblivion or the Republican nomination for the Presidency has been accompanied by a rush of books. There have been books by and about Senator Goldwater, books about Governor Rockefeller. The one that was missing was a book about Gov. William Scranton of Pennsylvania, who's not officially running, but can be pushed. This missing link now has been foundried, has been hammered into shape. “Scranton of Pennsylvania: A Personal and Political Biography,” by Saul Kohler, will be published by Dial late next month. The author is State House correspondent for The Philadelphia Inquirer. AGAIN speaking of politics, there has just come from raw‐Hill, in hardcover and paperback ($3.95 and 95 cents) a book in which this newspaper takes considerable pride. It is “The New York Times Election Handbook 1964,” edited by Harold Faber, with contributions from numerous members of the staff of The Times—such familiar names as James Reston, Tom Wicker, Joseph Loftus, Max Frankel, Cabell Phillips, many more. In addition to describing possible candidates for the Presidency, the book discusses that office itself; takes up possible party strategy; gives voting statistics; crosses the country state by state listing past election returns and the offices, such as Governor and United States Senator, that are to be filled this autumn. Scattered through the volume are such engaging oddments as who was the heaviest candidate for the top national office (William Howard Taft, 332 lbs.), and who was the shortest candidate (James Madison, 5'4”). And at the back there is a scorecard for election night when, the shouting and the tumult having died, the voter can keep track of what he has done. A FEW Sundays ago, a note on this page said that a publishing firm, doing research on authors, had found that the big year for John Creasey, who writes detective stories under that name and many others, was 1940, with 18 titles. As is usual, Mr. Creasey has been underestimated, as witness a note from that gentleman: “In fact there were 24 books in 1940—my record! The next seven years saw an average of 18 a year, but at least ihree each year were 125,000 words or more. Then in 1948 I first visit ed the United States and slowed down to 15 or so a year. Now it's 10. I must be getting old.” ON the future schedule are three books by authors recently died. Next month, Doubleday will publish “Letters From Bohemia,” by Ben Hecht, this being a selection of letters to Mr. Hecht from correspondents such as Sherwood Anderson, H. L. Mencken, Gene Fowler and Mr. Hecht's play collaborator, Charles MacArthur. In July, Geis will publish “Brendon Behan's New York,” a companion piece to “Brendan Behan's Island: An Irish Sketchbook.” Like the earlier work, this will be illustrated by Paul Hogarth. The third book will be published by Harper & Row early next year —Hesketh Pearson's “Extraordinary People.” It will contain biographical essays on 10 Englishmen and an Englishwoman, such figures as Henry Fielding, Wilkie Collins, George Bernard Shaw, Charles Darwin. IT can be stated with little hesitation that one of the important books on the fall list in Paris will be a biography of Gen. Charles Gaulle by one of France's outstanding writers, Francois Mauriac. The idea was Mr. Mauriac's publisher's—Grasset—with the main body of work now done, only revisions remaining. Although the author is a thorough Gaullist, he neither consulted his subject nor did General DeGaulle cooperate on the biography. A number of American publishers have been bidding on the American rights, asking price said to be a high one—about $50,000 in advance on royalties. As M. Mauriac's regular publishers, Farrar, Straus presumably is running the inside track. THIS one may cause a dispute: The Larchmont (N. Y.) Public Library has been sending out drumbeating matter saying that with about 10 authors of books per thousand population, it may have the greatest incidence of citizen authorship in the country. In the same ratio. New York City would have about 80,000 authors. . . . “Not Under Oath,” the autobiography of John Kieran, ex‐sports writer and ex‐Information Please star, will be published in the autumn by Houghton Mifflin. . . . Also on sports, Jim Brosnan, the baseball relief pitcher who wrote “The Long Season” of a couple of seasons back, is remaining away from relief dugouts this year and is working on a novel. Baseball background, of course, with Harper & Row the publishers. . . . A one‐volume biography of George Washington by James Thomas Flexner—winner of the Parkman Prize for “The Wilder Image”—will be published by Little, Brown next year.

605-> LIBYA KING RAISES ABDICATION ISSUE; Offers to Quit, but Officials Are Said to Dissuade Him
TRIPOLI, Libya, March 21 —??ing Idris I indicated today that he wanted to abdicate, but Premier Mahmud Muntasser, other Cabinet members and tribal chiefs are reported to have urged him to stay on. ine 73‐year‐old monarch is meeting with high officials in Tobruk, the current royal residence. The meeting comes amid demands in the Opposition press for the quick termination of British and United States bases in Libya. Libya has already proposed talks on terminating accords tinder which the bases are operated. This matter and a possible Cabinet shakeup are believed to have been discussed by the Ring and his Premier. An extraordinary joint meeting of Parliament is scheduled tomorrow. The King's motives In proposing abdication was linked in diplomatic circles to the bases question and the Cabinet shakeap. It was viewed as a possible bid for support against Nasser- ??te opposition elements. [The Associated Press, quoting the Libyan radio, reported that the King had said he decided to abdicate because of “old age and inability to serve you properly.”] The United States Ambassador, E. Allen Lightner Jr., flew today from Tripoli to Beida, where he was expected to deliver the official United States reply to Mr. Muntasser's request for talks on the future of the United States’ base agreement. The Cabinet and Parliament are meeting in Beida. The State Department has already expressed willingness to’ talk any time but no talks were begun today. Libya's views on the American and British bases were stated by Mr. Muntasser, who was under heavy pressure from the press and a vocal minority in Parliament. on March 9: "Developing world events, the feeling of developing countries, particularly those of Arab countries, on the necessity of reinoving foreign military bases from their territories, and our full support of these feelings, have led the Government to decide not to extend or renew foreign base agreements The Premier wanted to discuss the agreements with United States on Wheelus Air Force Base, a major North Atlantic Treaty Organization training and staging base here, and with Britain on army bases and a Royal Air Force field at El Adem near the United Arab Republic border. This followed a Feb. 22 speech by the Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, in which he urged Libya to follow the example of the United Arab Republic, Iraq and Tunisia by removing all foreign bases. The next day the Libyan Cabinet issued a proclamation affirming that Libya had “no intention” of renewing the British and United states base agreements and pledged support for the Arab cause. The British treaty of friendship expires in 1973 and the United States agreement in 1971. Last Monday the 55‐ember Parliament meeting in Beida adopted a three‐part resolution on the bases, by then a daily target of opposition newspapers. The resolution called for “immediate” negotiations for the purpose of terminating the base agreements.

611-> POWELL GETS STAY IN CONTEMPT CASE; Lawyers Reach Conditional; Agreement on Court Order
Representative Adam Clayton Powell yesterday obtained a conditional stay of a Supreme Court order directing him to appear in court next Monday or, pay the full amount of a $211,500 judgment for defamation of character. The stay was conditional on signing and observing an agreement reached between George Donald Covington, Mr. Powell's lawyer, and Raymond Rubin, lawyer for Mrs. Esther James, the plaintiff. Mr. Powell must sign by 4 P.M. Friday. Mrs. James was awarded the $211,500 by a State Supreme Court jury on April 4. The 66‐year‐old Harlem widow had charged that the Harlem Democrat had falsely called her a bag woman, or graft collector, for the Police Department. The agreement provides that Mr. Powell will submit to an examination of his assets within 15 days after determination of his appeal against the defamation judgment if the appeal goes against him. It also provides that he will not transfer any of his assets pending the appeal, which is to be heard in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court's First Department on Jan. 24. The understanding was reached by the two lawyers yesterday in the chambers of Justice Charles D. Breitel of the Appellate Division. Justice Breitel will sign it when it is returned to him with Mr. Powell's signature and it will then become a court order. Last Friday, State Supreme Court Justice Arthur Markewich held Mr. Powell in contempt of court for failing to appear to answer the defamation judgment. He ordered Mr. Powell to pay the $211,500 or to purge himself by appearing in court next Monday for a determina tion of his ability to pay. Yesterday's agreement stipuiated that Mr. Powell “without conceding the fact or validity of the finding of such contempt” would be deemed purged of contempt and of Justice Markewich's order to pay the full amount when he had complied with the terms of the agreement. The agreement meant in effect that Mr. Powell would waive any claim to Congressional immunity.

612-> POULENC TRIBUTE GIVEN AT MUSEUM; Gold-Fizdale, Pianists, and Souzay, Baritone, Perform
The concert of music by Francis Poulenc given Saturday night thethe Rogers Auditorium in the Metropolitan Museum of Art posed a question. Cxn music be played too well? Can perfection of style steal from substance? To the audience, the answer was thunderously negative. This listener was not so convinced and not so satisfied. Gerard Souzay, baritone, and Arthur Gold and Robert Fizdale, duo‐pianists, shared the program. Their technical perfection was complete, their nuances were apt, their approach was intelligent. Everything was easy, airy, sophisticated and extremely well‐bred. In the opening “Hymne,” in the cycles “Le Bestiaire” and “Chanson Gaillardes” and in many other songs, Mr. Souzay's voice was supple, firm and very expressive. It glided, swooped, sailed, made side comments and was altogether equal to the unusual demands of Poulenc's imagination. For their part, Mr. Gold and Mr. Fizdale played together as though under the same skin. Not only their music, but also their gestures complemented each other. Not a hair, not a note was out of place. As said, the audience Ioved it. “I like Poulenc,” observed a woman a few rows back. “He's very bombastic, very gay, very sentimental.” True, madam. And you could have added that his composing technique is so masterly that everything sounds deceptively easy to play, temptingly so. This is a trap, because in certain moods Poulene needs a touch of careless disorder in performance or he begins to sound precious, especially when heard in a full evening of short works. That's what happened Saturday night. Only at times, though. Mr. Souzay. in “Avant le Cinema,” was careless to just the right degree, and light‐hearted, too. He projected raffishly. And Mr. Gold and Mr. Fizdale lent an air of fond mischief to the very early Sonata, written when Poulenc was 19 years old. 2 New York Premieres An “Elégie Pour Deux Pianos.” written in 1959 and dedicated to the memory of the Countess de Polignac, a close friend of the composer, was given its first New York performance. Another New York first was a capriccio, written in 1952 and dedicated to Samuel Barber. The capriccio is a twopiano version of the finale to “Bal‐Masque,” a secular cantata composed 20 years earlier. The “Elégie” is eloquent and has a surpise ending that is delicious in sonority. The capriccio is pure Poulenc—one part banal, one part supersophisticated. and all parts an example of dazzling composing virtuosity. The Gold‐Fizdale duo also played the “Sonata Pour Deux Pianos,” dedicated to them by the composer, who died last Jan. 30. Dalton Baldwin was Mr. Souzay's accompanist.

615-> On the Fly; At this migration season, some consideration of the nature of birds.
“God made all flying things, Eagle and albatross, With tapered body and spread of outstretched wings To hang against the sunset like a cross.” — “It is astonishing how vio‑ lently a big branch shakes when a silly little bird has left it. I expect the bird knows it and feels immensely arrogant.”— “You rise early in the morning and go outdoors to make a before‐breakfast circuit of the house and sniff the garden air ingrained with gold. But though you think yourself taking the day by the prime, it is already old to the birds.” — “The starling is a mono tone; His voice is flat and raucous. He's very loud when he's alone And louder when in caucus.” — “Birds in general are stupid, in the sense of being little able to meet unforeseen emergencies; but their lives are often emotional, and their emotions are richly and finely expressed.”— “The setting sun will always set me to rights—or if a sparrow come before my window, I take part in its existence and pick about the gravel.” — “One spring morning five swans flew above my barn in single file, going northward—an express train bound for Labrador. It was a more exhilarating sight than if I had seen them in their native haunts. They made a breeze in my mind, like a noble passage in a poem.” — “Here for this hour we are remote from the parochialism of humanity. The bird has admitted a larger air. We breathe deeply of it and are made free citizens of eternity.” —.

616-> ‘EVIDENCE OF GAIETY’
TO THE EDITOR: Mrs. Victor Reusch, in the Letters column of April 5, disagrees with, and even mocks, Lynn Pollack for her generally favorable comment on the Beatles. While indicting Miss Pollack for being a member of an “unsophisticated and naive” audience, Mrs. Reusch overlooks the question of why young people are so enthusiastic about such groups as the Beatles. In examining “our complicated society,” as Mrs. Reusch suggests, a young person is immediately confronted with the shocking death of our President, mass extermination in Hochhuth's “The Deputy,” the possibility of nuclear holocaust, racial tension, brutality and daily reports of Americans being killed in an effort to stave off Communism in South Vietnam. These are frightening thoughts even for adults; for young people with little or no experience in dealing with such facts, they can be overwhelming. The Beatles, with loud and snappy rhythms and unconventional clothes and haircuts, a symbol of youth. Facedwith elements that are capable of destroying all life—both young and seasoned — young people cling to whatever tangible evidences of gaiety there are. The Beatles may not last for very long; the anxieties which contributed to their success will.

618-> U.N. AGENCY WARNS ON NARCOTICS FLOW
GENEVA, Jan. 15—The United Nations Permanent Central Opium Board warned today that a thriving illicit traffic in narcotic drugs threatened the health of millions. The board supervises the administration of international treaties aimed at preventing narcotics manufactured for medical and scientific use from being diverted illegally. “Broadly speaking,” the board said in its annual report to the Economic and Social Council, this aim has been achieved and underworld dealers “are obliged to have recourse to clandestine manufacturers.” However, the report continued, such manufacturers “have no great difficulty” in procuring opium for the production of morphine and heroin. The board was troubled also by estimates that illegal cultivation of the opium poppy sent larger quantities into illegal traffic than the entire world uses for medical purposes. Concern was also expressed over the situation in Bolivia because of the illegal manufacture, of cocaine there. Bolivia, the report said, is apparently the “major source of the considerable quantities” of cocaine now appearing in the international narcotics traffic.

625-> Excerpts From Proposals on Floor Trading
  (a) No member of a national securities exchange, while on the floor of such exchange, shall initiate, directly or indirectly, any transaction in any security admitted to trading on such exchange, for any account in which such member has an interest, or for any account with respect to which such member has discretion as to the time of execution, the choice of security to be bought or sold, the total amount of any security to be bought or sold, or whether any such transaction shall be one of purchase or sale. (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this rule shall not apply to (1) any transaction by a specialist in a security in which he is so registered on such exchange: (2) any transaction by an odd‐lot dealer in a security in which he is so registered on such exchange (3) any stabilizing transaction effected in compliance with Rule 10b‐7 to facilitate a distribution of such security in which such member is participating (4) any bona fide arbitrage transaction; (5) any transaction made with the prior approval of a floor official of such exchange to permit such member to contribute to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market in such security; and (6) any. transaction effected in conformity with a plan designed to eliminate floor trading activities which are not beneficial to the market and which plan has been adopted by an exchange and declared effective by the Commission. For the purpose of this rule, a plan filed with the Commission by a national securities exchange shall not become effective unless the Commission, having due regard for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, for the public interest, and for the protection of investors, declares the plan to be effective. (c) For the purpose of this rule the term “on the floor of such exchange” shall include the trading floor; the rooms, lobbies, and other premises immediately adjacent thereto; other rooms, lobbies and premises made available primarily for use by members generally; and the telephone and other facilities in any such place. (d) Any national securities exchange may apply for an exemptions from the provisions of this rule under Section 11(c) of the Act because of the limited volume of transactions on such exchange. (1) A member activity known as the “registered trader” would be established by the Exchange. (2) Each member registered as a trader would be required to meet an initial minimum capital requirement of $250,000 over and above the capital required for the member's other activities . . . In order to engage in floor trading, members would also be required to show a fami‐1 iarity with the requirements applicable to registered traders through an appropriate examination. (3) Registered traders would be prohibited from executing brokerage orders and floor trading in the same security during a single trading session. (4) A series of new rules would compel registered traders to conduct their business in a way calculated to contribute to the orderliness of markets and to prohibit them from engaging in transactions which have disruptive effects: a. Destabilizing acquisitions of a security above the previous day's closing price in such security would be prohibited: b. At least 75 per cent of all registered trader acquisitions and 75 per cent of all liquidations (except for liquidations at a loss) would have to meet a “stabilization” test (i.e., purchases below the last different price and sales above the last different price would be considered stabilizing.) This performance test would be computed on a monthly basis. c. Present Exchange rules which now prohibit members from trading on the floor in such a way as to “dominate” markets in the acquisition of a position would be extended to cover liquidations of positions. (5) Registered traders in the acquisition of positions would have to yield the floor to orders originated off the floor by giving up priority based on time and parity with or precedence based on size over, such orders, and would also yield precedence based on size when liquidating positions (6) The Exchange will within the limits of the system capabilities, proceed with the automation of the surveillance of registered trader's transactions as a first step in the automation of the surveillance of all floor activities. *If losses in a registered trader's account exceed about $75'000, additional capital would have to be deposited.

627-> RADIO‐AID CHARGE STIRS SOCCER FANS; Roma Says Banished Coach Plotted Bologna's Plays
ROME, March 23—Did a disqualified soccer coach clandestinely direct his team by walkietalkie in an important championship game yesterday? This seemed to be the only question that interested Italy today, judging by what was written in the newspapers and what espresso bar patrons were discussing all day. Professional soccer, or European football, in Italy is a multimilliondollar branch of the entertainment industry that is rapidy shedding all pretense of having anything to do with sports. A crowd of 60,000 Roman fans and a sprinkling of Bologna followers jammed the Olympic Stadium, which had seen some real sport during the 1960 Olympic Games. There was a shortlivedshow of courtesy by the hosts when the visiting eleven entered the field. One generous Roman waved a sign expressing the Eternal City's “solidarity” with the Bologna club, which had been disciplined by National Soccer. Federation judges for the alleged use of stimulants by players two weeks earlier. But a storm gathered soon. The referee (“too small a man for a game bigger than he,” a local newspaper said today) awarded a penalty to the Bologna team, and Roma suffered a goal. “Dope fiends,” roared the fans in the arena. The Olympic Stadium was still shaking with the shouts of “Dope fiends!” yesterday when one Roma fan saw Fulvio Bernardini, the Bologna coach, high in the bleachers, holding in front of his face what looked like a transistor radio. The fan, obviously an amateur sleuth, alerted the general staff of the Roma club. A photographer took a picture of Bernardini, still with his small radio before his face. Today the picture was splashed across most of the front pages of the nation's newspapers. Bernardini had been barred by the National Soccer Federation judges last week until Sept. 21, 1965 for his role in the Bologna drugging affair. Right after yesterday's match, won by Bologna, 2—0. Roma filed a formal complaint with the soccer federation alleging that the disqualified coach had interfered with the match by radio. The charge said that Bernardini had been holding a miniature radio phone over which he gave strategy orders to Bologna's acting coach, Dr. Antonio Bovina, who was standing on the edge of the field. Dr. Bovina was searched after the game and he was found to be in possession of a tiny Japanese transistor radio. Later the Rome team decided not to press the complaint because it would cause more trouble for Bernardini.

628-> CENTRAL TO BEGIN ZONEF ARE TRIAL
The New York Central Rail­road will begin selling commu­tation tickets tomorrow under its new zone‐fare system that goes into effect on Feb. 1. The experimental plan, to be tried for a year, was approved last week by the Public Service Commission. It provides for the sale of tickets by zone instead of on the basis of mileage to individual stations. The plan will be effective on the railroad's Hudson division to stations between Grand Central Termminal and Tarrytown and on the Harlem division between the terminal and White Plains North Station. About 23,000 of the railroad's 31,000 commuters will be af­fected. Commuters north of Tarrytown and White Plains North Station are not included in the trial. According to the railroad, the new fare plan will mean an in­crease of no more than 4 cents, a ride for most commuters and a decrease for some others. However, about 300 passengers, who are among the so‐called “Bronx group,” will pay sub­stantially higher fares, in a few cases nearly double what they now pay. These riders generally are persons who are willing to pay the higher fares in order to escape the discomforts of rush­hour subway travel. In an interview in his office at 466 Lexington Avenue, Wil­liam R. Main, the railroad's as­sistant vice president in charge of passenger sales and service, acknowledged that some com­muters had sharply criticized the zone‐fare system. Sometimes bitterly, and oc­casionally loudly, the passen­gers wonder why their stations were placed in the more expen­sive north zone rather than in the cheaper neighboring zone to the south. For example, a commuter from the Mount St. Vincent sta­tion on the Hudson Division will pay $23 a month under the new zone plan, or 87 cents less than he now pays for traveling the 12.8 miles to Grand Central Terminal. But the commuter from the Ludlow station, less than a mile to the north, will pay $26 a month, or $1.12 more than he pays now. Mount St. Vincent is near the northern border of the Bronx; Ludlow is near the southern border of Westches­ter County. The hardest hit of all will be the riders whose stations are at 125th Street in Manhattan and 138th Street in the Bronx. According to Mr. Main, an average of seven passengers a month in the last year have commuted between 125th Street and Grand Central, and 15 pas­sengers a month between 138th Street and the terminal. The 125th Street and 138th Street passengers have been paying for their commutation tickets $12.70 and $13.30 a month, respectively. Under the zone system these passengers will pay $23 a month. The 125th Street station is 4.2 miles from Grand Central: the 138th Street station is five miles from the terminal. Mr. Main explained that many of the costs of carrying a pas­senger from Grand Central to 138th Street, for example, were just about the same as carrying him to a more distant station. After the passenger gets off, the seat usually remains vacant. “The line had to be drawn somewhere,” Mr. Main said. “The zones were drawn to re­flect passenger usage and cost of service . . . that would at the same time be equitable to all commuters. “Our commuters are accus­tomed to mileage‐based fares, which do not adequately reflect the actual costs. . . .” After asserting that the rail­road was losing about $1 million a year on its commuter service, Mr. Main said: “We hope that our new zone­fare system will lead ultimately to lower costs of operation and reduce the deficits incurred an­naully in the commuter serv­ice.” Mr. Main said that among the economies that might be­come possible under the zone system were a simplified meth­od of printing and collecting tickets. “Even with our new zone fares,” he said, “our charges to the commuters are for the most part, lower than those charged by the Long Island Rail Road, the New Haven and the Pennsylvania.” He added that the system nad been used successfully by the Southern Pacific Railroad in San Francisco and by the Ca­nadian National Railroad in Montreal. .

630-> ECONOMIST HAILS SEA WAY'S FUTURE; Says It Can Serve an Area Without Parallel in World
The St. Lawrence Seaway will have the opportunity in future years of serving an economic area without parallel anywhere in the world, according to an educator who studied the waterway from its inception. Prof. John L. Hazard of Michigan State University, who was an economic consultant on the staff of the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, made the prediction over the weekend following a meeting of seaway experts in Cleveland. He said the seaway area had a vast potential that waterway operators in both Canada and the United States had not begun to realize. Several seaway experts were pessimistic about the waterway's future. Mr. Hazard, however, holds that the potential is tremendous, and outweighs disadvantages discussed at the conference, which was attended by port officials, shippers and industry representatives. The hinterland that the seaway can serve includes the North Central States around the Great Lakes and the more developed parts of Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Professor Hazard said. “This mid‐continent is an economic formation unique in history,” he declared. “For the first time in the history of any continent, balance of papulation and economic power has shifted to the interior.” In connection with his comments, he made public the transcript of a presentation he made last month to a Senate subcommittee on commerce that is now studying the seaway. In it, he described the area as “now exceeding the East in agriculture, population and industrial production and employment.” ‘Powerful Regional Unity’ “Its population node, Chicago, is 200 miles farther from the ocean than is Moscow,” he said. “Rapid industrialization at the interior has swept across the border, forging a powerful regional unity in which the states and provinces are far more integrated and interdependent than are the members of the European Common Market. “Yet the region appears to be almost entirely unconscious of the dimensions of its own regionality, let alone the paradoxes that surround its existence,” he continued. “Among the paradoxes is the term ‘Midwest’ for an area that is really closer to the East than it is to the West,” he said. “Considered to be an agrarianbased economy, the mid‐continent is actually as industrial as it is agricultural. Considered to be isolationist, the mid‐continent actually generates more foreign trade than any other region of the United States or Canada. “But [it] never has acquired a voice commensurate with its economic power, particularly in matters of foreign economic policy,” he declared. The area, Professor Hazard noted, is about 1,285,000 square miles, with a population of around 60 million, a highly productive population that produces more than 29 per cent of the North American personal income and more than 42 per cent of the farm income. He said the region produced about 22 per cent of the combined mineral resources of the two countries, yet consumed in excess of 40 per cent. Hence, he declared, it has become a heavy importer of metals, energy fuels and forestry resources. Moreover, the country is in a “massive export drive” and the seaway offers a low cost outlet, Professor Hazard said. He urged more attention to development of the seaway on the part of governmental agencies and an extension of the authority that the Seaway Development Corporation and Canada's St. Lawrence Seaway Authority now have to act on their own.

633-> Safety Experts Debate Stricter Driving Tests
RECOMMENDATIONS for stiffer driving tests as a means of reducing accidents have traffic experts the world over in a quandary. They can't agree on whether tougher examinations would help or not. That some solution is necessary is evident from the statistics that appear regularly in the newspapers, particularly around holidays, when almost every carfamily is on the highways. In the United States last year, motor vehicle accidents, the nation's fourth‐ranking killer, claimed 43,400 victims, 3 per cent more than in 1962. There seems to be wide agreement by safety officials on one thing: the bad‐record driver is likely to be the fatal‐accident driver, too. This, they say, is reason enough to be concerned about the record of every driver and not merely his ability to pass a test, no matter how stiff it is. The Office of Highway Safety of the Department of Commerce, for example, believes that “no single program is the answer to all highway safety programs.” It maintains: “We need the combined ef‐ forts of highway engineers, police officers, traffic court judges, licensing officials and vehicle manufacturers—plus the cooperation of the public‐if we are to keep down the terrible toll of death and human misery on the highways of the nation.” In Britain, the Ministry of Transport places the blame for accidents largely on the driver, not the testing program. “Too many drivers take their tests before they are competent enough to stand a reasonable chance of passing,” a spokesman said. “The pass rate is now only 51 per cent of all candidates taking the test.” The problem is manifold in that country. More than two million learners apply for testing each year, and it is estimated that about 500,000 of them are taught by schools. Ministry of Transport officials are planning to set up an official register of driving instructors in the hopes of raising standards. As part of a new program of control, the ministry plans to require learners to undergo a year or two years of “probation” before they may qualify for a license. This approach probably would prove acceptable to many critics in this country. Car and Driver Magazine, for example, insists that the driver is at fault. The magazine's solution? “We'd like to see a tough enough examination that perhaps a third of the people now driving cars would fail. We'd like to force them into re‐education programs that would help force their skill levels up to modern driving requirements. Those who could still not pass, could not drive.” Here, the type of testing done in France could be explored, although the French are among the world's fastest and strangest drivers. Road tests and written tests are stern, and failures of two or three tests are not unusual. In some cases, the French make medical examinations every five years mandatory. The French traffic code explains: “To drive without faults is of major importance to the driver, to the safety of other passengers, for the vehicle and in order to pass the examination for a driving permit.” In all traffic manuals issued to drivers in France there is the simple admonition: “The driver must remain the master of his speed.” To achieve this, the Government requires that certain types of vehicles must be equipped with a speed recorder that allows for a reading to make it possible to control the speed of the vehicle for at least three months. The thinking behind this is that after three months, the driver can sense how well he is staying within the speed limits. The French also sharply reduce speed limits on major holidays, summer vacations and warm weekends. Where the right road is nobody knows. Burton W. Marsh, a former executive of the American Automobile Association, feels that “the objective should be not to make tests tougher but to make them more valid, more meaningful.” He said:“We have got to learn a lot more about the driving task; about the qualities and advance preparation that equip a person to cope with these tasks, and about the types of tests that will determine driving ability.”

635-> Excessive Control of Predators
Secretary of the Interior Udall's advisory committee on wildlife management has sounded along‐needed warning about the excesses and errors of the Government's branch of Predator and Rodent Control. Among the errors cited by the committee is the dangerous aerial broadcasting of grain treated with sodium fluoroacetate, a deadly poison known in the trade as “compound 1080.” This practice was held responsible for the death last year of two birds from the tiny flock of California condors that is the last survivor of its kind on earth. Many other valuable animals, including rare grizzly bears and mountain lions, have been killed inadvertently. Wolves and other wild beasts are no longer the threat to domestic herds and flocks they once may have been. Indeed, the true wolf is almost gone in the United States outside of Aaska. The coyote still harasses sheepmen in some places, but this is a problem that could be handled effectively and at far less cost by concentration of efforts in local areas. Secretary Udall's committee pointed out that “control” operations now extend into areas where there are no sheep or other valid justification. Congress must share the blame for the outsize growth of the predator control agency, which now employs more than 600 trappers and poisoners in the Western states. For the most part, Congre s has closed its eyes while its appropriation committees annually doled out larger funds at the request of the wool growers' association and as a result of indirect lobbying by the predator control agents themselves. Certainly the problem does not require the present army of Government hunters. Here is a fine chance for some of that governmental economy the President has been talking about.

636-> SOVIET REPORTS RISE IN INCOMES; Survey Is Cited to Counter Complaints About Prices
MOSCOW, Jan. 11—An official Soviet analysis of 100 family budgets shows that family income rose from 162 rubles a month to 211 rubles in an 11month period ended in 1961, or from the equivalent of $178 to $232. The survey, published in the weekly economic newspaper Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta and reprinted in Izvestia, the Government newspaper, said that in 1951 none of the families, selected from workers' households in the industrial cities of Moscow, Ivanovo and Gorky, had television sets, refrigerators or washing machines. Three years ago 42 of the 100 families had television sets and 10 had refrigerators but only five had washing machines. Although it was evident that for propaganda purposes some more prosperous families had been included in the study, it was useful in furnishing information on the upper levels of the standard of living in the Soviet Union. Living conditions in Soviet industrial centers are generally superior to those in rural areas. Although the survey did not explicitly say so, it was evident from per capita figures that the average family size had declined from slightly more than four to 3.6 persons in the 11year period. The income figures become meaningful if it is noted that there normally are two or more wage earners in each Soviet family. This would suggest that the average monthly wage rose from at most 80 rubles to about 100, or $88 to $111. The survey showed changes in the food and clothing budgets. In food, it suggested less spending on bread and potatoes, traditional staples, and more on fresh fruit, fish, dairy products and meat. The average diet contained 70 to 80 per cent more animal proteins and fats in 1961 than in 1951. Although the purchases of yard goods remained virtually unchanged, the survey showed a trend toward more silk‐like materials, including synthetics, and wool, with a decline in cotton. A large percentage of clothing, especially women's wear, is still being sewn at home or in tailoring establishments. The survey suggested that crowded housing conditions continued even for the apparently better‐off group represented in the study. Floor space per person rose from 48 square feet to 68 square feet in the 11 years. In family terms, the average housing space increased to 240 square feet, the equivalent of one large or two small rooms for a family of four. This allotment does not include the kitchen, bathroom and corridors, which usually are communally shared. The average budget showed that the largest increases in expenditures were for entertainment and the purchase of furniture household appliances, clothing and shoes. The outlays for rent, utilities, fuel and food showed only a slight rise. The publication of the budget survey appeared to be part of a press campaign to counter grumbling over seeming increases in the cost of living. In seeking to rebut such complaints, Soviet propagandists have stressed the heavy state contribution in low‐rent housing and in free or minimalcost services such as health care and education.

637-> Chiang Sees U.S. as Peking Target
TAIPEI, Taiwan, April 4 (AP)—Americans should face the fact that Communist China's “ultimate aim is the defeat of the United States,” Generalissimo Chiang Kai‐shek said today. General Chiang declared that “despite encouraging remarks” such as Senator J. W. Fulbright's statement March 25 that Washington should think about flexibility toward Peking, “to the Chinese Communists the United States is and always will be enemy No. 1.” In an interview, the 76‐yearold President of the Nationalist Chinese Government on Tawian asserted that relations between Moscow and Peking had “already reached the point of no return” as long as their present rulers are in power. Calling for action against the Communist regime in China, he said, “I am certain the Russians will not intervene.” “American tactics in Vietnam have proved unsuccessful so far,” General Chiang said. He added, however, that removing United States military forces from South Vietnam would be inconceivable. The Nationalist leader, who has hoped for years to return to the mainland with his Government, discussed international affairs for an hour. He rose from his seat once to point out on a map what might happen if the United States changed its policies in Asia. He predicted that Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and even the Philippines would fall to a Communist onslaught. President Chiang seemed in excellent health and he answered most questions with a quick smile. His eyes grew misty when he recalled his friendship with General of the Army Douglas A. MacArthur, and he said he prayed daily for him. There were sparks, however, as he commented on the statement by Senator Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that Americans should “jar open our minds to certain realities about China, of which the foremost is that there are not really two Chinas, but one, and that it is ruled by the Communists.” “Such remarks will only encourage the Communists to hate and insult your country more,” General Chiang said. “I feel Senator Fulbright is not fully informed of the conditions existing on the mainland of China today. The Communist Chinese regime is built on nothing but brute force. Bayonets keep the people under control. The regime totally lacks popular support. It will never last. It is here today but may be gone tomorrow.” On the ideological conflict between the Chinese and Soviet Communists, General Chiang said: “The Chinese Communist attacks on the Russian Communists and the Moscow rebuttals show very clearly the serious state of affairs on the mainland, politically, economically, militarily and in the party and the armed forces “It is no longer necessary for the United States to feel that action to remove the source of all trouble in Asia will touch off a global war. I am certain the Russians will not intervene.” The general asserted that all trouble in Asia, from Korea to India, could be traced to the Chinese Communists. “Piecemeal efforts against them will fall short of removing the source of the trouble,” he said. “There will be no peace in the Far East unless the cause of the trouble is removed.” On the conflict in South Vietnam, where the United States has 16.000 men supporting the war against the Communist Vietcong, President Chiang recalled the French defeat at Dienbienphu in 1954. “If the United States were to withdraw from Vietnam,” General Chiang said, “what would there be to prevent the Chinese Communists from thinking that the United States would follow the French example, one day admit defeat and even recognize them ?”

638-> ECONOMY OF U.S. Is IN FULL BLOOM; Big Spending of Consumers and Businessmen Keeps the Outlook Healthy; INFLATION IS A WORRY; Wage‐Price Levels Watched —Recovery Movement Is in Its 38th Month
Spring is here, Easter is here and the nation's economy is full of rare bounce and vigor. Business conditions are very good indeed, and before the next big snow flies they’re liable to get even better. There's nothing like a recession cloud on the horizon. Far from it. Massive spending, on the retail level by consumers and by businessmen for plant and equipment, promises to keep the economy at or near record levels for many months to come—if not longer. The main concern now appears to be over whether the current strong economic surge will turn into a runaway boom. Such a development could touch off a new wave of price inflation and, in due course, a business contraction or “bust.” The recovery movement, dating from the bottom of the last recession, is now heading into its 38th month. This is already the second longest expansion period since World War II, exceeded only by the 45‐month stretch in 1949‐53, which covered the Korean War. But for the present, at least, exuberance holds sway and the inood is sanguine. “Confidence in the business outlook,” says the Morgan Guaranty Bank, “is stronger than at any time in the past four years.” One reason for that confidence is that the economy has just gone through the winter without any of the usual coldweather retraction. Instead, such major indicators as industrial production, personal income, retail sales and factory orders all reached record highs: Factory employment exparided more than seasonally, corporate profits swelled and cash dividends increased. Wall Street took note of all this and stocks, on average at least, soared to historic highs again and again as one of the greatest bull markets ever rolled on. Factories were humming as industrial output in February not only set a record for the fifth straight month but chalked up the largest advance since last October. The Federal Reserve Board's index of production rose to 127.6 per cent of the 1957‐59 average from 127.2 per cent in January. A year earlier, the index stood at 120.2 per cent of the 1957‐59 period. Last month, then, maaufacturing activity was more than 6 per cent higher than a year ago, with every major industry showing a substantial step‐up. Another indication that it was an unusual winter showed up in new factory orders. In January, normally not one of the strongest months, orders poured into factories at a record rate of $36.7 billion, up 3 per cent from the December volume and well above the previous record of $35.7 billion attained last April. Orders for durable goods alone in January jumped 8 per cent to $19.4 billion. In February, there was a slight dip in this incoming business to $19.3. billion. However, boding well for the future, the backlog of unfilled durable goods orders at the end of last month added up to a huge $47.2 billion, up from $46.9 billion a month earlier. Moreover, there's every sign that new orders will hold at a high level for some time. In January, for instance, total business inventories declined $150 million. It was the first such drop in two and a half years. The inventory over accumulation that marked previous expansion periods has been noticeably absent from this one—another healthy development. The tax cut took effect early this month, but even before that happy day people had more nioney to spend than ever before. Personal income last montlx rose $200 million from the January level to a record annual rate of $478.3 billion. To put last month's figure into perspective, the gain in February was more than $2 billion if a. special dividend payment on veterans’ insurance is excluded from the January figure. Wage and salary payments in February were at an aimual rate of $323.8 billion. The key here was the factory pay ro1l rate, $101.8 billion, up $700 million from the January level. Two‐thirds of the rise reflected longer work hours a week, the resta greater number of jobs. And people were spending on a big scale well before the tax cnt sweetened their take‐home pay. Retail sales, in fact, set successive records in the three months from December through February. Over that period they climbed from $20.9 billion to $21.17 billion. The February retail volume was 4 per cent above the year‐ago figure and that is the rate by which sales have been consistently toppling the 1963 pace. This year, significantly, the usual post‐Christmas letdown in consumer spending failed to develop. One reason more people were spending is that more were working — another contra‐seasonal development. Some rise in unemployment is normal dur ing the winter. Here, again, 1964 has uroved a maverick. Last month employment increased 774,000 to 68,002,000. The gain in nonfarm jobs was 837,000, or twice the seasonal increase. The gain over a year in unemployment is normal durbefore was, in fact, the largest Since 1960, and exceeded the average annual rise since the late nineteen‐forties. Meanwhile, the ranks of tne unemployed as of mid‐February were down 41,000 to 4,524,000. That represented 5.4 per cent of the work force, against 5.6 per cent in January. The unemployment rate has fluctuated between 5.4. per cent and 5.9 and is now back to the lower end of that range. More encouraging: the rate of joblessness among married men, family breadwinners, fell last month: to 3 per cent, or about where it was in 1957. That was the last year in which over‐all unemployment held to around 4 per cent of the labor force, a figure sometimes cited as normal for a so‐called “full-employment” economy. So much tor Ene uroau, general measurements of the economy's strength. As far as specific industries go — and these three are really going at a fast clip—automobiles, steel and construction hold the spot-light Auto production has been rolling along at a record pace. output in the first quarter now ending came to more than 2.14 million new cars, 11 per cent greater than in the 1963 period and slightly above the previous high for the period set in 1955. And sales? At the beginning of this year, auto producers were predicting the third banner year in a row. They had set their sights hopefully on a total volume in 1964 of about 7.5 million, down a bit from last year's 7.7 million, including imports. Now they are talking of an eight million sales year, and with some reason. Sales of domestic new cars in the first quarter were at an annual rate of 7.75 million and in February the rate accelerated to nearly eight million. The auto industry is tne biggest single consumer of steel and the latter industry is benefiting accordingly. So far this Year, mills have been turning out an annual rate of 120 million tons, or 10 per cent above last year's total of 109 million tons. The previous record output was 117 million tons in 1955 and although that figure is not expected to be topped, industry leaders would not be surprised if 1964's final production amounted to 113 million tons or so. At latest report, the nation's rnills were operating at more than 75 per cent of capac‐ity and production was at the highest level since last June. Construction is another major consumer of steel. In February new housing starts ran at an annual rate of 1,643,000 :units. That represented a dip of 5 per cent below the January pace of 1,729,000, but last month's activity was still 19 per scent above that of a year earlier. There's solid evidence that. over‐all construction will pick up even more momentum in the months ahead. Building contracts, as tabulated by the F. W. Dodge Company, in February were 10 per cent over the yearago level. Last month there was a 17 per cent rise in contracts for new residential build ings, the biggest single type of construction. Another harbinger of future activity comes from orders for machine tools. While these dipped last month from an extraordinarily high level in January, they were still 32 per cent greater than a year ago. Machine tool orders so far this year are 70, per cent ahead of the 1963 rate. They were reported as continuing brisk in March. Confidence is an intangible thing, but it can be an important,motive force in an expanding economy. Consumer confidence in the economy has been increasing in recent months and this winter was at a seven‐year high, according to, the latest survey made by the University of Michigan's research center. Several factors were cited for the strengthening in sentiment. These included “more awareness of good news” than in previous prolonged periods of prosperity. Also mentioned was the dispelling of uncertainty over the business outlook that followed the assassination of President Kennedy in November. The easing of international tensions was said to be another favorable factor. Businessmen are sharing in the general optimism. Still another survey, this one by the Department of Commerce, shows that manufacturers expect their sales to rise 6 per cent this year. What's more, they see most of the rise occuring during the second half, indicating a belief that the current upturn will extend throughout 1964 and probably well into 1965 at the very . least. The sales gain in manufactured items last year was 4 per cent. Estimates of the gross national product—the sum of all goods and services—are almost constantly being revised upward. Most observers of the economic scene now project a gross national product of between $623 billion and $626 billion for 1964, up from $585 billion last year. Last December, a figure of $620 billion was widely foreseen for this year. The $11.5 billion tax cut is undoubtedly the biggest single economic development of the year—of many years, say some. It is counted on to provide a major stimulus to consumer spending. The tax reduction, it has been estimated, will add $8 billion this year alone to consumer disposable income. How much of this will actually be translated into cash on the line for cars, appliances, furniture, clothing, travel and so on remains to be seen. The weekly retail sales reports, especially of department stores in the Easter shopping period, would indicate that there has been some effecton spending already. The tax cut, of course, also benefits corporations. One direct and highly important result is already apparent in steppedup plans for spending for plant and equipment. Capital spending in 1964, according to a joint survey of the Commerce Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, will rise 10 per cent to $43.2 billion. That follows a 5 per cent rise last year to a record of $39.22 billion. Something like a real capital, spending boom, reminiscent of the 1955‐57 period, is thus in the making. If the Government's estimate of a 10 per cent riss in spending this year is realized, that will mean a 34 per cent climb in these outlays from the low point;in 1961. In the .:195860 busines upturn capital ex penditures rose 23 percent and in 1955‐57 the increase was 47 per cent. But things are different this year. As the CIeveland Trust Company points out: “Unlike the 1955-57 periodthe rise . of capital spending shows signs of supplementing the surge of consumer spending, rather than replacing it, particularly in the automotive industry.” It is this double-barreled injection of spending into the economy that has raised once again the specter of inflation. In recent weeks there have been some scattered price increases in raw materials, most notably in such basic metals as copper, aluminum, lead and zinc. A few fabricated products in the steel, aluminum and copper lines have gone up and prices of industrial chemicals have firmed from, depressed levels. However, in general, most industrial prices are still below the highs of four or five years ago. Meanwhile, the consumer price index had at latest calculation risen to a record high at 107.7 per cent of the 1957‐59 average. This index, often used as a measurement of the cost of living, has edged up about 1.2 per cent annually during the last five years. Few see an immediate resurgence of inflation, but even so the Johnson Administration has served notice that it expects both labor and management to exercise wage‐price restraint. Something of a showdown on this issue may occur this summer when automobile wage contracts run out. The United Auto Workers Union has indicated it will seek pay and fringe benefits of at least 4.9 per cent. That's the amount of the union's estimate of the annual rise in production in the auto industry from 1947 through 1963. The President's Council of Economic Advisers has put the productivity rise for all industry in the last five years at an average of 3.2 per cent a year and has suggested that wage increases be held within that figure. Last week at the annual convention of the Auto Workers, President Johnson referred once again to the need to hold the line. “We must not,” said the President, “choke off our needed and speedy economic expansion by a revival of the price‐wage spiral.” The possibility of inflation aside, the economic outlook is bright — unusually so. Those Soaring Sixties that everyone was talking about a few years ago may yet materialize. It wouldn’t hurt, however, to keep your fingers crossed.

641-> Random Notes From All Over: Alphabetical Title's Initial Blow; Plan Would Erase TOOTH's Designation—Terry Hears Some Nonsmokers Switch
WASHINGTON, March 29—If there is an AFEAMIG in the Government (and many people think there should be) it could very well start out doing something about TOOTH. AFEAMIG, of course, is the Agency for Elimination of Alphabetical Monstrosities in Government. TOOTH is an organization that blossomed in the Marithne Administration for Those Having Over One Thousand Hours (of accumulated sick leave). Actually it is a club within MARAD (Maritime Administration) and recently SecComm (Luther H. Hodges) handed out prizes for TOOTH members with the healthiest records. One solution suggested for AFEAMIG would be to turn TOOTH over to MAW (Marine Air Wing) with orders to jettison along SLAR (Slant Range) without RUM (remote underwater manipulator). Surgeon General Luther L. Terry told an audience the other day about an unexpected result of his report on smoking and health. He was stopped on the way into the Public Health Service by a colleague who said. “The Smoking report, I can tell you, certainly has had an effect on the National Institutes of Health. Why, there are dozens of people on the staff smoking pipes who never smoked in their lives before!”

643-> Saigon Introduces Conscription To Bolster Grass‐Roots Forces
SAIGON, South Vietnam, April 5 — South Vietnam announced today that it intends to begin drafting men into provincial and local units of its armed forces. The new draft law, Just drawn up by the Government of Premier Nguyen Khanh, appears to be designed to bring the South Vietnam Civil Guard and the Self‐Defense Corps up to strength. These so‐called paramilitary forces bear the brunt of most attacks by the Vietcong, South Vietnam's Communist guerrillas. Volunteers have all but dried up in many areas, and the manpower shortage has been compounded by an increasing wave of desertions. [Robert S. McNamara, United States Secretary of Defense, said March 29 that the United States would pay $50 million a year in addition to its current aid of $500 million to help South Vietnam add 50,000 men to its armed forces by conscription.] The Government, which announced early today that it expected to hold elections for a National Assembly in four to six months, said that the timing would depend on the “degree of security in the country.” According to observers here, the degree of security will depend to a large extent on the success of the Government in building and improving the paramilitary units. General Khanh seized power Jan. 30 and rules as the successor to the junta that overthrew the regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem last Nov. 2. President Diem's National Assembly was dissolved after his Government fell. It is believed that the selfdefense corps, which guards villages and the countryside, is at least 30 per cent below its authorized strength of 72,000. The civil guard, which provides a paramilitary force in each of South Vietnam's 43 provinces, is believed to be 15 to 20 per cent below its authorized strength of 80,000.

644-> FRANCE ASSURES BRITAIN ON TALKS; Says Cambodia Parley Need Not Seek Neutral Vietnam
LONDON, Feb. 28—France has assured Britain that she will not seek to use a conference on Cambodia to promote President de Gaulle's policy of neutralization for South Vietnam. Reliable sources who reported this today said the assurance had been given by France's Foreign Minister, Maurice Couve de Murville, to British officials. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's head of state, has asked that an international conference be called to guarantee his country's neutrality. Both the United States and South Vietnam fear that the conference could be turned into a forum for undermining the Governments of South Vietnam and Thailand, another of Cambodia's neighbors. Both counties have frontier disputes with Camboida. It was not known whether Mr. Couve de Murville had been asked for the assurances or whether he had volunteered them. Britain and the Soviet Union are co‐chairmen of the 1954 Geneva conference from which the successor states to French Indochina‐Cambodia, Laos and North and South Vietnamemerged. The United States, South Vietnam and Thailand have opposed Prince Sihanouk's call for a 14‐nation or a nine‐nation conference. Butthey are reported to be considering a later proposed by the Prince for a fourpower meeting that would “recognize” Cambodia's neutrality and her frontiers. The Soviet Union has favored a large conference. Britain, avoiding a stand, has circulated among the interested parties a protocol of neutrality for Cambodia. The hope here is that a conference would not be necessary if the protocol could be agreed on through diplomatic channels. The chances of such agreement seem slim since the Russians have reiterated their support for Prince Sihanouk's demands. President de Gaulle's decision to recognize Communist China and his projection of France into the troubled Asian situation have annoyed the British. They are concerned about any weakening of the United States position there because of its possible effect on Maylasia, which is made up of former British territories. The British attitude toward President de Gaulle's neutralization policy was summed up in a recent speech by R. A. Butler, Britain's Foreign Secretary. The harsh facts of the situation in Southeast Asia, Mr. Butler said, are “not to be conjured away by phrases about neutralization in agreement with China.” The British believe that China sought French recognition eagerly for a number of reasons, the main one being, perhaps, to exploit AmericanFrench differences and intensify the strains in the Western alliance.

645-> France and Poland Sign Pact
PARIS, Feb. 5 (AP)—France and Poland signed a commercial agreement today that heralded an expansion of French trade With the Communist bloc. The signing was coupled with an announcement that a fiveyear commercial pact with the Soviet Union was being planned. It will be a major effort to remedy the trade deficit of last year, when France bought more then twice as much goods from. the Soviet Union as she sold. The Polish treaty provides for the sale of French wheat, barley and corn from the harvests of 1965, 1966 and 1967. It was signed in the Finance Ministry. Finance Minister Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who recently returned from Moscow, signed the accord with Witold Trampczynski, the Polishi Ministcr of Foreign Trade. The total value of the agreement wes not a 1nounced.

646-> Art: Lachaise Exhibition; Sculptor's Work Seen in Show at Whitney
ON the theory, perhaps untenable, that the function of a critic is to speak his mind rather than to endear himself to a large public, it becomes the duty of this observer to report that Gaston Lachaise, the French‐American sculptor who died in 1935 and who, before and since, has been held in very high esteem, looks just terrible in a big show that opened at the Whitney Museum of American Art yesterday. The fault is not the Whitney's, unless you want to say that it is unfair to assemble 86 sculptures and 40 drawings (and two pieces of jewelry) by an artist who, as it turns out, doesn't stand up under this summary. How anyone can go through this exhibition and come out of it with his regard for Lachaise undiminished, I do not see • The handful of most famous sculptures on which this regard can still rest are included, with, naturally, the famous “Standing Woman” of 1912–27 at their heart. My own admiration for this, for the portrait of John Marin, and for scattered other pieces, has been strong enough to make me wish that the exhibition had never happened, since it madde me realize that for a couple of decades, when confronted by an individual sculpture or drawing beyond these, I have registered, “Not a very good Lachaise,” without having realized that there aren't very many good ones. It is not simply that Lachaise is repetitious in his obsessive theme of woman as a generic symbol of the life force. The theme has been a strong one for at least 20,000 years, and should maintain its validity until human beings can be started from scratch in incubators. The trouble is that in his obsession Lachaise did not realize that diminishing returns are involved in the idea that if a spectacularly endowed woman is immediately expressive of something, then a more spectacularly endowed one is even more expressive of it, and so on and on and on. In this, the dominant area of his work, Lachaise confused physical fact with abstract principle, and finally gave us only grotesque women instead of meaningful symbols. This turns inside out the whole business of what art is supposed to be. In the rest of his work, notably the conventionalized portraits and the figurines, Lachaise was a stylist in variations of a manner that, recently démodé, has taken on fashionable antiquarian interest when it reflects art nouveau and is treated with benevolent amusement when it is extended into the chic nine‐teen‐twenties. Scattered around elsewhere are some slick academic pieces that would not be given storage room in most museums without Lachaise's name attached. ∙ Still, there are a dozen pieces, all familiar, that, if gathered together and flatteringly displayed, would make you say, “Why don't they hold a big Lachaise show?” Alas, they did. Before coming to the Whitney, it played at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which organized it last year. Seemed an awfully good idea at the time.

648-> Ex‐F.B.I. Agent Calls Opening His Hardest Job; Head of Exposition's Police Stresses Keeping Peace; Supervised Investigation in Weinberger Kidnapping
John Joseph Manning has stalked murderers, kidnapers and bank robbers. He has organized dragnets and hunted forgers and jewel thieves. But yesterday was the hardest day of his life. The head of the World's Fair police and fire departments is a 56‐year‐old former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. During yesterday's demonstrations, he was reluctant to use the police powers at his disposal. He ordered the arrest only of demonstrators who turned to violence, or those who impeded the normal operation of the fair. Peaceful picketing was respected. “We respect the rights of those who respect the rights of others.” he said. A gregarious, muscular sixfooter, Mr. Manning has the title of executive official of the World's Fair Division of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, which he Joined in 1962. A native of Worcester, Mass., Mr. Manning was graduated from St. John's UUniversity wwith a business administration de‐ gree in 1930 and took graduate courses in statistics before becoming an agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. His most famous case was the kidnapping and murder of onemonth old Peter Weinberger, in 1956 in Westbury, L. I. “With the exception of the fair, it was the most painstaking, exasperating assignmment I've ever had,” he recalled. He supervised the study of more than a million signatures on State Motor Vehicle records. The investigation led to the arrest and conviction of Angelo John LaMarca, who later died in the electric ehair. Mr. Manning also helped solve the $75,000 robbery of the Floral Park, L. I., National Bank. Mr. Manning retired from the F.B.I. in 1962. Forty per cent of the male members of the fair's police department have had previous police experience, and many of them are veterans of the New York City Police Department. His recent round‐the‐clock duties, he said, have kept him away from the golf courses and out of the flower garden of his four‐bedroom Flushing home. Mr. Manning is an avid reader of biographies and history. In his dark blue suit and quiet necktie, he might be mistaken on the exposition grounds for a successful, small‐town businessman visiting the fair for a day. His subordinates, particularly veterans of many years of police work, are unreserved in their praise of Mr. Manning for his efficiency and fairness. “When you work for a man who knows what he's doing and how to do it you've got a goodjob,” said one of his supervising sergeants. Mr. Manning and his wife Edith have two sons, a daughter and a granddaughter. One son, Kenneth is on active navy duty in the Panama Canal Zone as an ensign. John, lieutenant in the Naval Reserve, is a projects engineers with Grumman Aircraft. His daughter, Stephanie, a psychologist, will be married in May to Peter Brian Maroney, who was a member of the Notre Dame track team.

651-> Sadair Wins Florida Juvenile Stakes
HALLANDALE, Fla., April 16 (AP)—Sadair scored a sixlength victory today in the $10,000‐added Florida Juvenile Championship stakes—a race for Florida‐bred 2‐yearolds. Sadair took the lead shortly after the break, shook off Dark Clover on the far turn and widened his margin the rest of the way to win eased up. Record Dash was second, a length in front of Dark Clover, with Winimac a length and a half farther back in fourth place. Windy Eye, the 8–5 favorite with the crowd of 11,129, tired in the drive and finished fifth. The winner, a son of Petare and owned by Mrs. Mary B. Hecht, ran five furlongs over a ‘good’ track in 0.58, twofifths of a second off Carry Back's track record. Sadair was ridden by Ray Broussard, who won the last three races on the card. Broussard, second leading rider at the meeting, also won with Ruppman ($14.60) in the seventh and with Pa Pitt (12.40) in the ninth.

652-> In The Nation; A Very Hot February in the Capital
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 — A rise in the temperature after Washington had been buried under ten inches of snow on Monday night and Tuesday is the tangible explanation for the record rapidity with which the snow has melted away. But the political thermometer of the capital is registering so high a degree that the clearance of the clogged streets might have been effected without the aid of meteorology. Three good examples of the intensity of this political heat have just been provided by the White House, some well‐informed press eommentators and the House of Representatives. The transmission agencies were: an extraordinary phrase in a speech President Johnson made to a group of Internal Revenue officials; private comments to the press by some officials of implacable bitterness toward President de Gaulle of France; and the passage of an equal rights bill that establishes a new, huge Federal bureaucracy with unparalleled and punitive powers over the commercial policies of private purveyors of goods and services. 1. President Johnson, after a review of world problems in which the United States is involved, calling them “distresses,” told his audiences that “from time to time you will hear alarmists and people who like to jump on their Government, people who like to criticize, people who find it quite impossible to be affirmative and constructive.” Having established as a unit this mixed category of citizens who “will join with some of our opponents,” he added: And they will be almost as much of a problem as some of our other [sic] “enemies.” The President has a modest preference for the use of “we” and “our” to avoid repetition of the personal pronoun, so that “our” in this instance may be a reference to himself in particular, or to his Administration in general. However, throughout his review of foreign affairs these plural terms were applied to the American nation itself. So the plain and deplorable implication of “our other enemies” in the context is either that the critics he was complaining about are “enemies” of the nation, like the militant world Communists, or are “enemies” of the President and his Administration. Roughing Up de Gaulle 2. Official resentment against President de Gaulle is of long standing. The conflict between United States foreign policies and his own grew sharper with his proposals for the neutralization of the states which formerly were French Indochina, under the guidance of France as the most experienced Western nation in that area. But when he directly spurned United States counsels by deciding to exchange diplomatic recognition with Communist China, and Nationalist China initiated the severance of diplomatic relations with France against the advice of Washington, the conflict came to fever pitch. This heat has pervaded some Washington press commentaries. In these, President de Gaulle has been found guilty of “open mendacity,” as giving the impression that he accepted no conditions from Peking on his grant of diplomatic recognition, and then proving its deliberate falsity by his “self‐abasement” in going back on the public assurances of a French “two‐China” policy that he had authorized French diplomats to make. Other charges in these commentaries are that de Gaulle left the Nationalists with no recourse other than to break off relations by “the shabbiest diplomatic initiative” of recent times; that he stands convicted of “double‐dealing” and exposed as having “caved in ignominiously under Chinese Communist pressure” in a “humiliating surrender.” It has been a long time since the political temperature of official Washington, of which these attacks are independent but accurate registers, has risen so high against the head of a nation bound to the United States in an alliance as close and as vital to Western defense as NATO. 3. The equal rights bill not only sets up great new Federal bureaucracies without historic parallel. The hot political pressures which produced it also hastily cast many of its provisions in a form which, when inspected in the cooler processes of the Senate, will disclose defects of draftsmanship opening the way to the worst administrative abuse. These alone will require fundamental revision in the interests of the very racial group whose most extreme demands are incorporated in the measure.

653-> President Advocates Fair Chance for All As He Hails Lincoln
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 President Johnson went to the Lincoln Memorial today to call for “a fair chance and equal opportunity, not for some but for all our people.”  14. Honoring Abraham Lincoln's Birthday, Mr. Johnson spoke briefly from the steps of the monument. He was accompanied by Sir Alec Douglas‐Home, Prime Minister of Britain, who arrived here today for an official visit. “We stand with Lincoln for union and for the freedom of all men,v Mr. Johnson said. “But the great task remaining before us is to fulfill the promise, to turn the words into actsacts of private citizens, acts of corporations and unions, acts of churches and voluntary groups of all kinds, acts of state and Federal agencies. acts of the President and acts of Congress.” The American promise, Mr. Johnson said, will be unfulfilled while children lack schools and teachers, men lack jobs and houses, and Americans go without adequate medical care or are “denied their full human rights.” “We have the means, through law and leadership, through prohibition of discrimination and promotion of new opportunity, through positive action on all levels of our national community,” he said. “We now need only the will.” Exhorting Americans to “take increased devotion to the cause” of freedom from the example of the Great Emancipator's life and death, he said, “Lincoln's words have become the common covenant of our public life. Let us now get on with his work.” Wreaths Laid at Statue Both the President and the Prime Minister laid wreaths at the foot of the massive statue of Lincoln that dominates the memorial building. Sir Alec placed one of yellow chrysanthemums; Mr. Johnson's was of red and white carnations. The President stood silently a moment, head bowed, in front of the statue and the inscription that reads: “In this temple as in the hearts of the people for who,m he saved the Union the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever.” Then a trumpeter piayea taps. Mr. Johnson and Sir Alec left the memorial, marching down its marble steps to the sprightly beat of the “The Yellow Rose of Texas,” played by an Air Force band. That was the President's campaign song in 1960, when he was running for Vice President. About a hundred spectators were shivering in brilliant sunlight as Mr. Johnson and the Prime Minister arrived shortly after noon. Snow covered the park surrounding the memorial and thin ice swirled in gleaming patterns on the reflecting pool that faces it.

656-> ‘FOURT OF JUNE’ OPENS IN LONDON; Benedictus Adapts His Novel Into a Stage Comedy
LONDON, Jan. 30 — David Fenedictus's novel “The Fourth of June” had something of a succès de scandale when it was published a couple of years ago. Eton College is one of the sacred cows of the British Establishment, and an attack on it by one of its own alumni was bound to raise some dust. Now he has turned it into a play, and if there is any dust raised this time it will be blown away in gales of laughter, for this is an extremely funny and well‐turned comedy, no matter how serious the underlying moral. The production, which opened at the St. Martin's Theater tonight, features Ronald Lacey and David Markham. The story is simple, and perhaps only to be fully relished by those who know something about the highly esoteric life of Eton. A boy from a poor home ‐‐what is known as a “Guinea pig”‐‐is summoned before the Library, a body of boys in auiority to be beaten for a bcch of rules. The beating unfortunately causes a nervous brakedown, and we then see the intrigue that is brought into being to save the boys responsible from the expulsion that the headmaster has decreed for them. Mr. Benedictus has peopled his play almost exclusively with grotesques, but all‐too‐recognizable grotestques and enormously amusing ones. There is the headmaster preaching the virtues of responsibility but shuffling out of it whenever he can; the bishop whose bluff parables teach only that boys should not give troubie to those in authority over them; a boy's mother who believes that making love to his housemaster will always get her son out of a difficulty. en there are the boys themselves, cynical, heartless and selfish, but bound by centuries o traition to act in accordance with custom. As an attack on Eton, or on the British public school system ir general, “The Fourth of June” is unlikely to bring down many casualties, but it is an excellently funny play and its author is clearly a worthwhile recruit to the theater.

657-> Rangers Cope With Rising Crime in U. S. Parks; Enforcement Being Stressed by Yosemite Officials; Greatest Cause of Concern Is Juvenile Misconduct
YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif., March 24—Crime is increasing in national parks close to population centers. Attention was focused on the problem last year in this majestic pleasure land. The Federal Bureau of Investigation handled the case of a young man who killed a 17‐year‐old girl. The problem has not been fully explored, but the National Park Service now recognizes that its policing tasks have grown. As do crowded parks elsewhere, Yosemite now has a law enforcement officer. His duties extend far beyond the usual run of traffic accidents. In addition, the Yosemite Park and Curry Company, which holds the concession for most of the community services here, hired a special agent in January to help with the police task, particularly the screening of employes who might have police records. A Park Service ranger, discussing the rise in minor and major crime in national parks, said the other day that the “crime rate in Yosemite is regarded as about comparable to a city of 30.000 population.” Rothwell P. Broyles, a 38year‐old assistant district valley ranger, acts as the “chief of police” for Yosemite. He observed recently that the accepted picture of a ranger as a “fellow to answer questions and direct people to where they want to go” had had to be en larged because of the situations such as now exist in Yosemite. The park rangers, he said, must now, more than ever, “command the respect of the public and continue to be friendly, efficient and a help to the people who want to enjoy our outdoors.” “We cannot permit some bums to make life miserable for families who come here to get the great experience of camping out or of seeing the beauty of nature,” he said. He conceded that the “bums” had been growing in number, probably because they believed that Yosemite and other parks were places of isolation where they could go to drink and carouse uninhibited. Last year 918 arrests were made in Yosemite. These were formal charges lodged before a United States Commissioner who is permanently assigned to the park. Most of the charges were for such misdemeanors as traffic violations, including speeding, reckless driving and parking, but they also included drunken driving and more serious crimes. The serious crimes included one murder, two rapes, two aggravated assaults and a larger number of thefts. Professionals have moved into the parks to “car clout,” or break into and rob visitors’ automobiles. These crimes have brought increased emphasis on a law‐enforcement training program for rangers. The greatest cause of concern is juveniles. Last year 314 juveniles were evicted from Yosemite alone for rowdyism and other misconduct. In many of these instances, liquor was found in their camps and cars. Rangers are being trained to handle riots, iust in case. The rangers have established close liaison with law enforcement agencies in counties and towns near the park. About 80 per cent of the visitors to Yosemite, which is open all year, come from California areas. During the height of the summer season, the rangers here patrol 24 hohrs a day. Four rangers are on duty all night. One ranger noted that the park had 30 men to cope with the problem while Merced, a gateway town to the park, had 32 policemen for a city of 20,000 population. The rangers carry no arms. They rely on persuasiveness.

659-> HARD FIGHT NOW FOR GOLDWATER; Recent Events Have Clouded His Prospects for Nomination
WASHINGTON. Jan. 4 —Barry Goldwater made official on Friday what most political observers have taken for granted for months—that he is the man to beat for the Republican Presidential nomination this year. But it is a different sort of challenge from what it was six weeks ago. There almost certainly will be more takers with more muscle than formerly seemed likely, and candidate Goldwater, himself, is confronted by a whole new set of conditions for the carrying out of his intentions. In other words, what had seemed only six weeks ago like a Goldwater waltz to the San Francisco convention next July now promises to be a lively scramble with such names as Rockefeller. Lodge, Nixon, Scranton, Stassen and maybe others figuring in the competition. But regardless of how crowded the field may become and how much the ground rules have been changed by the emergence of Lyndon Johnson as the Democratic target, Barry Goldwater still had a commanding lead for his party's nomination as he officially entered the race this week. He also has some new problems to solve if he means to stay ahead. When Governor Rockefeller's divorce and remarriage last year boomeranged against his political prospects, Senator Goldwater's stock immediately soared. It soared so fast and so high that it seemed unstoppable. He refused to concede—until this week—that he was a candidate. but few political insiders were misled. Last Nov. 3, an Associated Press poll of Republican state and county leaders around the country showed 85.1 per cent voting for him as the party's strongest candidate in 1964 against President Kennedy. An identical poll on Dec. 27 illustrates the impact on Mr. Goldwater's prospects of Mr. Kennedy's death and the succession of Mr. Johnson, His vote as the strongest Republican candidate was almost halved: it dropped to 44.2 per cent. Simultaneously, the name of Richard M. Nixon came strongly into the picture for the first time and also those of Ambassador (to South Vietnam) Henry Cabot Lodge and Governor Rockefeller. This falling off in the popularity polls is substantial but not shattering. The Goldwater lead over other actual and potential aspirants for the Republican nomination continues strong. He is still the frontrunner, and he has two other factors working strongly in his behalf. His standing with the party professionals, the men and women who constitute and control the convention delegations, is unmatched by any other Republican today. He earned their admiration and gratitude through more than four years of personal contact and fund raising as chairman of the Senate Campaign Committee. An official of the Draft Goldwater Committee said yesterday that at least 400 probable delegates to this year's. convention are already “committed” to Senator Goldwater. This estimate will be viewed with skepticism by many. But it is demonstrable that no other visible contender for the nomination has anything like the organization support presently available to Senator Goldwater. The other favorite factor is that the draft committee offers him a ready‐made personal campaign organization such as any other candidate will require months to build. The group has chairmen and at least a paper organization in 40 states, and viable organizations stretching out to the cities and counties in perhaps two‐thirds that number. The Washington headquarters has the names and addresses of approximately half a million voters who have signed’ GoIdwater petitions and has receivecl contributions of a dollar or more from most of them. “We are ready to turn the organization and its treasury over to Senator Goldwater whenever he says the word,” F. Clifton White, executive director of the committee, said recently. But there are minuses as well as plusses on the Senator's balance sheet. The most important has already been mentioned—that he faces a different kind, and probably a more difficult kind, of problem in assaying to challenge the Presidency of Lyndon Johnson instead of that of John Kennedy. He no longer has the field to himself as a candidate for the nomination. His talents and abilities soon must be displayed, not in single splendor, but in competition with other talented and able men. He has lacked up to now the avowed support of any truly commanding figure in his party —a professional of greit stature and esteem and of national rather than regional prominence. Former President Eisenhower has been noticeably aloof to the Goldwater boom while trying desperately to interest such dark horses as Pennsylvania's Gov. William W. Scranton and Ambassador Lodge to get into the race. Perhaps the most serious obstacle the Senator faces is the inecessity of fighting his way through state primary battles. This is a prospect he is known to dread. But in his statement of Friday he said that he now planned to enter at least four —j New Hampshire, Illinois, Oregon: and California — and possibly others. This not only will put his indifferent speaking technique on display, but it will also call for the testing of many of his controversial political views. At the least, he will have to face Governor Rockefeller in these primary contests. There is a strong possibility that he also. will have to face Governor Scranton, on whom the pressure to run is now most severe, and a lesser possibility that he may have to meet Mr. Nixon or Ambassador Lodge. These are all talented men. But Senator Goldwater faces less of a threat from their fo‐’ rensic ability and crowd appeal than from the harsh intellectual analysis to which they will subject him. Mr. Goldwater has staked out many of his political positions —on the income tax, on foreign aid, on the United Nations, on civil rights—in narrow, arbi‐trary and often ambiguous terms. He has put them on the record in countless speeches, hundreds of newspaper columns and two books that already have sold more than a million’ copies. They contain many inaccuracies and contradictions. They nevertheless have won him great esteem among the very conservative. But it has yet to be demonstrated that the Goldwater viewpoint can be made acceptable outside the conservative wing to the greater mass of moderates and liberals, or how well it will withstand the rough and tumble of debate by men like Mr. Rockefeller or Mr. Scranton. Whoever the Republican candidate is, he cannot hope to win an election without cutting deeply into the independent and disaffected Democratic vote. Any Republican candidate who wins those votes must appeal to a broad range of interests; offer something for everybody, and not just a lot to a few. As he stands today, at least, Barry Goldwater represents one segment of the electorate, not a broad consensus. Thus, he could fall victim to the same reasoning that twice denied Robert A. Taft the nomination—the fear that “he can't win.” While Senator Goldwater has great organizational strength in the Southern and Western reaches of Republicanism, he is weakest in the East, where real center of party power has always resided. Eastern Republicans are not only cold to his Presidential ambitions; they dread his winning the nomination. For this would endow him with party leadership whether or not he won the election, and would put the national party mechanism in the hands of conservatives and right wingers. This prospect hangs like a bleak pall of foreboding over many Republican leaders who have long strived to “modernize” the G.O.P. and broaden its base of popular support. The Goldwater boom threatens to undo all their labors. They, in turn, will try to undo Mr. Goldwater before he undoes them.

666-> Humm, Last of 127 to Tee Off, Takes Travis Medal With 74
GARDEN CITY, L. I., May 15—John Humm of the Rock­ville Links arrived in time to win the medal with a 74 as the 54th Walter J. Travis Memorial golf tournament opened today. On the way to the Garden City Golf Club course, Humm was stopped by a traffic offi­cer and received a summons for speeding. He was the last to tee off in the field of 127, but played one‐over‐par golf in this oldest invitation event of the metropolitan district. Humm, the winner in 1950 and 1951, led Charles Highley Jr. of Spring Lake, N. J., by a stroke in one of the keenest qualifying races ever held on this course. There have been few years in which scores of 79 were not low enough for berths. Six were close to Highley, a former Montclair Golf Club champion who preferred tennis to golf in his undergraduate days at Princeton. Joe McBride, erstwhile met­ropolitan and New Jersey ama­teur champion who won the Travis in 1949 and 1955, was among those at 76. So was 22­year‐old Fred Lazard 3d, a Hofstra junior; Jim Tingley of Nassau, last year's winner; Pete Bostwick Jr., recent Rich­ardson tournament victor, C. L. Stafford Jr., Winged Foot, and Paul Mulach, Southward Ho. Humm went one over par going out, but got important birdies at the 14th and 17th. His long‐bladed putter was never more effective than at the 18th, a water hole, where he stroked in a 12‐footer for a par 3. He had to chip from the grass at the back edge of the green but when he holed out it gave him a par 36 for the inward nine. Highley lost a chance for scoring honors with a 7 at the 17th, where he knocked his sec­ond shot over the fence and out of bounds. Then he three‐putted at the 18th. He was one under par for 16 holes. Jimmy Bostwick carded 13 straight pars but he, too, found trouble at the 17th. He charged himself with a penalty after a branch scraped the ball and moved it on the address. This led to a 7 and then he three­putted at the 18th.

667-> Celtics 108‐105 Victors
BOSTON, Jan. 19 (AP)—The Boston Celtics saw a 22‐point lead melt to a point, then got a rare long jump shot from Bill Russell and two free throws by Tommy Heinsohn to pull out a 108‐105 victory today over the San Francisco Warriors. Heinsohn led the National Basketball Association defending champions with 27 points. He helped Russell work against Wilt Chamberlain of the Warriors, who got 31 points and 30 rebounds. Boston, which had lost a big leadin the first half, outscored the Warriors, 18—4, early in the third quarter for a 78‐56 lead. San Francisco cut it to 102—101 with a little less than two minutes remaining. John Havlicek scored a field goal and Russell connected on his lunging shot to make it 106—101. Al Attles of the Warriors sank two free throws. Then Heinsohn grabbed the ball when Wayne Hightower missed a shot and made two free throws with 26 seconds left Chamberlain got the final 2 points uncontested.  G. F. P.  G. F. P.

669-> U.S. CURBING SALE OF LARD TO CUBA; Adds Item to License List as Deal Is Protested
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (AP)—The Commerce Department snapped a checkrein today on negotiations for sale of $2 milliion worth of American lard to the Cuban Government. The department added lard to the list of United States commodities that cannot be shipped to the Communist‐ruled island without a Government export license. Such an action was demanded yesterday by Senator Kenneth B. Keating, New York Republican, after word of the proposed deal became public. A Cuban purchasing mission was reported negotiating with United States companies for 20 million pounds of lard, to bedelivered to the mission in Canada because of the restrictions on United States shipping to Cuba. Lard, a scarce item on the island, is used by many Cubans as a spread‐like margarine in this country‐as well as for cooking. There has been no regulation against selling lard to Cuba. It was included on a long list of items that may be sold to that country under a general merchandise license. This type license does not require an application to the Commerce Department. The only countries for which licenses previously have been required for shipments of edible fats and oils have been Communist China, North Korea and North Vietnam. Today's announcement said: “Until further notice any export or transhipments of lard from the United States will require a validated license to be shipped to Cuba.”

670-> SOCIAL WORKERS STRIKE 6 AGENCIES; Action Affects Counseling and Care for Children
Employes of six agencies that counsel families and care for emotionally disturbed children began a strike yesterday for what they called salary increases and improvements in working conditions. The agencies, which have 1,031 employes, are the Altro Health and Rehabilitation Services, Inc.; Jewish Board of Guardians, Jewish Child Care Association of New York, Jewish Community Services of Long Island, Jewish Family Service and Louise Wise Services. All are affiliated with the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. At issue, according to the employes' union, Local 1707 of the Community and Social Agency Employes, are union security, improved grievance machinery, better wages and shorter hours. A spokesman for the six agencies said they felt they were “the victims of an internal fight for power within the union and that the real issues had little to do with wages, hours or working conditions.” He said salaries for inexperienced social workers began at $6,100 and for supervisory personnel at $8,020. As the union threw up picket lines at 40 offices and residential treatment centers in the Bronx and Westchester County, officials of the organizations announced that they had discontinued their family counseling service. It was estimated that 12,000 families would be affected. Of more immediate concern, a spokesman for the agencies said, are the 3,000 clients in residence—5 to 18 years of age —who are in need of daily care. These are disturbed children, disabled persons being rehabilitated and unmarried mothers. A thousand more children who report regularly for care have been informed that their treatment has been put off. Supervisory personnel are handling this work during the strike. A union official said that it had set up a professional practices committee to assist the agencies with these cases but that the managements “had not responded to this offer.” The agencies said that they anticipated no “unusual problems” with the daily care cases over the weekend and that on Monday they expected volunteer workers to help service the institutions. Plans also were being made to overcome other problems that will result from the strike. Pickets stopped a truck taking food to the Hawthorne School in Westchester for the lunch hour and persuaded the driver not to complete the delivery. Staff personnel arranged to bring food in by private autos. Under treatment at the school are 206 children with emotional problems.

671-> NEGROES' HOUSING PUSHED IN JERSEY; Quakers Coordinate Drive in the Northern Suburbs
SUMMIT, N. J., Jan. 4—A stepped‐up effort is under way to encourage Negroes to move into Northern New Jersey suburbs. More than 40 community “fair housing” groups‐20 of them organized within the last year—are compiling listings of available houses and seeking prospective Negro buyers. The campaign is being coordinated by the American Friends Service Committee, an agency of the Society of Friends, or Quakers. A central listing of available houses has been established by the committee and the Urban League of Essex County at the league's office in Newark. More than 125 houses presently are listed. They range in price from $20,000 to $35,000 and are situated throughout the northern New Jersey counties, especially in Bergen and Essex. The effort is being led by David Ludlow, an architect of Summit, who was designated by the New York metropolitan region of the Friends as its northern New Jersey “housing opportunities” representative. Speakers will appear before many Negro groups in the area urging their members to consider moving into white neighborhoods, Mr. Ludlow said today. The plan is to have Negroes who have made such a move relate their experiences. “A number of Negroes have been received cordially in white suburban communities here,” Mr. Ludlow declared, adding, “In some cases they have actually been embarrassed by the amount of hospitality.” He conceded, however, that finding Negroes willing to take such a step was difficult both because of the cost of homes and apprehensions of hostility. The New Jersey project is an outgrowth of the “fair housing” movement that mushroomed in the New York suburbs about two years ago, for the most part spontaneously and at the local level. Pledges to welcome Negroes as neighbors were extensively distributed by church and other groups, and in many communities efforts were made to list homes that were available for sale to Negroes. The New Jersey effort gained impetus when the Quaker group assumed a coordinating role last year.

672-> Snow Nor Cold Halts Mining, But Those ‘Ski Gals’ Might
PARK CITY, Utah, Feb. 15—Neither snow, nor cold, nor sleet, nor ice is slowing ore production here in the operating mines of Utah's oldest silver camp, “but those ski gals are liable to bring work to a shuddering stop anytime soon.” That's the considered opinion of mining men lining the bar in The Bucket, Tommy Matthews's popular spa in Park City. To foster employment in what was once Utah's busiest silverlead‐zinc district, the United Park City Mines Company recently utilized a $1.2 million Area Redevelopment Administration loan to construct a twoand‐one‐half‐mile long gondola lift, a chair lift and two J‐bar tows atop the snowy Wasatch peaks into which its mine shafts burrow. As a result, when the snows deepened just before Christmas, skiers including quite a few women began stemming and schussing past the shaft house and offices of the old Silver King Mine Company. “Eyes popped for a while, but now the whistling has stopped and mining is back to normal,” says Art Gray, an underground superintendent. S. K. Droubay, mining engineer who manages both the resort and mining operations of United Park City, believes he is the only mining man extant who scans the skies in hopes of heavier snowstorms. “We have about 100 men working underground in Park City and snow, or lack of it, don't bother them at all,” he says. “But plenty of snow means plenty of work for another 100 employes of our recreation division—and most of them running the lifts and gondolas are ex‐miners.” Elsewhere in the mountainous West, mining engineers look at snow and below‐zero temperatures less favorably, although modern machinery and proper lubricants keep open‐pit mines, as well as underground operations, running smoothly despite bitter weather. Near Ely, Nev., a perennial “icebox of the nation” where temperatures of 15 below zero are not uncommon, Kennecott Copper Corporation crews keep pretty close to the goal of 24,000 tons of ore and 80,000 tons of waste that must be moved from the Ruth open pit daily. According to Canadian‐born M. J. O'shaughnessy, heavy‐set, round‐faced, cheerful chief of Kennecott's Nevada operations, “Snow hasn't been too bad except for one big blizzard in January.” Traffic problems engendered when 500 men drive to the mine and another 500 drive to the reduction plant 20 miles away at McGill set off major headaches for all mine families. Keeping ore from freezing in railroad hopper cars and proper lubrication of the mine's 9cubic‐yard shovels and 65‐ton trucks are Mr. O'shaughnessy's operating problems, “but you meet them by preparing in advance,” he says. At Hailey, Idaho, not far from Sun Valley, Gavin Young, project manager at the Federal Resources Company's Silver Star‐Queen Mine echoes Mr. O'shaughnessy's motto, sadly adding, “You can have plenty of trouble with winter weather if you're not ready. That's why we spent our time mining snow a few weeks back.” Mr. Young explains that his men were building a new mill, but couldn't get the roof on before the first big storm hit. “You could ski down the ridge where the roof should have been. In fact, some of the men did,” Mr. Young says ruefully. The roof is on now, machinery is being installed and the mill will be operational in March. “But that was the first time I ever mined snow out of the inside of a building.” Far to the north, in Idaho's frigid Coeur d'Alene country, 62‐year‐old Lee Messerly, general mining superintendent for Federal Resources, is trying to prepare the Conjecture‐Star Mine for springtime oneration. “It gets a bit rough” he reports, “since we've got almost 20 miles of road to Bayview to keep open ourselves, and the snow is four or five feet deep.” His eight‐man crew manages without a telephone, “but we are real comfortable, with electric blower stoves giving us all the heat we need.” Mr. Messerly and his men are “kind of used to snow; after all, it started coming down in October.” They watch deer and elk rather than television and do some fishing in nearby Lake Ponderosa when the weather eases off. In Utah's old Tintic mining district, 40‐year‐old Gale Hansen, a “geologist who went wrong,” is the mining engineer in charge of a Kennecott effort to establish a new, productive silver‐lead‐zinc operation. Heading up a 46‐man crew, Mr. Hansen has headquarters six miles from Eureka in a windswept cluster of mine buildings 6,000 feet above sea level. “This is pretty easy compared with three winters I spent in the Andes,” Mr. Hansen says. “We have all the conveniences, television, stores in Eureka.” But he commutes 75 miles to Salt Lake City each weekend to be with his wife and children, and adds “trying to make a mine is never easy.” Mr. Hansen's development work includes sinking a 1,500foot deep shaft, constructing shops, compressor houses, assay office, hoists and related structures. “If you plan it, you can do it, and keep pretty much on schedule,” he believes. “Partly it's because of new materials. Nowadays you can use plastics and heaters and pour concrete even though we've got a foot of snow and zero weather.” Proper lubrication keeps bulldozers and snow‐removal gear operating, proper clothing makes outdoor work far easier than a decade or so ago. “Why, some of my people like the winter weather so much they drive over to Alta for some skiing on their day off, almost 70 miles,” Mr. Hansen says with a grin.

673-> SOLDIERS' DEATHS BARE CONGO PLOT; Effort to Kill Government Heads Nearly Succeeded
LEOPOLDVILLE. the Congo, Feb. 9—The story of a plot that barely missed destroying the civilian and military leadership of the Congo last Nov. 19 is just now coming out in detail, following the death before firing squads yesterday of six of the plotters. No more than 60 enlisted men in the Congolese Army seem to have been involved. Only a series of minor miscalculations kept them from slaying Maj. Gen. Joseph D. Mobutu, the commander, President Joseph Kasavubu, Victor Nendaka, chief of the Security Police, and Justin Bomboko, former Foreign Minister and now Minister of Justice in the Rasavubu Government. General Mobutu and Mr. Nendaka, in fact, were beaten, bound, and taken in jeeps to the edge of Livingstone Falls by the mutineers. They were saved when someone suggested that before they were thrown in the river they be interrogated about the death of Patrice Lumumba, the Congo's first premier, who was killed in Katanga three years ago. After the attempt failed, it was concealed by the Army command, and eclipsed by the expulsion next day of the Soviet Embassy staff, almost 100 persons, from Leopoldville. An account of the incident can now be pieced together from several sources. Earlier on Nov. 19 two Soviet diplomats had been dragged from their car and arrested on their return from Brazzaviile, across the Congo river. In the evening General Mobutu and Mr. Nendaka went to the military camp where the two Russians were being interrogated. The Congolese leaders were seized and beaten by a group of soldiers and driven out of town to a fishing village on the shore of the Congo. There the soldiers prepared to throw them into the rapids. Another group of soldiers was searching at the time for Mr. Bomboko. After putting up a roadblock near his home, the soldiers started looking for him in night clubs and restaurants. They sipped glasses of beer here and there. They abandoned the search after a merchant in whose home they sought Mr. Bomboko gave them some banknotes. A third group of soldiers set out to arrest President Kasavubu. Guards at his riverside residence next to the soldiers' camp turned them back. At the rapids, one of the soldiers suggested to his comrades that they question General Mobutu and Mr. Nendaka on the Lumumba murder. The conspirators dragged the general and his companion back to the jeeps and returned to the army camp. There the two prisoners were tied to chairs. At this point, an officer from another military camp arrived to check upon the identity of a captain who had signed orders for him to cooperate in arresting President Kasavubu. He found that a sergeant who led the group holding General Mobutu and Mr. Nendaka had issued the order. The sergeant fled. Without their leader his men got confused and frightened. General Mobutu, still tied to the chair, pointed out that his arrest was an act of treason. He and Mr. Nendaka were set free, and their captors were arrested in turn.

675-> U. S. Decides to Halt Movement Of Dependents to Guantanamo
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12—The Pentagon announced today that no more dependents of militarv men or civilians would be allowed to go to the Guantánamo Naval Base in Cuba. The wives and children of military and civilian personnel now living there will return home at the normal rate in the next two years as the personnel end their tours of duty. Assistant Defense Secretary Arthur Sylvester, who announced the plan, said there were about 3,000 dependents at the base. He said this number would be reduced by 800 during the next six months. Military personnel will be assigned hereafter to the base for one‐year tours instead of the usual two years. This will give the base, which is about 470 miles from Florida, the status of a hardship post comparable to Greenland and Antarctica. Up to now Guantánamo has been considered a desirable base assignment. Military sources indicated that some naval officials were displeased with the decision. In addition to naval personnel's disappointment in losing the right to take families to a favorite duty spot, military sources cited policy objections to the withdrawal of dependents. One source said the withdrawal might be regarded as a sign of United States timidity under pressure of the Cuban Government. It was pointed out that the United States had kept dependents in Berlin as an act of policy despite Soviet pressure. It was also recalled that Washington permitted a limited number of dependents to go to South Korea and South Vietnam. Mr. Sylvester said the decision on Guantánamo was “a further step in the process of making the naval base entirely self‐sufficient and to improve the garrison posture of the forces there.” Guantánamo is primarily an anchorage and recreation area in support of naval training maneuvers in the Caribbean. The permanent base personnel number about 3,300 military people, 2,500 military dependents, 650 United States civilians and dependents and 3,500 Cubans and others. When fleet ships are in, thousands of Navy officers and men use the base's facilities. The Assistant Secretary was asked how the withdrawal of dependents would improve the self‐sufficiency of the base, but he did not answer directly. Instead he emphasized the term “garrison posture.” Mr. Sylvester agreed with a suggestion that the reference to “garrison posture” implied an effort to achieve improved military readiness at the base. However, he gave no other indication that the United States expected trouble from the Cuban armed forces that ring the base. He said that no dependents would be withdrawn ahead of schedule and that there was no plan to augment the Marine Corps garrison. The Assistant Secretary said he was not aware of any Cuban military build‐up outside the base. He remarked that reports of such a build‐up emanating from Cuban refugees in Mexico were not necessarily true. Mr. Sylvester, emphasizing the improved military readiness at the base. said that the shortage of fresh water caused by the Cuban Government's cutoff last week was not a primary factor in the decision to withdraw dependents. He noted plans to bring water in by tanker and to build a plant at the base to desalt sea water. He said that a contract for such a‐ plant would be announced in a few days. “Several hundred” Cuban employes on the base have been dismissed, the Assistant Secretary said. This action followed President Johnson's orders of last week to cut off the flow of dollars from the base to the Cuban Government. The 2,500 Cubans who commute to the base must surrender to a Cuban bank the dollar wages they earn there. The bank gives the workers Cuban currency in exchange. Mr. Sylvester said he did not know how many Cubans would ultimately be dismissed. About 2,000 Cubans and other nonUnited States citizens have civil‐service status. The number of Cubans in this group could not be ascertained immediately. Studies are still going on regarding the jobs at the base. Mr. Sylvester said. He added that “a very close look will be taken” to determine whether the jobs that had been held by ousted Cubans could be eliminated entirely and to what extent other workers would have to be brought in. The State Department announced meanwhile that seven young crewmen of the four Cuban fishing boats that were seized in United States waters last week — the incident that set off the Guantánamo crisis —would be repatriated. The seven, all under 17 years of age, were exempted from prosecution by Florida authorities because of their age. A State Department spokesman said they were now at the immigration station at Opa‐Locka, Fla., pending arrangements for their return to Cuba. The Czechoslovak Embassy is responsible for their repatriation as representative of Cuban interests in the United States. The Czechs are also representing the 29 Cuban fishermen still in custody at the Monroe County jail in Key West.

676-> Nehru Deputy Declares Leader Must Drop Some of His Duties
NEW DELHI, Jan. 18—Gulzarilal Nanda, Home Minister, who has temporarily assumed the executive responsibilities of ailing Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, said today that Mr. Nehru could not “keep on his shoulders all the load he has had in the past.” Mr. Nanda said changes in the Cabinet could be expected soon, certainly before the Indian Parliament convenes Feb. 10. In response to questions by foreign correspondents, the Home Minister added that newspaper commentators and other observers were saying that Mr. Nehru's daughter, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, was the person “best fitted” to take over the foreign affairs portfolio. Mr. Nehru has always acted as his own Forengn Minister. Others, Mr. Nanda continued, were saying that Lal Bahadur Shastri, former Home Minister, should return to the Cabinet. The general belief is that Mr. Nanda favors Mrs. Gandhi as a candidate for political power but opposes Mr. Shastri If Mr. Shastri should come back into the Government he would undoubtedly supplant Mr. Nanda as acting Deputy Prime Minister during Mr. Nehru's incapacity. Mr. Nanda said his views would be “those of the Prime Minister,” who, he added, is assessing the situation and will reach a decision soon about Cabinet changes, Mr. Nehru's Congress party will accept the Prime Minister's decision without question, Mr. Nanda said. Mr. Shastri is generally regarded as the party's choice to act as Deputy Prime Minister, with or without the title. Asked for a realistic assessment of the Prime Minister's physical condition, Mr. Nanda said he had been seeing Mr. Nehru daily to report to him on current affairs. He said the Prime Minister was “showing keen interest in details” and “impatience to be up and about” Mr. Nanda said he felt that Mr. Nehru should continue to rest and that he could be more useful if he remained “for some time where he is.” Mr. Nehru was stricken with what is believed to have been a paralytic stroke on his left side Jan. 7 in Bubaneswar in eastern India, where the Congress party was holding a national convention. He was flown back to New Delhi last Sunday and has been confined since then to his residence, seeing no visitors except his closest advisers. Delhi opinion is that the Prime Minister's condition is grave and that he will be unable to resume his duties even partly, for some time. A medical bulletin issued to‐ night said that he was continuing to make “satisfactory progress” and that a special examination by Dr. J. D. S. Cameron of Edinburgh, in consultation with Mr. Nehru's regular physicians, Dr. K. L. Wig and Dr. S. B. Roy, had “confirmed the opinion previously expressed about the Prime Minister's condition.” A Government spokesman would not specify the “opinion previously expressed.”

677-> ARSON DEFENDANT FACES TAX CHARGE
Harold J. Getting, a private detective who is facing trial in the Bronx on arson charges, was arraigned yesterday on charges of evading state taxes. Mr. Getting surrendered to the District Attorney's office and was arraigned before Su­preme Court Justice Mitchell D. Schweizter. The four‐count tax indict­ment, which was handed up late Tuesday by a New York County grand jury, accused Mr. Getting of willfully failing to report nearly a quarter of a million dollars in personal and business income for the years 1960 and 1961. State tax officials said yes­terday that he owed the state “at least” $15,000 in taxes. Each of the four counts is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison or a $500 fine or both. The state usually starts civil action to recover unpaid taxes only after a criminal action is resolved. Mr. Getting was unable to fur­nish the bail of $1,500 set at the arraignment. Justice Schweitzer paroled him in the custody of his lawyer, O. John Rogge, and gave him until 2 P.M. today to post bond. The case was adjourned until Feb. 5, when Mr. Getting is ex­pected to plead to the charges. Mr. Getting runs the Miidtown Detective and Investigation Bu­reau, 115 West 42d Street. He gave his home address as 1561 York Avenue. Officials said yesterday that the first evidence against Mr. Getting in the tax case came to light in connection with the investigation of highway con­struction frauds by State At­torney General Louis J. Lefko­witz. Last July, Mr. Getting pleaded not guilty to a Bronx grand jury charge of setting fire in 1959 to the trailer office of a construction company on Bruck­ner Boulevard. That case is pending. .

679-> CHESS: MARSHALL CLUB FINALIST
THE participants in the finals of the 1964 Marshall Chess Club championship, which began Jan. 3, include four seeded masters—Louis Levy, Shelby Lyman, James Sherwin and Raymond Weinstein—plus eight players who qualified for the finals in the November‐December preliminaries, a Swiss system with 55 entries. Last year's titleholder, Dr. Karl Burger, did not defend. The qualifiers are David Daniels, Ben Greenwald, Sol Gruber, David Hall, Asa Hoffmann, John Pamiljens, Orest Popovych and Paul Robey. At this writing,the leaders are Levy, 4—0, Lyman, 4—1, and Sherwin, 3½—½ The following games are from the early rounds of this 12‐man round‐robin: In the Ruy Lopez, Daniels vs. Sherwin, the latter as Black maintains his strong squares QB4 and K4 with 11... N‐Q2. Thus, he places the onus of finding a constructive plan on White. White's 12 P‐Q5 locks the center as a prelude to action on the wings. After 14 ... N‐N2, Black looks to regroup his forces, although he is in no way compromised. White's 17 BxN, however, is the act that takes the position delicately off balance. The move,‐ in conjunction with 18 PxP, sets up a target in the queen bishop pawn. Attack and defense with caution is the order of play until 30 KR‐N1. Evidently, White overlooked the implications of Black's 29 ... Q‐Q2, which in‐ directly exposed the queen rook to attack. For now 30 ... N‐N6, cutting the communication for both rooks and simultaneously attacking the queen, places the rook in jeopardy. To offset the impending loss of material, White effects complications. In turn, this leads to an over‐all simplification, leaving Black with a winning passed pawn. In the Sicilian Defense, Hoffmann vs. Popovych, after 14 B‐B3, the opening has been completed with Hoffmann, White, enjoying a small but dangerous edge. Black's central pawns are under fire and his pieces, particularly his bishops, are not well developed. Black seems to counter effectively, nonetheless, with 17 P‐K4 and 18... P‐Q4. Soon, with 24 N‐B5, White has assumed a dominating post, and his sacrifice of the exchange by 25 RxN enables him to control all lines with rook, bishop and knight against the king and the ill‐posted queen. Black's theoretical plus in material is of no avail. But with 28 QxP, a step of sheer folly, White almost throws the game away. For 28...RxPch cannot be met by 29 KxR because 29 ... B‐B8ch would uncover an attack on the queen. Fortunately, White sidesteps the blow and still has enough left to prevail. In the English Opening, Levy vs. Weinstein, valuable time is lost by Black, who moves his king bishop three times during the first 11 moves. Hence, White develops a vigorous impetus with 17 B‐N5 as he completes the opening. Black dare not play 17 ... NxP because of 18 N‐K4, N‐R6; 19 Q‐B1, B‐N2; 20 R‐R1, etc. Middle‐game exchanges all favor White, who is able to penetrate with his rook to the seventh and eighth ranks as the end game approaches. Black's weaklings at QN2 and QB3, despite his two bishops, cannot adequately be defended. After the loss of his queen knight pawn, Black's defeat is inevitable. Too many irrelevant White moves mark the English Opening, Hall vs. Pamiljens. Timelosing, for example, is 12 B‐Rl. Better is 12 P‐Q3 at once. And 17 P‐N3 has no bearing at all on the situation. White's intention certainly is obscure here. With 17... P‐KB4, Black initiates a modest attack. White falters; otherwise he would not have been overwhelmed so quickly. Fatal to White is 20 NPxP. Why not, for example, 20 KPxP? Then if 20 ... PxQP; 21 Q‐Q3 holds. As the game goes, White falls apart after 20 ... Q‐N5ch.

681-> N.C.A.A. FENCING WILL BEGIN TODAY
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 19 — Forty‐one colleges from the East, Middle West, South, Southwest and Pacific Coast, a record entry, will compete in the 20th fencing championships of the National Collegiate Ath­letic Association starting to­morrow at Harvard. Beginning at 8 A.M., more than 2,000 bouts are scheduled to be fenced by Saturday after­noon. Individual champions in dpée, foil and saber will be es­tablished and the college making the best showing with the three weapons will be crowned team champion. There will be one representa­tive for each college with each weapon, as compared with three representatives at the Intercol­legiate Fencing Association of the Eastern College Athletic Conference competition at Navy last week. Columbia is the defending team champion, as it was at the Naval Academy. Navy wrested team honors from the Lions last week and Rutgers, City College and New York University shared the individual titles. Navy won the team cham­pionship in foil, tied with City in saber and was third in dpee. Rutgers won the dpde crown: Columbia, second in dpde, third in foil and fourth in saber, was the runner‐up to Navy for the three‐weapon trophy. The Lions are the Ivy League champions. Navy was the runner‐up to Columbia in the N.C.A.A. team championship last year with 50 points to the Lions’ 55. The Air Force Academy scored 47, New York University 46 and Prince­ton 42. The East is expected to dom­inate again. The Air Force, Il­linois—the Big Ten champion—and Wayne State are rated among the strongest teams from beyond the East. .

682-> NEGRO PUPILS FOILED AT LOUISIANA SCHOOL
NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 24 (AP)—Negroes tried today to enroll at one of the all‐white private schools where pupils receive state aid. It was the first attempt by Negroes to crack tne grant‐inaid system—Louisiana's lastditch effort to preserve school segregation. Officials at the school, the Ninth Ward Elementary School in New Orleans, turned away the Negroes. They said the head of the school was out. A. P. Tureaud Sr., chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Louisiana, said the Negroes would try again. The school is one of the private, segregated, nonsectarian schools established after the state set up a program of financial aid for children who did not want to attend desegregated public schools. Under the system, parents may enroIl their children in a private school and receive up to $2 a child for each school day from the state to defray tuition costs.

684-> Letters to The Times
TO THE EDITOR: There is no better place to begin the war on poverty than in the fields where migrants harvest the crops they cannot afford to btiy. Yet the Administration has turned its back on our seasonal farm workers in Florida, denying them even the pro­tection of a subsistence wage. [Edi­torial Feb. 18.] Since the passage of the Immigra­tion and Nationality Act of 1952 the United States Labor Department has been charged with the respon­sibility for insuring that the em­ployment of foreign workers will no.t adversely affect the wages and working conditions of domestic farm workers similarly employed. The Bureau of Employment Security, in carrying out this responsibility, de­termined in July, 1963, that a wage rate of less than 95 cents an hour would adversely affect domestic farm workers in the fruit and vege­table crops of Florida. Yet in October, yielding to strong pressure from Florida Senators and growers, the Labor Department sus­pended this modest rate. As a re­sult, thousands of seasonal workers were forced either to accept employ­ment at the substandard rate of 60 to 70 cents an hour, or to migrate northward in search of a better wage. Hardest hit have been Ne­groes, the major portion of the Southern farm labor force. Use of Foreign Workers Florida occupies a unique position in American agriculture. Although surrounded by areas of rural un­employment and underemployment, its grower associations have been permitted to employ an ever‐increas­ing number of foreign farm workers, primarily British West Indians. , The state has enjoyed an economic I growth rate virtually unparalleled elsewhere in the country. Never­theless, its average statewide farm wage rate has remained consistently lower than average hourly farm wages for the country. An even nlore marked contrast exists between farm wages for the l state as a whole and those paid by the major Florida users of foreign labor. While the statewide average ’ rose during the decade 1952‐62 from 67 to 85 cents an hour, wages of­fered by the largest employer of foreign labor rose from 55 cents to 65 cents an hour. And these are the wages tacitly approved by the Labor Department in yielding to pressure to suspend a wage rate established following a full public hearing at which growers had every opportu­nity to be heard. Suspension Extended Wide opposition to this suspension caused the Labor Department to hold a new series of hearings for the purpose of considering additional evidence. The suspension was to have been lifted on Feb. 15, and a’ new wage rate for employers of foreign .farm workers announced. But suspension was extended by La­bor Secretary Wirtz until April 15—the peak period of domestic seasonal employment in Florida. The Labor Department is clearly guilty of failure to discharge its re­sponsibility for protecting domestic farm workers against exploitation. In view of the present high rate of unemployment and underemploy­ment in the rural sections there is no justification for permitting grow­ers to import foreign workers. Nor is there ever any justifica­tion for depriving our farm work­, ers of the minimal protections which our Government can and should pro­, vide. Justice demands the immediate , lifting of the current suspension and the immediate establishment r and enforcement of a living wage tor farm workers in Florida. .

GREENWOOD, Miss., March 25 (AP)—Negroes queued up at the courthouse today in a “freedom day” drive to increase their voter registration in this Mississippi Delta city. There were no incidents or arrests. A biracial line of nearly a hundred persons, including several white ministers, slowly circled the courthouse during the day in support of those taking voter qualification tests, a prerequisite to voting in this state. Intermittent showers blurred signs carried by the marchers, who heeded police instructions that they walk at 30‐foot intervals. By the end of the day 35 Negroes had taken the test. Mrs. Martha Lamb, the circuit clerk, allowed them to take it three at a time. The test consists of oral questions on, the State and Federal Constitutions and multiplechoice written questions on citizenship and government. The registration drive was organized by the Council of Federated Organizations, an agency representing all major civil rights groups in Mississippi. Similar drives are planned for other towns.

691-> HUMBLE PLANNING RENTAL OF AUTOS; Unit of Jersey Standard Says It Will Experiment
The Humble Oil and Refining Company, main domestic subsidiary of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, announced yesterday that it would enter the car rental business as “an experiment” The company said it would provide standard and compact cars to 40 Esso service stations in Boston and Camden, N. J., as well as Allentown, Bethlehem and Easton, Pa. Rentals may be charged to the company's credit cards, or paid in cash, with no deposit required by a credit‐card customer. The cost of renting cars will be set by individual dealers. Humble will supply information on what the competition is charging. Humble expects to have an average of two rental cars per station. Cars are to be returned to the same stations from which they are rented. The experiment will begin between May 15 and June 15. On Monday, it was disclosed that the Kinney Service Corporation planned to extend its car rental services to the entire nation by using the service stations franchised by the Socony Mobil Oil Company. Talks between the two companies are now in progress. Kinney's rental operations are now confined to the Eastern seaboard. Trade sources indicated that renting cars through gasoline service stations was nothing new and has been standard industry practice for at least 25 years. Normally, the service station gets 10 per cent of the car rental revenues and involves no investment on the part of the station. Humble said its new enterprise would be directed at the “neighborhood car‐rental market” such as women, who may need a car for a few hours of shopping, or commuters, who drive in a car‐pool one day a week. The company said the neighborhood market had barely been touched by the growing car rental business. The car rental market has been expanding at a rapid rate in recent years. This year revenues are expected to reach $370 million compared with about $300 million in 1933. The number of rental cars has climbed to 105,000 from 92,000 a year ago. A typical charge for a standard car is $10 a day for a 24hour day and 10 cents a mile. This includes insurance, gasoline and free delivery and pick up in many areas. It also includes service within airports as well as rent‐here and leaveit‐there service. These rates have been challenged by some of the smaller rent‐a‐car concerns in recent years who offer cars for$5 a day and 5 cents a mile. These cars are generally compacts, and gasoline is not included. In many cases these cars must be picked up and delivered by the renter. The smaller rental car concerns have aimed their sales campaigns at the middle‐income, nonexpense‐account person or family, rather than the businessman who is the major car rental company's best customer.

692-> HUMBLE TO DROP TIDEWATER DEAL; Abandons Plan to Acquire West Coast Operations of Big Oil Company; $329 MILLION INVOLVED; Decision Is Termed Victory for Justice Department—Suit Is Dismissed
The Humble Oil and Refining Company has abandoned its efforts to acquire the western refining and marketing operations of the Tidewater Oil Company. The decision marks a major victory for the Department of Justice, which took action last month to block the $329 million transaction on the ground that it would tend to reduce competition in the oil industry on the West Coast. In a statement issued last night, Humble stated: “The long delay both companies would face as a result of the litigation started by the Justice Department, and the consequent uncertainties this delay would bring to the con‐duct of their respective busi nesses made it inadvisable to proceed.” Chief Domestic Affiliate Humble is the chief domestic affiliate of the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey). It is the nation's largest refiner and marketer of petroleum products. Tidewater is a leading refiner and marketer of petroleum products on the West Coast. The Humble‐Tidewater deal was announced last November. It provided for Humble to acquire Tidewater's West Coast refinery near San Francisco,: 3,900 service stations in seven Western states and five supertankers. Tidewater would have retained its crude‐oil production operations in the West and other parts of the country and also: its Eastern refining and marketing operations, including a large refinery in Delaware. The mammoth acquisition, the largest in the history of a Jersey Standard company, would have made Humble a major company in the West Coast oil market, an area in which it now has rather small representation. Share of Market Tidewater supplied about 7 per cent of the Western market in 1963, while Humble supplied only about 1 per cent. Companies with a larger representation than Tidewater in the region include the Standard Oil Company of California, the Socony Mobil Oil Company, the Union Oil Company of California, the Shell Oil Company and the Richfield Oil Corporation. In seeking to upset the Humble‐Tidewater deal, the Justice Department filed a suit in Los Angeles last month that also sought to make Humble divest itself of the Monterey Oil Comnpany, a California crude‐oil producer acquired in 1961, and to prevent any future acquisitions in the domestic oil industry by Jersey Standard. The suits against Humble, Jersey Standard and Tidewater were dismissed yesterday following the announcement by Humble that it has terminated its contract with Tidewater. The Justice Department suit had charged that the Monterey and Tidewater transaction would increase concentration in the production and sale of crude oil and in the manufacture and distribution of refined products; would eliminate Tidewater as a supplier of crude oil and refined products to competitors of Humble, and would eliminate Tidewater as a source of refined products to independent “rebranders,” gasoline dealers who sell at discount prices. An example of the length of such legal proceedings is the Justice Department's challenge to the acquisition of the Honolulu Oil Corporation by the Standard Oil Company (Indiana) and Tidewater in 1960. The Justice Dpartment tried to secure a temporary injunction against that acquisition before it went into effect, but was unsuccessful. After the acquisitipn had been completed, the department filed a new suit against Indiana Standard and Tidewater. The case is still in court with a final hearing scheduled for later this month. Four years after the deal was completed, Indiana Standard and Tidewater still do not know for sure that they will be able to keep the assets they purchased from Honolulu Oil. When the Humble‐Tidewater deal was announced last November, many oil industry observers regarded it as a corporate display of the adage “turnabout is fair play.” The observers noted that Humble's major expansion on the West Coast, an area in which the Standard Oil Company of California is the largest single marketer, reversed a situation that occurred a few years before, when California Standard moved into the Southeast, an important marketing area for Humble. California Standard made its move by acquiring, with the approval of the Government, the Standard Oil Company (Kentucky), a marketing concern that had purchased the major portion of its refined products from Humble. Deprived of access to the Southeast through its supply arrangement with Kentucky Standard, Humble promptly began to bulid up its own marketing organization in the states served by Kentucky Standard. Oil industry observers expect Humble to follow a similar course now in expanding its operations on the West Coast.

699-> Wrath Voiced in Chicago
CHICAGO, April 28—Hundreds of Chicagoans expressed their wrath to animal welfare agencies to day over President Johnson's pulling his beagles’ ears. Allen Glisch, manager of the Animal Welfare League, said the league had received more than 300 calls from angered citizens. “A number of them told me that, although they’re stanch Democrats, the President had lost their vote in November,” Mr. Glisch said. Will Judy, former editor and publisher of Dog World, disagreed with the view that dogs are not hurt by being lifted by their ears. He also noted that, while the President used the words “bark” and “yelp” interchangeably, they mean different things. He said, “A yelp is a cry of pain while a bark is a natural vocal expression.”

701-> LONG ISLAND BANKER IS STEPPING DOWN
The election of Sidney Friedman as chairman of the Meadow Brook National Bank, effective July 1, was announced yesterday. Mr. Friedman, now chairman of the executive committee, will exchange jobs with Augustus B. Weller, the bank's present chairman. Mr. Weller, who is 70 years old, was said by an associate to feel “he𢀙s entitled to a little less strenuous activity.” Mr. Friedman, who is 56, has been with the bank 27 years. Walter E. Van der Waag will continue as president and chief executive officer. Mr. Friedman and Mr. Weller, managed the 18 mergers that have helped the Meadow Brook to attain assets o nearly $840 million and 66 offices, most of them on Long Island. Sources close to the management described the job switch is aimed at “a little more firmness in the leadership.” They said Mr. Weller had contemplated giving up the chair for some time. The surprise election of two insurgent directors last January, which focused attention on the bank's performance, had nothing to do with the change, it was said.

703-> LADY SALVAGE DIES; AIDED L.I. CHARITIES
GLEN HEAD, L. I., Jan. 4—Lady Salvage, widow of Sir Samuel Agar Salvage, former chairman of the board and president of the American Viscose Corporation, died yesterday in her home on Simonson Road.

She belonged to the Piping Rock, River and Colony Clubs. She leaves 3 daughters, Mrs. John C. Wilmerding, Mrs. C. Champe Taliaferro and Mrs. S. Reed anthony; 12 grandchildren and 4 great‐grandchildren.

704-> LANDLORDS SCORE REPORT ON RENTS; ‘False Impression’ Found in Study on Controls
The city's largest organization of owners of rental property asserted yesterday that 1960 census data showed a gross vacancy rate of 5 per cent for apartments renting for $100 a month and “even below.” The group, the Metropolitan Fair Rent Committee, said that there was “no longer any basis for the continuation of rent control.” Under the law, rent decontrol is mandated whenever the vacancy rate for any class of apartments reaches 5 per cent or more. Last month the City Rent Administrator, Mrs. Hortense W. Gabel, recommended decontrol of apartments renting for $250 or more a month. However, she said that she was unable to submit a vacancy rate in support of decontrol at this figure because of statistical difficulties. The Fair Rent Committee said that its analysis of the same data used by Mrs. Gabel “compels the conclusion” that there was no further need of control. In support of this, the committee offered an analysis of the legal basis of rent controls and the wartime conditions in which they had their genesis; population, housing and income statistics; the experiences of other cities in which rent control has been abandoned, and portions of Mrs. Gabel's own report. The report was prepared by David W. Peck, former Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division, in Manhattan, and Prof. Ernest Fisher of Columbia, a prominent land economist. It will be presented at a public hearing on rent control to be held by the City Council today. Over 100 individuals and representatives of organizations are scheduled to testify at what is expected to be a turbulent session. The Council must find no later than Feb. 1 that a housing emergency exists, or all rent controls in the city will lapse on March 1. The report took Mrs. Gabel to task for offering figures that created a “grossly false impression,” and for citing benefits to the underprivileged and minority groups as a reason for continuing controls. The committee argued that such a finding should be based only on strict legal criteria—proof of a “war‐resulting emergency” that requires rent controls to protect persons from “unreasonable” rents. “In short,” the report said, “rent control cannot be justified as a relief measure. however justified relief may be.” If some classes of tenants need assistance, the report added, the responsibility belongs to the community, not just the city's landlords. If vacancy rates are to be used as a basis for rent decontrol the report said, they should be the “gross” rates that include dilapidated housing, seasonal apartments and apartments rented for future occupancy. The concept of the gross rate—not the smaller “net” rate—was in use when the rent law was first passed 20 years ago. About 175.000 apartments are in the $100‐or‐more category, for which a vacancy rate of 5 per cent was found. The committee, however, rejected vacancy rates as a basis for determining the need for controls. The rates today, it said, are not a reflection of the World War II housing emergency, but of the 20‐year operation of the rent law. In 1962, the report said, the gross vacancy rate for all apartments in the city was 3.54 per cent. The rates in the boroughs were: Bronx, 2.21; Brooklyn, 2.32; Manhattan, 4.67, and Queens, 4.91. For Staten Island the sample was too small. The report said that the overall vacancy rate was “considerably higher” than that of the seven other largest Eastern cities before they decontrolled rents. Chicago, Cleveland and Boston, which decontrolled in 1953, had vacancy rates of 1.6, 1.7 and 1.7 per cent in 1950, the report said. Detroit, which decontrolled in 1952, had a rate of 1.8 per cent in 1950. The report cited figures of the Bureau of Labor Statistics to show that while the rent index for New York rose 51 per cent since 1940, per capita income went up 237 per cent; food, 155 per cent; clothing, 112 per cent and construction, 269 per cent. The cost of all items in the consumer price index, the report said, went up 111 per cent.

705-> CHESTER H. GRAY, 84, OF THE FARM BUREAU
NEVADA, Mo., April 1 (AP) —Chester H. Gray, a founder of the American Farm Bureau Federation, died today in his sleep at the age of 84. Mr. Gray helped found the Missouri Farm Bureau Federation and was its first president in 1919. The state federation was a predecessor of the national unit. Mr. Gray, an early advocate of a nationwide highway system and proper road maintenance, was the author of numerous research papers on that subject and also on agriculture, taxation, forestry, and kindred subjects. He often testified before committees of Congress on these topics, and wrote articles for newspapers, particularly on the subject of highways. He was legislative representative in Washington of the American Farm Bureau Federation from 1925 to 1937. For the succeeding eight years he served as director of the National Highway Users Conference. Mr. Gray also was a former member of the executive committee of the National Airport Users Conference and a former trustee of the Library Research Conference.

707-> Text of Annual Report of Associated Press Directors
Your board of directors believes that the Associated Press is today in The healthiest condition in its history. Changes have been made in many areas within the last year to improve service and increase efficiency. Here are some of them: A major wire revision has provided a double trunk system connecting bureaus and newspapers which receive trunk wire service coast‐to‐coast. Special assignments of both editors and writers have provided greatly increased exclusive enterprise material. A new concept of photoediting and planning has been inaugurated with emphasis on enterprise. An A.P. book division has been established. The A.P.'s computer system ‐ still the only one in the news service field ‐ is now used for typesetting. A new system of accounting has been installed in consultation with and after study by Price, Waterhouse [& Co., accounting concern.] A direct teletype line was installed linking Moscow, London and New York. The report of the general manager, detailing operations and coverage of the news of 1963, has been mailed to all members ‐ and we hope you will read it. A good deal of emphasis was placed on technological advancements, but the management and the board are aware that it is still the cooperative structure of The Associated Press which accounts for some of the A.P.'s greatest successes. The Alaska earthquake is the most recent example. When the quake hit Anchorage it knocked out the office of our member The Anchorage Times ‐ no power, no water, no darkroom, no way of publishing for days. Yet the staff went right on working, mainly for The Associated Press. Managing Editor William Tobin and City Editor Bob Knox dug the A.P. wirephoto transmitter out of the ruins, lugged it two miles to the only communication lines available. And, with pictures The Times couldn't use itself for days, A.P. had a picture beat of more than three hours, transmitting 10 quake pictures before any opposition sent even one. Other Alaska members cooperated to the fullest, including station KENI at Anchorage, where the A.P. teletype was for days the main link to the outside world of the staff of 45 men who eventually covered the disaster. Publisher Bob Atwood of The Anchorage Times and Rene Cappon of The Anchorage News both contributed signed stories to the report. In the tragic sequence of events surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy, member cooperation was outstanding. Thanks to The Dallas Times‐Herald and The Dallas Morning News, the A.P. was the only service to carry both great action pictures of the shooting of President Kennedy's alleged assassin. A new venture for The Associated Press‐publication of a book based on a single major news event, turned out exceptionally well. “The Torch is Passed,” a word and picture history of the President's assassination, has already sold 3,612,000 copies. This is a tribute to a superb job done by the staff and also to the pulling power of member newspapers, since the book was and is being sold by many of them. Members at this meeting will be pleased to learn of the recognition that has been given to a young man who spoke to us here a year ago ‐ Malcolm Browne, then and now A.P.'s correspondent in Saigon. The Overseas Press Club of America voted his coverage of Vietnam the “best daily newspaper or wire service reporting from abroad” during 1963. Sigma Delta Chi gave Browne the top award in its foreign category and said “his authoritative accounts of the military and revolutionary activities in Vietnam during 1963 were in the best tradition of on‐the‐spot reporting.” In the world press photo contest at The Hague, Browne's famous picture of a burning monk was given the over‐all prize of the show, as well as first in the news section. This picture, along with Browne's coverage of the story of the burning monk, won other prizes in contests in the United States. For the second consecutive year, Horst Faas, A. P.'s daring photographer in Vietnam, was awarded a citation by the Overseas Press Club for his dramatic pictures of the revolt in Saigon and the continuing guerrilla war in the jungles and paddy fields against the Communist Vietcong. Browne and Faas, together with Peter Arnett of A. P.'s Saigon bureau, have been consistently outstanding in their coverage of the Vietnam story. Another well known A.P. picture of a police dog lunging at a Negro demonstrator, taken by staff photographer William Hudson, has just won top honors in the spot news category of the National Press Photographers Association. Despite mounting costs, the financial affairs of your organization are in good shape, thanks not only to the 1963 assessment increase, but to prudent, alert management. Total revenue in 1963 was $44,030,275, compared with $42,451,846 in 1962. Fixed assets purchased in 1963 totaled $533,721.21, all paid out of funds of the corporation. During the past year The Associated Press added 814 members and subscribers, newspaper and broadcast, in the United States and abroad. Nine more countries are now served by A. P.'s world services division. Growth in countries previously served has been particularly marked in Latin America. There A. P. added more news subscribers than in any single year since World War II. Shortly after the 1963 annual meeting, A. P. inaugurated a national Photofax network in Germany. It now embraces 37 German papers and five papers in the German‐speaking portion of Swit‐ zerland. Like overseas photo distribution generally, it is continuing to grow steadily. The most important single development in the foreign news field was inauguration of nationwide distribution of A. P. news In Spain, effective March 31, 1964. Under an agreement with the Spanish News Agency, A. P. news in the Spanish language reaches major Spanish newspapers on a special separate wire. A combined wire is used to distribute other international news service reports to the Spanish press. The Associated Press continues to utilize technological progress to solve the problems of distributing a modern news report. After 15 months operation of the dual computer system to tabulate and compose stock market tables for an ever growing list of members, the A. P will soon add a third computer. It will be used on the T. A. [nationwide automatic typesetting circuit] and sports ‐ wire trunks, automatically justifying copy as fast as it can be fed in. The third computer will also be able to serve other functions in other areas. A. P.'s broadcast membership department, recognizing that radio and television are placing greater emphasis every year on state and regional news, undertook a broad study of A. P.'s news production at those levels. The news report for broadcasters in every state was subjected to intense examination by task forces of newsmen who have specialized in producing news for radio and television. On the basis of their findings, out‐dated routine was eliminated, writing for broadcast use was improved, and regional news was packaged bette for fast use by stations. Broadcast members continued to increase their contributions to the A.P. news report. In some states the increase over the previous year exceeded 100 per cent. Two new reference booklets have been issued which are of general interest in the profession. One is “Picture TaIk,” an illustrated reported of discussions at a conference of photo editors from the largest A.P. bureaus in the United States. The other, “The Dangers of Libel,” is now being distributed to all A.P. news personnel and to managing editors of member newspapers. It was assembled by General News Editor Samuel G. Blackman in consultation with A.P. counsel. Looking ahead to the crush of news in 1964, we are confident that coverage of the political campaign and the November election will be provided with strict adherence to A.P. standards of nonpartisanship and fair play, but with no lack of hardhitting reporting and whatdoes‐it‐mean analysis. Machinery is being brought into play to speed election returns, for which A.P. has always been known as the basic, solid service. Coverage of social changes will have to be handled with the utmost care, as it was in 1963, when a special task force was formed to move into areas where the integration‐segregation story became especially complex. Adding to all this flood of news will be the Olympic Games in Tokyo. The sports staff is already having nightmares over one particular Saturday when it will have to contend with the Olympics, the World Series and the start of the college football season.

709-> Empty Palace Symbolizes the Revolt in Dahomey; New Government Shuns It; as a Reminder of Maga
COTONOU, Dahomey, April 27 — “And there,” said a taxi driver as he passed the glittering Presidential Palace, “is Maga's tomb.” Hubert Maga, the portly former President of this small West African republic, is now languishing under house arrest in a village 30 miles north of here, attended by a cook and a butler, and a chauffeur with no place to go. Today, six months after labor unions rioted and Dahomey's 800‐man army toppled Mr. Maga's regime, civilians are back in control. The army is out of sight. The unions are reasonably content and the newly elected Governmentof President Sourou Migan Apithy enjoys widespread respect for its integrity and drive in Dahomey, which until 1960 was part of French West Africa. Bariba tribesmen supporting Mr. Maga staged a revolt in March, however, which the French‐trained army quickly pu down. To most Dahomans, the palace symbolizes all the old charges of corruption against Mr. Maga and his party. It cost more than $3 million to build and boasts a gold balcony and a flag two stories high, which Mr. Maga proudly announced was bigger than the tricolor that hangsfrom the Arch of Triumph. “Corruption, low wages and high prices provoked the original discontent against the President,” said one French diplomat, “But it was the palace that brought him down.” It is vacant now. “Any politician who moved in would commit political suicide,” a trade unionist said. Most of Mr. Maga's ministers are in jail awaiting trial for corruption. Diplomats say the new Government has mounds of evidence of corruption, but probably few of the accused will be prosecuted. Pressed for the reason, a Dahoman civil servant said: “This is a small country. Most politicians—and that means anybody who is educated—know every other politician. Suppose we convict these ministers. It is entirely possible that someday they may be powers again. Who wants to rask a series of vendettas?” Most of the credit for the return to normality here goes to Gen. Christophe Soglo, now fondly called “the reluctant general.” It was General Soglo, then a colonel, who finally agreed to step in and dissolve the Maga Government after appeals from the civilian opposition leaders that only the army could restore order. A strong‐willed but soft spoken veteran of World War II and Indochina, he was repeated ly pressed by the civilians to become President himself. But he just as repeatedly declined. He is no politician, he said, and besides the army has no business trying to run the country. The general now divides his time between overseeing the expansion of the army to 1,200 men and building and renting apartments—most of them to the United States Embassy. There are few visible changes here since the revolution erupted late last October. PortoNovo has a reputation for being a hot humid, sleepy town where everything moves at half‐pace. Lazily circling overhead fans still stir the air in the old colonial‐style hotel on the seafront. The dozen traffic lights Mr. Maga installed “to give the city a metropolitan air” still seem out of place. No one can remember ever having encountered a traffic jam here, and hardly anyone drives over 20 miles an hour. But the new Government has youth and a fresh air of dedication. Businessmen like the bribe‐free atmosphere. Many of the top Government officials are young professionals only a few years out of French universities. Before the revolution they stood on the sidelines while Mr. Maga filled most responsible posts withmen they felt were “party hacks.” The new Government faces many problems. With about two million people, the country has an annual budget of only $25 million. When President Apithy took over, he complained that Mr. Maga had left the treasury with $26 million in debts.

713-> Texas Gulf Sulphur Plans New Venture
The Texas Gulf Sulphur Company said yesterday that it would spend about $45 million for equipment and an installation to mine and process phosphate rock in North Carolina, Claude O. Stephens, president, said the company planned to begin production in 1966, handling phosphate rock at an initial rate of three million tons a year. The company's plans to go ahead with open‐pit mining and the construction of a processing plant at Lee Creek along the Pamlico River follow the expenditure of about $3 million on a test mining program, which yielded 90,000 tons of phosphate ore. Exploratory operations over the last three years have indicated that the area near Aurora may contain one of the largest phosphate reserves in the world, as much as 10 billion tons, Texas Gulf said. Phosphate, one of the three basic chemical fertilizer materials, along with nitrogen and potash, is mined in this country chiefly in Florida. Other deposits are being worked in Tennesseee, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming and Montana. Mr. Stephens said the company considered the move into phosphate rock production as a logical step in its diversification program in the minerals industry. Texas Gulf's land holdings in the Aurora area of 50,000 acres are believed to contain some 1.5 billion tons of phosphate rock. The Texas Gulf president said his company expected to find its place in the growing market for phosphate, shipping to domestic and foreign consumers from its tidewater site on the Pamlico River, about 50 miles inland from the Atlantic Coast,

718-> W. R. GRACE OFFERS GASOLINE CATALYST
A new catalyst described as being able to increase the yield of high‐octane gasoline from petroleum by as much as 25 per cent with existing cracking units was announced yesterday by the Davison chemical division of W. R. Grace & Co. The company said the increase in yield in this country and Canada was potentially 235,000 barrels of gasoline a day. While its price is $800 a ton, compared with $315 to $355 a ton for catalysts now in use, the refiner is expected to bring savings that would more than compensate for the higher cost, the company said. A catalyst is a substance that assists in promoting a chemical reaction without itself being changed or becoming a component of the end product. Davison officials said the new catalyst was of silica‐alumina composition with a molecular sieve structure. Commercial quantities will be available on June 1.

719-> EMERGENCY CASES
TO THE EDITOR: The article dealing with children in hospitals was most in‐ teresting. However, it did not adequately cover a situation which I, as a mother, feel is important and have encountered. Many, if not most, young children brought to a hospital are there for an emergency. A tonsillectomy can be planned, the child can be psychologically prepared for it, the mother can insist on rooming in with her child; in short, conditions can be set up to suit the family. Not so in the case of the child brought in with a “hot” appendix, with croup that has reached the danger point, with pneumonia. These are just a few of the situations in which the child must be rushed—and left—at the hospital. Visiting hours are limited. Parents must, somehow, cope with the fact of dangerous illness and at the same time with the guilt feelings all parents have when they leave their children. No mention was made of the many situations in which the mother's presence in the hospital is undesirable. That could almost be an article in itself. “ is precisely in an emergency situation—when there has been no opportunity to prepare him for the experience—that it is most essential for a mother to stay with her child in the hospital and reassure him by her presence and attitude. This is especially true for the “underfives,” to whom verbal explanations mean little. A mother's presence in the hospital is always desirable from the point of view of the preschool child's welfare.”

720-> Stabbed Soviet Colonel Treated in U.S. Hospital
FRANKFURT, Germany, March 14 (UPI)—A high‐ranking member of the Soviet military mission to the United States Army was rushed to Frankfurt Army Hospital this week with serious stab wounds, it was learned today. A spokesman at United States Army European headquarters at Heidelberg that confirmed the Russian, a colonel, was treated for stab wounds at the 97th United States Army Hospital. The spokesman said any details would have to come fro mthe Soviet mission, and added that no Russian was in the hospital now. The Soviet mission refused information. The newspaper Nachtausgabe said the stabbing occurred Tuesday night in the Borheim section, far from Soviet mission headquarters. The Russian, in uniform, suffered eight stab wounds, the paper said. It added that on Thursday a Soviet specialist flew here from Moscow to help treat the Russian officer.

LAWRENCE, Kan., March 26 (UPI)—Dick Harp, Kansas University's basketball coach for the last eight years, resigned today, effective July 1. “I have determined it is time for me to retire from coaching,” Harp said. “My association with the University of Kansas has been a wonderful experience. Yet, it seems that careful consideration of all factors dicuates that I resign. My plans for the future are not definite at the moment.” Harp, 44 years old, had been connected with Kansas basketball 21 years as player and coach. He joined the staff as assistant to Dr. F. C. (Phog) Allen in 1949 after a two‐year stint as head coach at William Jewell of Liberty, Mo., and succeeded Allen in 1957. Harp's record for 10 seasons was 136―105, 116―82 at Kansas. He was only the fourth coach in Kansas University's 74‐year basketball history. He piloted Kansas to a Big Eight Conference championship and the National Collegiate final in his first season, and guided his 1960 edition to a share of the conference title.

723-> Spring Is in the Air, And Maybe now, Too
Spring officially arrived yesterday, and while it made no great impressionn on New Yorkers, at least it's straight ahead now and; downhill to summer. However, the Weather Bureau said last night there was a chance of rain and snow today. The sunny, almost cloudless skies were deceptive to those who looked out of their windows. The mean temperature for the day was 41 degrees, one below the normal ior March 20.The WeatherBUreau attributed the nip in the air to the low humidity—about 30 per cent most of the day. The high temperature yesterday was 52 degrees. At that, New Yorkerswere fortunate. Spring continued to wear the face ofwinterin the Midwest, wheresleet, freezing rain and snow caused the usual problems in parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado and Nebraska.

724-> Spotlight on New Hampshire
New Hampshire's primary always attracts enormous attention, not because it is intrinsically important but because it provides the first test of voter sentiment in every national election canipaign. This year, with the race for the Republican Presidential nomination turning into a scramble, the primary has been the focus of even more interest than usual. The state's Democrats, of course, have no doubt who their Presidential candidate will be. With Lyndon B. Johnson all but nominated, their spotlight is on the Vice‐Presidency. On the Republican side, precisely because so many candidates, almost‐candidates and could‐be‐candidates are under active consideration, the probability is strong that tomorrow's balloting will have clearer results in burying hopes than inadvancing them. As former Vice President Nixon, one of the almost‐candidates, put it the other day, what New Hampshire does may “more likely hurt whoever loses than help whoever wins.” The two candidates who have fought hardest for the primary designation—Governor Rockefeller and Senator Goldwater—have in the process done most to specify their positions on foreign and domestic affairs. This necessity has been disastrous for Mr. Goldwater. Some of his views on the United Nations, Cuba and the cold war have sounded like invitations to world suicide. His remarks on poverty, Social Security and other issues have been nearly as dismaying. Worst of all, whenever he gets past the level of Rotary Club slogans, the Senator involves himself in such contradiction and confusion that the thought of entrusting the country to his direction becomes appalling. Governor Rockefeller, despite occasional lapses into “get tough” demagogy on foreign policy and even more frequent recourse to mellifluous vapidity on economic problems, has generally maintained an independently liberal and rational approoch to national needs and the Government's responsibility for helping to meet them. In the New Hampshire primary—and solely in terms ofthe contest there at this early stage of the campaign—we consider him the best choice for the Republic an nomination. His qualifications and program are not only vastly superior to those of Senator Goldwater but are also deserving of support over those of the two other declared candidates, Senator Margaret Chase Smith and Harold E. Stassen. As forthe nonrunning runners—Mr. Nixon, Ambassador Lodge, Governor Scranton and all the dark horses still in the stable—we prefer to suspend judgment on their adequacy until they have formally declared themselves and been subjected tothe same intense scrutiny as the Granite State campaigners. Our endorsement of Mr. Rockefeller in New Hampshire does not imply any commitment to support him when the policies and personalities of all the potential Republican nominees have become better known. Nor does it prejudice our final choice as between the Democratic and Republican nominees when they are selected by the national conventions. It is a preference limited strictly to tomorrow's Republican primary in New Hampshire. Among that state's Democrats the real interest is confined to the suddenly organized write‐in campaign to make Attorney General Kennedy the Vice‐Presidential favorite. Mr. Kennedy's friends are hurting him by this device. The greater its success, the more embarrassing it will be for President Johnson—and, to that extent, the more it will defeat its own aim. The kindest service the Attorney General's admirers could do him would be to respect his stated desire to avoid any appearance of coercion on Mr. Johnson. It will be up to the President inthe end to indicate whom he wants as runningmate, and in this of all years he deserves to be free to the maximum possible extent of untoward political pressures in making his choice. The one yardstick that ought to determine the selection is the Vice President's fitness to carry the burdens of the Presidency if that necessity should arise. Write‐ins will not help make that determination.

727-> Questions in Des Moines
DES MOINES, Iowa, Feb. 29 —Many in this area question whether they really will have an increased income following the Federal tax cut. They think the state and counties may raise their taxes, thereby nullifying the reduction in withholding taxes. Mrs. Gladys Birkestrand, a beauty shop proprietor, was quite able to restrain her enthusiasm: “If there is anything left, I will apply it to my current bills, which seem to be rising monthly.” ‐ John Joyce is in charge of the Internal Revenue Service Investigation Bureau here for Iowa. His reaction: “It will be interesting to see how this reduction in withholding taxes comes out. I haven’t decided what I will do with any extra money I will receive from the reduction, but I’ll probably save it to pay the income tax again when it is increased. I believe the income tax will have to be increased again in order for our nation to pay its bills and carry on the various programs in which we are involved.” Paul Nessen, a Des Moines police lieutenant, is also taking it all in stride. He said: “The reduction will probably help me pay state income taxes. The way I see it, the Federal Government is going to give us back some of the withholing tax and the state will probably increase taxes. I don’t think my wife and myself will have enough savings to worry about.” The broad view is taken by Thomas Liquori, owner of a tavern here. He remarked: “I intend to spend any amount that I save in income taxes. I’ll spend it on my family for better living and in that way the money will get back into circulation. If we all do the same, I definitely think it will help the economy of the country—in fact, I know it is going to help in more employment and expansion of industry.”

The Assemblyman said that since his earlier announced decision to leave office “I have had a tremendous number 01 people and organizations urge me to reconsider my decision.” Mr. Hatch's wife, Marie, told the State Police on Feb. 17 that her husband had been away from home for 10 days. A short time later, Mr. Hatch called his wife from California and returned the following week to the Legislature.

730-> NEGRO CONVICTIONS VOIDED IN ALABAMA
MONTGOMERY, Ala., March 11 (AP)—The Alabama Court of Appeals has dismissed charges against four Negroes convicted of parading without a permit in downtown Birmingham. The court reversed the convictions yesterday and threw out the charges because, the opinion said, the evidence was not sufficient to bring the Negroes to trial again. However, the court said it was not necessary to go into the question of the constitutionality of the Birmingham city ordinance since the convictions had been set aside on other grounds. The Negroes — Ann Bentley, Charles O'Neal Ryce, Will Primm and Alfonso Smith—appeared in downtown Birming ham on June 16, 1962, wearing small cards bearing the words: “Three Went to Jail for Freedom. Was It Worth It?” They were arrested separately. They were fined $25 and costs each and sentenced to 30 days in jail when tried in city court. The jail sentences later were suspended. On an appeal to Circuit Court they again were convicted and fined $25 each with no jail term. The appeals court said the Negroes had not been engaged in a parade or demonstration within the meaning of the city ordinance.

731-> Workmen at Fair, Joining Opening Day Crowds, Find Their Handiwork Impressive; PROJECT IS SEEN IN PERSPECTIVE; Others, Still on Late Jobs, Pause to Watch Parade —Trucks Lead Band
The chances are that those visitors to the World's Fair yesterday who were impressed the most were really riot visitors at all. They were the workers who built it and opening day gave them a chance to stand back in the crowd and admire their handiwork. “You. know, before today,” one workman confided, “I hadn't seen anything but the inside of my own pavilion This is quite a fair.” He and others had worked right up to the opening. Another worker, riding one of the outdoor elevators to the top of the 226foot tower of the New York State Pavilion, said: “Boy, this is a lot better than riding on top of the car, hanging onto the cable. That's what we had to do while we were building it.” Still others found satisfaction standing in line for a buffetluncheon at the Schaefer Pavilion after months of lunchpail sandwiches and an occasional hot dog at the Brass Rail. In sonme casee, what the worknmen and other fair‐goers saw yesterday were other workers at work. But they, too, were more interested in thespectacle about them thann in putting down a brick path at the Morocco Pavilion, Or, cleaning up debris outside the Better Living Center. Some of the working workers just leaned on their shovels and brooms and watched the parade. Their hearts weren't in their work. This was opening day. A few even managed to get into the big parade, although it was more a matter of coincidence than intent. Just ahead of a marching band was a mechanical dirt digger and loader, and two trucks loaded with shrubs, trees and fertilizer. Construction did, however, continue at unfinished pavilions. Major construction was mostly out of sight of the fair‐goers, andthe worst a stroller had to contcnd with was the wielding of a broom or a wheelbarrow's bearing down on him. Heavy equipnunt had disappcared during the night and trees that had been horizontal on Tuesday were standing upright in their holes, some still wrapped inburlap. A few piles of unlaid sod and rolls of snow fencing still were in evidence. Most buildilng activity was behind the facades of more than a dozen unfinished pavilions in the international area. The Belgians' village was enclosed, but hammering could be heard ouitside and workmen could be seen atop scaffolds and rooftops. Outside the Sierra Leone Pavilion, worker s still were opening crates of exhibits and at the Guinea Pavilion two wooden briddges over an unfilled moat were being completed. The Better Living Center was the scene of bustling activity. By 11 A.M. workmen had cleared away some debris and had shielded some with a high fence. The doors were then opened, but visitors found only the penthouse restaurant and a couple of exhibits ready. There were naked plastic mannequins in the Charles of the Ritz exhibit and workmen in most others. Walt Disney was having electronic trouble with his Lincoln exhibit, which is delaying opening of the Illinois Pavilion. The Hollywood, U.S.A. Pavilion was open, but outside were a wet‐paint sign and a ladder. They weren't props.

732-> Chess: An Old Saw for the Novice Can Cut the Expert, Too
“ALWAYS check, it may be mate,” a phrase uttered with scorn and derision by the experts, may prove on occasion to be the soundest advice after all. In a simultaneous exhibition against 22 opponents by Grand Master Pal Benko at Fischer's Game Center, that situation came up in a Ruy Lopez against Miss Claire Sawyer. Had Benko moved hastily, he would have fallen victim to his own plot. The bizarre setting came early, after 7 Q‐N3. White attacked Black's king bishop pawn, which could not be defended without loss of material. Hence Black set a devious trap with 7... N‐R4, threatening queen and bishop. White responded correctly, 8 BxPch, and Black replied 8...K‐Q2. Here the obvious and apparently crushing 9 Q‐K6ch would have been rebuffed by 9... K‐B3. For all exits would have been blocked for the white queen under attack by Black's queen bishop. The queen would have fallen and only a semblance of attack would have remained. Thus, after 10 P‐Q5ch, K‐N3; 11 B‐K3ch, P‐B4; 12 PxP e.p.ch, K‐B2; 13 PxP, KxP, White would have expended his power. But after 8. .. K‐Q2, White won prettily by a check—another check. Benko won 20 and lost 2.

In most cases, Black's pawn phalanx is fundamentally sound and any attempt to crack it leads to rash assaults. One great merit of the deployment is that it affords plenty of scope for imagination by both players. This is illustrated in the following game from the Interscholastic Team Chess Tournament, under the direction of William Calibrese of Stuyvesant High School. William Jacobs of Sheepshead Bay H.S., White, opposed Miles Schlosberg of Lafayette H.S. The saving move was White's 19 B‐Q3, which sacrificed additional material. White forced a draw. He could have checkmated as follows: 21 QxKPch, K‐Q1; 22 Q‐Q6ch, K‐K1; 23 P‐K6, R‐Q1; 24 PxPch, RxP; 25 Q‐K6ch, K‐B1; 26 QxR mate.

733-> Negro Woman Slain In Jacksonville Riot
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 23—Sporadic racial rioting broke out today, resulting in the death of a mother of 11 and injuries to many persons. More than 200 Negroes were arrested as the police dispersed antisegregation demonstrators. Violence continued at night. It was the worst outbreak here since the racial riot in August, 1960. Mrs. Johnnie Mae Chappell, a Negro housewife, was killed by gunfire from a passing car at about 9 P.M. as she walked along a road on the city's nórthern outskirts. Authorities reported two other incidents of violence in the same area. A white man was found lashed to a tree. He had been slashed with a razor. Another man, identified as Carlos Gonzalez of Miami, was shot in the head. His condition was satisfactory. The man bound to the tree was identified as Billy James, a 25‐year‐old floor finisher. He was taken to Baptist Memorial hospital for treatment of wounds of the face, arms and body. A DuVal County deputy sheriff who heard Mr. James's cries for help found him lashed with ropes. His father, Roy James, who talked to …the victim at the hospital, said his son had told him that four Negro men had followed him from Jacksonville along a road toward his home in the community of Tiger Hole. He said he finally stopped and the men attacked him. He hit one and sought to flee, according to his father. The younger James said he had then lost consciousness, the father said. The men took $50 from the victim and a ring from his finger. A Negro and two white sailors told the police that when they had stopped their car for a traffic light, a Negro walked up, thrust a pistol through the window and fired several times. They were treated for minor injuries at a hospital and released. At least six other persons, all white, were injured seriously enough to require hospital treatment in earlier incidents. Some had been beaten by Negroes and others struck by bricks, rocks or bottles. An incendiary bomb caused a fire that heavily damaged the Ebony Record Shop, a whiteoperated establishment in a Negro area. There were reports of rock-throwing and minor vandalism in some areas. Several streets were sealed off by the police. State troopers sealed off all expressway exits leading into the city from Interstate Highway 95. Most of these thorough-fares pass through Negro residential areas, where motorists had been plagued by rocks. A number of false alarms of fire were turned in. However, some fires were reported. A police cruiser in a working‐class White neighborhood on the city's western edge reported that a store was on fire. The 430‐man police force of this northeastern Florida port city, including a riot‐trained emergency corps, appeared to have brought the outbreak largely under control three hours after it began at 9 A.M. Chief Luther A. Reynolds said two full watches of 100 men each were patroling the city with city firemen. Mayor Haydon Burns, a candidate for the Democrtic gubernatorial nomination, deputized the 450 firemen after a “get tough” announcement on television Saturday, in which he asserted that “illegal” demonstrations would not be tolerated. Many of those arrested were tried tonight in City Court on charges of unlawful assembly. Those convicted were sentenced to a $25 fine. Seven were sent to serve at the city prison farm. Negroes accused the police of kicking down the door of the local headquarters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and arresting the 35 persons there. “I wouldn’t be surprised,” said Chief Reynolds. He said a squad had gone to the association headquarters after reports that bottles and other missiles had been thrown from the windows at passing cars. The headquarters is in the heart of a Negro business district in which much of the trouble took place. The association has spearheaded the desegregation drive against restaurants, hotels, motels and theaters. However, its leaders have expressed disapproval of the activities of a small, hard‐core group of youths, who appeared to be leading today's demonstration. The trouble started when Negroes began massing at Hemming Park, in the downtown business district. The park was the focal point of the 1960 riot, in which whites, armed with axe handles, went through the district attacking Negroes at random. The crowd, estimated at more than 200, began walking toward the Negro housing projects. When it reached there, Mayor Burns issued a “disperse or arrest” order over the police radio. The crowd dispersed. But it later re‐formed and moved to a Negro junior high school. Several persons were arrested there. The crowd moved back to the park and two partol wagons and a bus was required to transport the prisoners to jail.

734-> Pope's Room Described
JERUSALEM (Jordanian sector), Jan. 2 (AP)—The Pope, in his two nights at the apostolic delegation in Jerusalem, will stay in a simply furnished room overlooking a small chicken house. A Vatican official described room today. It is on the second floor of the yellowish stone building, which is on a hillside about a mile from the citv's ancient wall. Franciscan nuns responsible for the housekeeping have repainted the walls light yellow and the ceiling grayish‐white. Inside the square room will be an iron bed, two chairs and two working tables. The room's only window, overlooking the sloping garden with the chicken house, has been fitted with double shutters. The nuns were told that the Pope liked risotta alla Milanese, a rice dish seryed in northern Italy and especially Milan, where the Pope served as archbishop before being elected to the pontificate. “Here we had another problem,” the source said. “The nuns did not know how to cook that speciality. We solved it in the simplest way, buying an Italian cook book.”

735-> Only 3 Oppose Hill Rise Today In Tune‐Up for Kentucky Derby
LEXINGTON, Ky., April 16 (AP)—El Peco Ranch's Hill Rise is looking for some stiff competition to sharpen him for the Kentucky Derby on May 2. However only three horses will challenge the Derby co‐favorite in the Forerunner Purse at Keeneland tomorrow. For the third time and the second in a row, the Forerunner will be a betless exhibition. Going against Hill Rise will be Mrs. Irene Karr's Cycloblond, Circle M Farm's In Accord and Louis L. Haggin 2d's Sam Lord. Cycloblond and In Accord have good records, but Sam Lord finished 7 1/2 lengths off the pace, completely outrun, in his only start. That was in a six‐furlong spurt on April 8. The Forerunner, at seven furlongs, has produced seven of the last 15 Derby winners. The victor here last year, Never Bend, finished second in the Derby, behind Chateaugay. Hill Rise was third in his first two starts last year, but has won six straight since then, earning $179,987. The West Coast star, who will be ridden by Willie Shoemaker, hasn't raced since his victory in the Santa Anita Derby seven weeks ago. The colt is a bit lazy in the earlymorning workouts. Cycloblond has been in the money in 11 of 24 starts. In Accord has won two of six starts this year, including a 13‐length victory at Keeneland.

736-> QUEEN ELIZABETH BEARS THIRD SON; Both Reported Well—Child Is Fourth in Family
LONDON, March 10—Queen Elizabeth II gave birth tonight to her third son and her fourth child at Buckingham Palace. A bulletin signed by five physicians said the Queen was “safely delivered of a son at 8:20 this evening” and that both were well. The weight of the infant was not given. The baby, whose name will probably not be known for several weeks, is the second child born to a reigning British sovereign since 1857. The first was Prince Andrew, the baby's 4year‐old brother. The baby is third in line to the throne, coming after Prince Charles, who is 15 years old, and Prince Andrew, but before the Queen's 13‐year‐old daughter, Princess Anne. The Queen is 37 and has reigned since 1952. News of the birth was given quickly on radio and television. Within minutes cars were slowly circling the statue of Queen Victoria in front of the palace and a small crowd collected on the sidewalk. People huddled in the cold, peering at the palace, which was dark except for tiny slits of light at curtained windows. Within minutes, however, a palace official came out and hung a notice of the birth on the railings. In the palace, Prince Philip, the Queen s husband, informed the staff and then telephoned Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret and the two older children, who are at boarding schools — Prince Charles at Gordonstoun in Scotland and Princess Anne at Benenden. The birth was the second royal birth this year. Princess Alexandra, the Queen's cousin, gave birth to a son Feb. 29, leap year day. Princess Margaret, the Queen's sister, is expecting her second child at the end of April, and the Duchess of Kent, Princess Alexandra's sister‐in‐law, her second, in May. Childbirth has become one of the most popular newspaper stories of the year. One of Prime Minister Sir Alec DouglasHome's three daughters, Mrs. James Wolfe‐Murray, is expecting a child this month. The baby will be one of the few infants ever to live at 10 Downing Street. The team of doctors, midwives and nurses who assisted at the delivery was led by Sir John Peel, who has been surgeon‐gynecologist to the Queen since 1961. He has attended at the births of all her children. The other physicians who signed the official notice were Vernon F. HaII, John M. Brudenell, Ronald Bodley Scott and Sir John Weir. The baby was placed in the cream‐colored iron cradle originally made for his mother. Later he wiii be transferred to the Moses Basket, which was the property of the late Queen Mary, the present Queen's grandmother. The birth will be greeted tomorrow with 41‐gun salutes in Hyde Park and the Tower of London. 21‐gun salutes on ships of the Royal Navy and a flight over the palace by the Royal Air Force. A decision will be made tomo: row about Prince Phillip's proposed visit to Athens, where he is scheduled to represent the Queen at the funeral of King Paul.

737-> Letters to The Times; Veto of Aid Loans Deplored

Unlike the aid given to developing countries directly by the Europeans, IDA money can be spent anywhere and a good part of it is bound to be spent in the United States. Every official or unofficial study of aid problems with which I am acquainted has cited the IDA as far and away the best means of giving effective financial assistance to the poor countries that can really use it. Unlike the United States Government, IDA does not have to, and does not, underwrite the wastrels and the troublemakers for reasons of political expediency. IDA has no politics. Let us hope these facts get the appreciation they deserve and that the House reverses its unwise and potentially very damaging action of Feb. 26.

739-> POPE VIEWS ROLE AS WORLD GUIDE; Tells Envoys of Pilgrimage —Johnson Visit Seen
ROME, Jan. 25—Pope Paul VI visualized his role today as a symbol of the aspirations of all mankind. In a speech to the heads of diplomatic missions accredited to the Holy See, the Pope said he had been persuaded by the response to his pilgrimage to the Holy Land that the head of the Roman Catholic Church represented “moral and spiritual values” toward which all men yearned. The Pope recalled that some of the most moving signs of respect and enthusiasm during his trip had been displayed by non‐Christians. His pilgrimage Jan. 4 to 6 took in Moslem Jordan and. Jewish Israel. For two weeks, Vatican sources have been suggesting that this speech by the Pope would be regarded as particularly important. It came at the close of Unity Week, an eightday period of prayer sponsored by Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox. After this morning's exchange of addresses between the Pope and the dean of the diplomatic corps, Baron Prosper Poswick of Belgium, more than one diplomat suggested that the Pope was assuming his new “world” role. One diplomat, an Italian with close contacts at the Holy See, said it was virtually certain that the Pope would go to India and would receive President Johnson in Rome, both before the year was out. The Pontiff has been invited to attend the International Eucharistic Congress at Bombay late in November. He has assured members of the Indian hierarchy that they can count on the closing of the third session of the Ecumenical Council in time to permit their attendance at the congress. A meeting between the Pope and the Presldent was suggested by Mr. Johnson in a message to the Pope delivered in Jerusalem by Sargent Shriver. Pope Paul replied that he would remain at the “ convenience” of President Johnson. The suggestion that such a meeting will take place in Rome —before the American election has been made by Italian and American sources. After Baron Poswick's greeting today, the Pope responded in French from his throne with the prelates of the Vatican Secretariat of State at his right. He declared that although he had already had opportunities to discuss his impressions of his “unforgettable journey, “he thought it proper to put them before the diplomats in an official setting. –Upon returning to Rome, the Pope said, he again felt “that universal fatherhood” expressed in the liturgy of his coronation as “rectorem mundi,” or “guide of the world.” But the leader of half a billion Catholics was careful to add that he did not mean this in the literal sense of the epoch in which it had originated. The reaction to his trip, he asserted, showed that despite historical and psychological changes, the mission of his office had a “ permanent character that breaches all frontiers to embrace humanity, and toward which that humanity, at certain special moments, aligns itself instinctively, as toward the pole of unity, of truth and of peace to which it aspires.” The Pope said he hoped his venture would not prove fruitless in the quest for the unity of all men. Then the Pope linked the question of human unity to the question of Christian unity. He referred to his meetings in Jerusalem with Patriarch Athenagoras I, spiritual leader of Eastern Orthodoxy, and to the “kiss of peace.” And he asked: “To be on the way, to have regained personal contact, after centuries of separation, isn't this already the start and the augury of developments that, God willing, may someday lead to the union so greatly desired?”

741-> Chester Asks Writ
CHESTER, Pa., April 24—The Chester school board asked the Delaware County Court today for an injunction barring civil rights demonstrations when public schools reopen here next week. The schools, which have 11.000 pupils, have been closed since Wednesday because of a monthlong series of demonstrations protesting alleged de facto segregation. The protests sponsored by the Chester branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Chester Committee for Freedom Now resulted in injuries to 13 Persons and more than 200 arrests this week. At police court hearings here this afternoon, 74 of the prisoners were held in $1,000 bail, fined $350 and assessed costs of $18 each. The same penalties were imposed on 38 others yesterday. At Media, where the school district filed its suit for an injunction, two judges alternated at a 2½‐hour hearing for 79 juveniles‐28 girls and 51 boys—picked up during Wednesday night's demonstration. Judges Francis J. Catania and Thomas A. Curran released 59 to their parents on payment of $10 costs. Nineteen were released after payment of $22.50 costs. Nine others were sent to a juvenile center for 30 to 60 days and one boy, charged with carrying' a concealed deadly weapon, was sent to the state industrial school for an indefinite term. In another development, the Federal Bureau of Investigation started an investigation into the arrest of two reporters of The Philadelphia Bulletin and the alleged beating of one of them by Chester policemen. One of the reporters, Timothy Tyler, a 23‐year‐old graduate of Harvard, suffered a broken nose.

742-> Popping Windows Plague Skyscraper Tenants; Gusts Pull Out 17 at Chase Manhattan Building; Tests Show a Suction Like a Cyclone in High Wind
It was balmy and not very windy in downtown Manhattan yesterday, so the people who work in the shiny new Chase Manhattan Bank building relaxed and went calmly about their busmess. When the wind blows, they get nervous. And no wonder. It's disconcerting to know that a window can disappear, just like that, quicker than you can type “yours truly” at the bottom of a letter. In the three years since the 60‐story tower was opened, 17 windows have been sucked right off its aluminum‐andglass skin by high winds. It happened last only three weeks ago, when the city was bruised by a 65‐mile‐an‐hour gale. The latest episode involved two seven‐foot‐tall panes, both of which fell 19 floors before shattering on the concrete below. It came as something of a shock to the bank officials who thought they had the problem solved. Not a single window had been lost to the winds in 1963—a remarkable improvement over 1962, when 15 popped from their frames. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the firm that designed the $130 million structure, undertook an elaborate series of tests shortly after the tenants moved in. Architects, meteorologists and aeronautical engineers set out to solve the mystery. They even built a scale model of the building and put it in a wind tunnel. At length, they decided that strong winds tended to create “negative pressure,” or suction, around the building. The windows were yielding to the same sort of force that lifts roofs off barns when a cyclone passes over. The building occupies almost the entire block bounded by Liberty, William, Pine and Nassau Streets. It sits in the middle of an open plaza, surrounded by other structures. When a strong wind blows from certain directions, particularly from the north, it tends to get trapped and to swirl around the building in the middle. Some of the windows that gave way in 1962 were found to have minute weaknesses. So each of the 8,800 panes in the building were examined, and any that had similar faults were replaced with heavier glass. A bank spokesman said the window‐replacing program, involving the use of glass in some cases twice as strong as the original, called for a “substantial number” of substitutions. “Expense is a minor consideration,” one bank official said yesterday. “No one has been hit by one of those things. They've all fallen from the south side into the plaza, which has just been opened. But we don't want to take any chances.” According to Chase Manhattan folklore, one of the windows that popped out did so not more than a foot or so from a secretary. When she looked up from her typewriter, all the papers on her desk had been sucked out with the window. “It's a good story,” a public relations man insisted, “but it's not true.” A lawyer who works in the building had another complaint. “My windows stay in,” he said, “but they leak. So every time it rains, I have to move my desk away from the window. You'd think this place was designed by a negligence lawyer:”

744-> Letters to The Times; For Control of Pesticides
TO THE EDITOR: On March 22 you published a report headed “Poisons Kill Fish in the Mississippi.“ [Editorial, March 29] What Rachel Carson explained in her book “Silent Spring” has come to pass. Last year Congressional hearings ventilated this question with the promise that the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration should work out rules concerning the use of pesticides. However, silence on this important and dangerous question has ruled ever since. Progressive poisoning of our food supply and a galaxy of slowly developing health hazards are obvious. In many sections of our country fishermen are losing their livelihood. Hard ruIes and regulations for the use of pesticides are needed without further delay. The Administration should give this matter top priority.

746-> Putnam Is Accused Of Attempt to Raid City Water Supply
A city official said yesterday that Putnam County was attempting an “absolute raid” on New York City's water supply. Armand D'Angelo, Commissioner of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity, said that Putnam was seeking through a bill before the Legislature to have the state force the city to increase Putnam's water supply by two million gallons a day. Mr. D'Angelo made his statements at a luncheon meeting at the Advertising Club of New York, 23 Park Avenue. He said the Putnam demand was intended to benefit “a single commercial enterprise” — the Ruppert Brewery, which is being relocated from New York City to the town of Carme1, in Putnam County. Putnam now receives over a quarter of a million gallons of water a day under a contract with the city. Mr. D'Angelo explained that the city now supplies 72 upstate communities with water from its Catskill and Croton reservoir systems at a rate of 150 gallons a person a day. He said the Putnam bill was “unconscionable” since there was a sufficient supply of water upstate to meet the demands of commercial users. “This kind of thing is unfair to the taxpayers of our city. I don't think the State Legislature should entertain any legislation which will benefit any single commercial enterprise,” he said.

747-> London Council Acts to Ban Smoking in Movie Houses
LONDON, May 5—The London County Council took a preliminary step today to ban smoking in the 154 cinemas it licenses. It accepted, 77 to 37, a motion saying that smoking was injurious to health. Before the ban can be implemented, the council will have to hold discussions with the Home Office, cinema managements and the fire department. A member of the council said the fire department was against such a ban because it thought this would encourage surreptitious smoking. An amendment to the motion for a referendum of moviegoers on whether they wanted such a ban was defeated.

748-> Chess:; Valvo Gives Scarlet Knights A Good Chance in the Finals
WITH the acquisition of the talented Mike Valvo, the Scarlet Knights of New Jersey must prove a good bet to wind up in a high spot in the final standings of the Metropolitan Chess League. In a recent league game, Valvo, as Black in a King's Indian Defense, defeated the experienced campaigner Bernard Hill of the London Terrace Club. The contest was pertinent theoretically because, according to Valvo, it seems to refute a line advocated for White by analysts. Significant was 9 B‐Q2, to preserve the two bishops for White. If 9 B‐Q4, P‐QB4; 10 PxP e.p., PxP; 11 P‐B4. The approved line was 9 B‐Q2. Valvo, however, stated that 9... N‐R4 refutes the variation. A salient point in the sequence was the possibility of 10 P‐KR3. This would have been met by 10 ... N‐R3, followed by ... P‐KB4 or ... P‐K4. If White tried, instead, 10 B‐K2, then 10 ... P‐K4; 11 BxN, Q‐R5ch, maintaining the two bishops for Black would do. Later, the obvious 12 P‐QN3 would be rebuffed by 12 . . . Q‐R5ch; 13 P‐N3, NxNP; 14 NxN, NxRP; 15 RxN, QxNch; 16 R‐B2, BxN, etc. If White played 14 P‐N4, then 14 .. N‐Q2, and the other knight would be immune on account of the queen check at KR5. Our comments are based on Valvo's notes to the game. KING'S INDIAN DEFENSE Hill Valvii Hill Valvo White Black White Black 1 P‐Q4 N‐KB3 11 P×P e.p.

As White, Valvo played the apparently time‐losing 6 QR5ch. This is one of the artful dodges of the more experienced player who seeks to create weaknesses in his opponent's camp. Technically, too, the move was correct. As the game went, Black was forced to castle on the king side, where his dark squares were vulnerable. Black's king was soon assaulted by 11 P‐KR4. Retiring his king bishop to its original square hardly remedied the situation for Black. After 15 Q‐N3, K‐N2, with Black's queen‐side pieces inoperative, the end was foreshadowed.

751-> European Styles to Give Tall Girls Here a Break
HE tall girl, in theory the fashion designer's delight, in practice often faces a slew of troubles when she sets out to buy clothes. Hemlines hover above her knees, waistlines hug her rib‐cage, and sleeves fall far short of her wrists. Preoccupied with finding the proper fit, especially at modest prices, she often has to forget about fashion. Her problem will be eased this fall, according to George T. Palley, president of the Over Five Seven Division of Lane Bryant for 15 years. He recently returned from a European buying trip in which he attempted to develop the proper amalgam of fashion and fit for the tall girl. He left orders for approximately $750,000 worth of fashion merchandise with about 100 manufacturers in France, Spain, Austria, Italy, Britain and Ireland, many of whose original concepts of styles for tall girls were embryonic. This is the fourth year that he has sought tall fashions abroad for the 62 Lane Bryant stores throughout the country, plus three Over Five Seven specialty shops and 11 branches of the Newman Benton chain in the Middle West, all Lane Bryant subsidiaries. The first three years were devoted to seeking out European manufacturers and educating them the intricacies of tall sizing, according to Mr. Palley. “They were often mystified’ at our requirements,” he recalled recently. “They considered a measurement of 43 inches from the back of the neck to the hem long enough; we insist on at least 46 inches.” The manufacturers have been sufficiently indoctr#nated to warrant the placement of orders more than doubling those of last year, he added. The average tall customer is 5 feet 10 ½ inches in her stocking feet, Lane Bryant has found. To determine the right proportions, about 10,000 women have been measured in the last 15 years, Mr. Palley estimated. Not only must sleeve, waist and skirt lengths be adjusted for the taller figure, but greater width across the shoulders, smaller bust measurements and broader hips must be considered. In addition, details like the flare of a collaror the depth of a yoke must be scaled to the proportions. First samples, now arriving from abroad, are carefully checked to make sure the size specifications are met. “Dresses arrive with the skirt the right length but the sleeves too short,” he said. “Sometimes the manufacturer gets so confused the hem is four inches too long, even for a tall girl.” Evaluating the foreign markets, Mr. Palley said that an Italian or French label had the greatest fashion appeal to the consumer, that Switzerland and Austria offered some excellent values, and that Ireland was coming up strong. “We can afford to sell a coat made in Ireland of hand‐woven tweed, inscribed with the name of the weaver, for $50,” he added. The aim of his European trips is to secure fashions not yet available through American sources, he explained. Very often, the distinction lies in the fabric or the weave. Some of the most impressive styles are knitted, and knitwear also constitutes a considerable portion of the orders. Purchases include a wide selection of bulky wool sweaters in new loopy textures and new patterns to sell from $10.95 to $13.95. Knitted dresses include onepiece styles with contrasting turtle‐neck yokes and bibs as well as two‐piece styles with suede or crochet panels at the front of the jacket. There are tweed suits with matching sleeveless tops, and a good‐looking knit suit with blazer jacket and pleated skirt. A double‐breasted nubby black wool coat from Switzerland has a Chanel look with its silk‐faced collar, pocket flaps and cuffs. The bulk of the coat and suit prices are well under $100; dresses are mostly under $50. Sizes covered are 10 to 24. The fall merchandise will be available in July.

752-> RUSSELL DEMANDS STUDY OF PROTEST; Cites Account of ‘Beating’ of Demonstrators Here
WASHINGTON. April 22 (UPI) — Senator Richard B. Russell, Democrat of Georgia, demanded today that the Civil Rights Commission and other Federal agencies investigate the treatment of demonstrators who had stopped a subway train going to the New York World's Fair. On the Senate floor he read from a news account of the demonstration, stressing its assertion that the demonstrators had been removed to a police station with their heads and faces bloody. “I demand that the Civil Rights Commission pull some of its army of investigators, agents, advocates and crusaders out of Southern states” to investigate, Senator Russell said. He said that individuals were apparently “beaten and bloodied” for what he called a “minor offense” of pulling the subway emergency cord. The Senator described himself us a “states righter” who favors having each state control its own affairs. He said, however, that it is time Federal agencies took a look at affairs in New York. Senator Russell, the strategy chief for southern Senators opposing the civil rights bill, said the Justice Department should also investigate whether At‐ torney General Robert F. Kennedy has any “instinct of fairness” in civil rights enforcement. Senator James O. Eastland, Democrat of Mississippi, another outspoken opponent of the civil rights bill, commented that newspapers would be charging police brutality if the incident described by Senator Russell had occurred in a Southern state.

753-> EVIDENCE DISPUTED
TO THE EDITOR: Leonard Robinson's article “We Have More Than Five Senses” (March 15) was, in my opinion, marred by a premature, uncritical acceptance of recent findings by the Russians and by Richard P. Youtz, Barnard College psychologist, of evidence that some persons can “see” with their fingertips. Dozens of similar cases have been reported during the past century. In every case, careful follow‐up tests disclosed that subjects were obtaining information by methods well known to conjurors and mentalists, but not to psychologists. The East Indian magician Kuda Bux, for example, has for decades been performing an “eyeless vision” act under test conditions far more stringent than those imposed by Dr. Youtz. The Russian tests of Rosa Kulenshova have not yet been reported in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of controls, but popularly written articles in U.S.S.R. and other Russian magazines strongly indicate that the Russian psychologists made no attempt to close even the most obvious loopholes. This is not to suggest that research on eyeless vision is absurd or should not be undertaken. But the public, especially the blind, are seriously misled when a popular article suggests there is a “very strong possibility” that some people may learn to read print with their fingertips. It is a very possibility. So far there is nothing in either the Barnard College or Russian reports that adds to the flimsy evidence derived from earlier tests of individuals who claimed similar powers.

754-> Russian Hails Capitalist Phone Habits
MOSCOW, March 31—Giant American corporations have been held up in Izvestia, the Soviet Government's newspaper, as models of scientific management techniques—from polite telephone answering habits to time and motion studies. A former university professor who recently returned to the Soviet Union after 30 years residence in the United States wrote that these techniques, combined with Soviet economic planning, could open “colossal possibilities undreamt of in the United States.” Prof. Vladimir I. Tereschenko thus joined in the favorite pastime of Soviet planners, begun last February when Premier Khrushchev called again for close study of scientific achievements in capitalist countries. A substantial part of Professor Tereschenko's half‐page article in the six‐page issue of Izvestia was devoted to Soviet telephone habits, which must have come as a shock to a repatriate used to the dulcet voices of United States switchboard operators. Professor Tereschenko, who in addition to teaching also worked as a management consultant, pictured a typical Soviet telephone conversation as follows: “Suppose you call an office and say, ‘I'd like to talk with Comrade Ivanov.’ ‘He's not around,’ a girl answers and hangs up. “You wonder, what does she mean ‘not around?’ Is he sick or did he just step out for a smoke, is he in a conference or out of town? “You try again. This time the girl's voice is a little sharper: ‘I told you he isn't around.’ “‘Excuse me, what's your name?’ “‘None of your business. I repeat, Ivanov isn't around.’ “And again she hangs up. “Now you start getting a little tense and try a third time. “‘Now look, Miss, don't hang up. I need Ivanov urgently.’ “At the other end the voice says: “‘Comrade, you're bothering me. I told you twice Ivanov isn't around. He's on vacation and will be back in three weeks.’ “‘Why didn't you say so right away? Who is taking his place?’ “‘I don't know,’ and so it goes.” For the benefit of Izvestia readers, Prof. Tereschenko then related how a similar conversation might run in the United States. “Say you want to call General Electric. A trained calm voice will answer, ‘General Electric. Miss Jones speaking. “The laconic answer is, ‘Mr. Smith is out of town. Mr. Courtney is taking his place. His extension is such and such. Shall I connect you?’” Prof. Tereschenko attributed the contrast to the fact that before Miss Jones was put on the job she was trained in how to answer the telephone, how to deal with clients and other visitors, how to address envelopes, “how to do everything swiftly and rationally.” “The result is a huge saving of time,” the professor concluded. He did not suggest that a possible explanation was the need for preserving a corporate image, a concept that is virtually unknown in the Government‐run Soviet economy. Professor Tereschenko also did not say whether he had been able to apply some of his ideas in the research institute of the Ukrainian Agriculture Ministry, where he has been employed since his return. Most of the article was devoted to a description of United States efficiency studies initiated fifty years ago by Frederick Winslow Taylor, the founder of scientific management techniques. This is a subject to which Soviet economists have been giving increasing attention in recent years in an effort to improve the organization of the Soviet economy. But effective steps by Government planners still remain to be taken.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES: One hears much these days about civil rights, but very little about man's natural rights. Ever since the dawn of history he has had the right to control his property and select his associates.

756-> Letters to The Times; Punishing Nazi Crimes
TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES: Dr. Lucie Adelsberger's letter published Feb. 24 is in error in stating that the statute of limitations bars conviction of accomplices in Nazi concentration camp murders. Court trials like the one in Frankfurt against some of the Auschwitz murderers are not merely a historical exercise, as Dr. Adelsberger appears to believe. German law (regulations of Dec. 5, 1939, and May 29, 1943) provides the identical penalty and statute of limitations (20 years) for both principals and accomplices in murder. According to the regulation of May 6, 1940, it is immaterial whether the crime was committed by a German within Germany or abroad. As late as 1962 the German Federal Supreme Court recognized that these regulations were still valid German Iaw—a stand attacked by the Nazis in Germany. Thus, contrary to Dr. Adelsberger, appropriate German punishment—only too often lacking—for Nazi criminals is still the only measuring rod as to whether Germany has overcome its past.

759-> LAOS TALK SNAGGED ON TRUCE POLICING
MUONG SOUI, Laos, Jan. 7 (AP)—The commanders of the Laotian neutralist forces and the pro‐Communist Pathet Lao troops agreed today to proclaim a cease‐fire but then broke off their meeting in a dispute over how to police it. The sound of battle echoed over the Plaine des Jarres as Gen. Kong Le of the neutralists and Gen. Chounramany Singkapo of the Pathet Lao movement met in a closed session. Both generals said later that their forces were withholding their fire. Neutralist and Pathet Lao officers at the meeting said the fighting was between Pathet Lao troops and forces of the Laotian rightists, who are not represented at the cease‐fire talks. The fighting was said to be near Xiengkhouang, 20 miles from the site of the meeting. Neutralist, Pathet Lao and right‐wing factions make up Laos and each group has its own army. Attempts to integrate the armies have collapsed.

760-> RUSK ACCENTS SPEED IN COMMUNICATIONS
WASHINGTON, April 28 (AP)—Secretary of State Dean Rusk outlined today his efforts to speed communications with embassies abroad to meet recurring crises. He told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that an improved communications system enabled the State Department to move swiftly in the recent crisis in Laos and meet other threats to peace. In testimony supporting a request for $359.3 million to finance departmental operations for the fiscal year starting July 1, Mr. Rusk said additional funds were needed in “the electronics battle going on at high levels” around the world. “Events move very rapidly in a given situation,” he said. “In the recent situation in Laos, matters could have hardened in the direction of major fighting if it had not been possible to express our views at a very early stage.” This was a reference to United States efforts to return the coalition government of Prince Souvanna Phouma, the neutralist Premier, to full operation after a coup of rightist generals seized control of Vientiane last April 19. Mr. Rusk asked the subcommittee to provide additional funds to improve the department's worldwide communications system under which it can talk directly with Ambassadors over a teletype communications system.

761-> South Rhodesia Is Told U.S. Favors Equality of Races
SALISBURY, Southern Rhodesia, Jan. 17 — The United States believes that no new arrangement is likely to succeed in white‐governed Southern Rhodesia unless it has the support of African public opinion, the American Consul General, Paul F. Geren, said here today. In an address, Mr. Geren defined the United States policy toward Southern Rhodesia by saying that it recognized that Britain had special concern and unique influence here. “Second,” he said, “we hope for continued political development along nonracial lines and elimination of racial discrimination. “Third, we hope that there will be progressive development toward the eventual goal of universal adult suffrage.” The white minority in the self‐governing British territory is opposed to independence under terins that will insure an African‐dominated Government.

766-> Indonesia Is Seeking to Expand Marketing Partnerships Abroad
BREMEN, Germany, April 18 —A joint venture by one of Indonesia's nationalized industries and capitalist traders has proved such a success that Indonesia is now seeking other “honest partnerships” in Europe and the United States to market her products. Five years ago Indonesia, having thrown off colonial rule, started a search for outlets for the products of expropriated Dutch plantations. Counting upon the fondness of Europeans for Sumatra and Java tobaccos, the Indonesians looked for European businessmen to take the place of the Rotterdam and Amsterdam merchants who had handled this crop for centuries. Over vigorous Dutch protests, Indonesian state‐owned estate company P. P. N. formed a tobacco merchants. It was known as the German‐Indonesian Tobacco Company, Ltd. In five years the venture has realized about one billion marks ($250 million). Three quarters of the sum came through sales at the Bremen Tobacco Exchange, which was founded as a result of the partnership. The rest of the sales were made by independent traders. here, and Dr. Djaki Muchtar are executive directors of the joint tobacco company. Mr. Gillessen said the Indonesians were so pleased by the experience with tobacco that they had agreed to another joint venture for the sale of Indonesian teak. He said Indonesian exports of this wood had stopped with the end of World War II. Even more signuificant, in the view of Mr. Gillessen, is that success in Bremen has led the Indonesians to seek similar partnerships for the sale of copra, spices and rubber in Hamburg, for rubber in New York and Paris, and for rubber and spices in some Dutch port cities. Germans Finance Movement The Indonesians and the Bremen tobacco merchants each provided half of the tobacco company's capital. The Germans finance the harvest and shipment to this port. The joint company gets a commission of 2 per cent on auction sales. The commission is evenly split between the Germans and Indonesians. The auctions were held at first in an old warehouse. The joint company has now moved into the modernistic Tobacco Exchange.

769-> CITIZENS' GROUPS MOVE ON ALBANY; Delegations Seeking Action Include Parents From City
ALBANY, Feb. 24—The visityour‐Legislature season was in full swing today. Citizens' groups from across the state swarmed through the halls of the Capitol, pressing their various demands on every available Senator and Assemblyman. A delegation of 650 parents of public‐school pupils arrived aboard a special 11‐car train from New York City. In behalf of the United Parents Associations, this group called for increased state aid to education. The parents had to share the legislators' time with the State Federation of Republican Women, the State League of Women Voters and the State Council of Churches. Governor Rockefeller greeted the Republican women at breakfast, and later, at separate sessions, answered polite but pointed questions from the league and the church group. Parents Well Organized As far as lobbying was concerned, the best‐organized group was the parents association. Each delegate had been primed aboard the train to put the assocations' case persuasively to his own legislators. Each was also assigned to call on one upstate legislator. The parents' major demand was for an increase in financial aid to local school districts. Under the present formula, the state contributes a percentage of the first $500 a pupil spent by the district. The state's share is calculated on the basis of the district's wealth, measured in terms of real estate valuation. The parents agitated for an increase in the $500‐a‐pupil ceiling, a demand that got a sympathetic hearing from many suburban legislators. The parents' legislative program also called for increased state aid for the acquisition of school sites, the continuation of free tuition at New York City colleges and an increase in the maximum Regents scholarship award from $700 a year to $1,500. Views of Governor Governor Rockefeller, at his appearance before the league, said that the Federal budget could be balanced within three years, that he was willing to make certain concessions to get the railroad full‐crew law repealed (including no loss of present jobs) and that increased aid to education could come only from higher taxes. Education was the prime topic again during the Governor's talks with the Council of Churches. However, he was questioned most sharply by this group on his proposals to amend the liquor laws. In the face of skeptical queries, the Governor insisted that there would be no increase in liquor consumption if the Legislature adopted recommendations by the Moreland Commission to abolish the requirement that bars and grills serve meals, to remove present limitations on the number and location of liquor stores and to remove price fixing on liquor. The first two of these recommendations, he said, would remove “the temptation to corruption.” The Governor also reiterated his opposition to Mayor Wagner's plan to legalize and tax off‐track betting on horse races.

771-> Poverty War Assailed As a Plan to Get Votes
WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 (UPI)—The president of the United States Chamber of Commerce attacked President Johnson's war on poverty today as a “billion‐dollar boondoggle” designed to win votes rather than help the poor. Edwin P. Neilan, a Wilmington, Del., banker and head of the chamber, said that while “everyone supports the purposes of the war on poverty,” it must be a “real war, not a sham battle staged to cover the looting of the public treasury.” Mr. Neilan addressed the opening of the chamber's third annual association public‐affairs conference. He listed Federal programs that he said were being falsely advocated as cures for poverty. The list included the area‐redevelopment program, accelerated public works, urban renewal, public housing, mass‐transit subsidies, medical care for the aged and the effort to develop the 10‐state Appalachian region.

772-> Foundation Places 8 City High Schools Among Top in U.S.
PRINCETON, N. J., Feb. 27—Eight New York City high schools are among the nation's leaders in turning out graduates who win Woodrow Wilson Foundation fellowships. Leading the list, the foundation announced today, is the Bronx High School of Science with 100 winners, followed by Stuyvesant High School with 59. Both are highly selective public schools where the gifted abound. Among the others at the top of the list were Erasmus Hall High School, Brooklyn, 39; the High School of Music and Art, 36; Phillips Academy, Andover, Mass., 35; Forest Hills High School, Jamaica, Queens, 30; Central High School, Philadelphia, 30; Regis High School, a Jesuit School in Manhattan, 27; Hunter College High School, 25; Midwood High School, Brooklyn, 25, and Phillips Exeter Academy, New Hamnshire 25. The foundation made a survey to determine the high school origins of students elected as fellows since 1958. The announcement also showed that the secondary schools of the state led the list with 1,216 winners. The runnerun was California with 505. The fellowships are awarded annually to 1,000 college seniors chosen from among 10,000 on a competitive basis as a means of encouraging them to select college teaching as a career. The fellowships are for the first year of graduate study. Dr. Hans Rosenhaupt, national director of the foundation, noted that between 1954 and 1960 New York City high school graduates had accounted for 62 per cent of the state's total. “Some possible explanations for New York City's splendid showing in this study occur to me,” he said. “New York has several selective, high‐ability schools. New York City students—even those from underprivileged homes—have a high aspiration level; they know that if they excel in secondary school, they can count on a free college education in the City University system. “New Yorkers as a group may be smarter than other people.”

776-> ON GROUNDCOVERS Low‐Growing Ornamentals Can Fill Many Roles in the Landscape
GARDENERS often use groundcovers as a last resort in areas which are too shady, too dry to support grass growth or too steep to mow. But the gardener who considers groundcovers only as desperation choices overlooks the fine design qualities to be found in this plant group. Landscape architects often choose groundcovers deliberately for design purposes. One of their strongest design attributes is that the plants can be depended upon to remain in scale. They range in size from the very dwarf, almost mosslike carpets of common thyme to three‐foot shrubs like forsythia Arnold Dwarf and spreading cotoneaster. With age, most groundcovers become dense and attractive. Good cultural practices will usually restore vigor to any planting which has become sparse. Groundcovers can naturalize a site in a relatively short time, hence their appeal for use with contemporary architecture. Homeowners often seek a kind of middle way between the meticulously tended suburban “villa” with its associated landscape chores, and a property where wild nature prevails. Typical foundation plantings add unnecessary clutter and often confuse and obscure the form of a good building. Groundcovers provide a natural foil for any structure. In the Northeast the basic three are English ivy, pachysandra and myrtle. Any one of these can produce an elegant evergreen background for flowers. Narcissus, crocus, scilla and most of the other spring‐flowering bulbs can be effectively naturalized in a groundcover bed. Tulip species which have to be dug up annually are not recommended for interplanting. Interplanting also works well with flowering perennials. Potted plants such as chrysanthemums and begonias can be plunged pot and all into the groundcover. They are removed when flowers fade. With or without the flowers, the beds have a tidy appearance. Such a bed is almost weed‐proof, a great asset to homeowners who take long vacations. The familiar three groundcovers, and even some lesserknown types, can be combined for interesting textural compositions. European ginger (Asarum europaeum) is a choice semi ‐ evergreen groundcover having no specific requirements other than partial shade. The evergreen Galax aphylla needs acid soil as well as partial shade. Daylilies and hosta are groundcover ‐ type perennials that mingle well with evergreen varieties. Plants combined in this way offer areas of heightened interest with little upkeep. The trick for success is to be certain that all of the species are adapted to the chosen site. In a more formal manner, different types of groundcovers can be combined to make definite patterns. It is possible to achieve designs and swirls of great virtuosity, reminiscent of the formal bedding designs so popular in times past. The obvious problem is to control or prevent merging of the different plant clusters which would disrupt the clarity of the pattern. Metal root barriers may be sunk into the soil to control the spread. The graceful, spreading cotoneaster can hardly be surpassed as a low specimen for a focal point in a sunny site. The Canby pachistima is one of the best plants for sun or shade. It does best in a welldrained, slightly acid soil; otherwise it needs little attention. Most of the groundcovers will be injured if walked on. There are a few that can be walked on occasionally and these are suitable for planting on a terrace. The trailing phlox (P. subulata), the moss tufted sandwort (Arenaria verna caespitosa) and several of the thymes, especially mother ‐ of ‐ thyme (Thymus serpyllum) will tolerate terrace conditions. They can be planted in random pockets or allowed to fill in the joints between bricks or paving stones. Thyme has an extra asset: its stems and leaves give off a pleasant fragrance when bruised.

777-> Monologue by Cushing Wows 'Em in Jersey City; Cardinal's Two‐Hour Talk Draws Loud Laughs at St. Peter's College
JERSEY CITY, Feb. 28—If any of the 500 students and priests who packed the St. Peter's College auditorium here today was looking forward to a theological dissertation from Richard Cardinal Cushing, he was probably disappointed. For instead, to loud laughter and long applause, the 67‐yearold Archbishop of Boston delivered a two‐hour stand‐up monologue ranging from what it is like to be a Cardinal (“All I have been doing is roaming around collecting money”) to a grass‐roots theory of ecumenism (“Kindness and love are more important than scholarship”). Between anecdotes, the Cardinal found time to address himself to his topic—“The Cardinal of Boston Reflects on Vatican Council II.” The prelate said, for example, that the ecumenical movement would “fall on its face” if the council did not approve a statement on religious liberty. He said such a statement, which would in essence recognize the right of people to embrace the religion their conscience dictates, was essential to the Roman Catholic Church's position in the movement that seeks closer cooperation among Christians. He predicted a declaration would be approved at the third session of the council this fall. The occasion for the Cardinal's 18‐hour visit was the presentation to him of the college's Petrean Medal, an award for leadership that he said he would treasure “next to the dog‐tags of dear Jack Kennedy.” The identification tags were given to him by Mrs. Kennedy. Last night the Cardinal made another two‐hour speech at a dinner attended by Gov. Richard J. Hughes. This morning he spoke at a breakfast for the faculty, and after his speech in the auditorium he held a press conference that lasted more than an hour. In all, more than a third of his visit was spent on the speaker's platform. In his talk on the Ecumenical Council, Cardinal Cushing stressed the need for an updating of the church to allow mcre participation of the laity and to counteract the influence of Communism. He also spoke of his difficulty in understanding the Latin spoken at the gathering — “I didn't know whether it was Chinese or Eskimo.” He recalled that a few weeks after the first session began he went to Pope John XXIII to complain of his difficulty. “Are you a theologian?” the Pope asked. “I only know what I learned in my catechism,” the Cardinal replied. “Shake hands,” Pope John said, and then gave him permission to return to Boston. Among Cardinal Cushing's other observations were these: On school boycotts— “I am opposed to them on the principle that children should be educated, not exploited. They are the wrong means to the right end.” On Federal aid to parochial; schools—“I don't believe in it except when it would contribute to President Johnson's campaign against poverty.” On the moral implications of smoking—“Well. I smoke.” On Pope John XXIII—“There was something supernatural about him. He could have kept Martin Luther in the fold.” On who is allowed in a nunnery—“Even the Holy Ghost couldn't get in there.” On the proposal for a married deaconate of laymen—“The bishops will govern the church, the priests will do all the work and the deacons will have all the fun.” On whether is it proper to call Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba a Communist—“When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.”

778-> Port Traffic Declined 3% in ’63 With 24,888 Ships Recorded
New York and the 10 other leading seaports of the nation had a decline in oceangoing ship traffic last year, the Maritime Association of the Port of New York reported yesterday. The association's statistical review showed that this port registered a total of 24,888 vessels, a decrease of 3.1 pr cent from the 25,684 vessels recorded it 1962. Ship arrivals here during the last year numbered 12,448, with an aggregate net tonnage of 72,660,805, a decrease in comparison with 1962 of 328,794 tons. The 25‐day strike of longshoremen in January of last year accounted for a notable slump in both arrivals and departures. Sailings dropped to 604, compared with 1,098 for the month in 1962, and arrivals fell to 718 compared with 1,109 in January, 1962. The greatest activity occurred in March, with a high for the year of 1,121 arrivals, 110 short of the record of 1,231 arrivals recorded in March, 1959. The highest number of departures for 1963 also occurred in March, with 1,142 vessels leaving the port. The Port of Philadelphia, with a slight decline in traffic compared with 1962, retained its position as the country's second busiest port. New York's share of the total volume of ship traffic of 107,395 arrivals and departures at the 11 major ports amounted to 23.1 per cent rast year, a decrease of one‐tenth of 1 per cent from the 1962 figure Philadelphia's share was 11.9 per cent, compared with 12 per cent for the previous 12 months. Ship traffic into and out of that port decreased by 491 vessels under the 13,347 arrivals and departures there in 1962 Of the 24,888 vessels moving through the Port of New York last year, 18,785 were in the dry cargo and passenger trades, of which 6,643 were American and 12,142 were foreign, and 6,103 were tankers An analysis shows that 44.8 per cent of the vessels using the port last year were under the American flag Thre were 10,057 United States‐flag ar‐. rivals and sailings, compared with 14,831 of foreign registry. Forty‐eight nations were represented by ships calling ’_.ere, hith the top place among them, as usual, going to the vessels of Norway. which had a total of 2,845 arrivals and departures, a decrease of 200 vessels from 1962 Second place went to Britain, with 1,682 movements compared with 1,628 for 1962 The Netherlands with 1,192, a gain of 10 vessels over 1962, and Liberia hith 1,184 ranked third and fourth, respectiveIy.

779-> Foreign Affairs; How to Try Without Really Succeeding
PARIS - Gaston Defferre's quest for the French Presidency looks like a matter of how to try in politics without really succeeding. Defferre is the able, popular Mayor of Marseilles and that curious French anomaly, a rich Socialist with a yacht. He has started what he imagines is an American style campaign, two years early, but the thought that he could defeat de Gaulle, or any man awarded the General's accolade in late 1965, seems illusory. Leon Blum, the last great Socialist, was a prosperous, elegant intellectual who kept a rose in a crystal vase on his desk. Guy Mollet, a later Socialist Premier, did the rather unsocialistic thing of promoting the Suez invasion. Their Socialist party only recently and with some doubts endorsed Defferre's candidacy. Defferre as a candidate was invented by the liberal weekly, L'Express, which first called him “Monsieur X.” It featured a silhouette of “Monsieur X” that was actually a blacked out photograph of an Express employe, bearing marked resemblance to Defferre and also to the magazine's editor, who is not without political ambitions himself. Later “Monsieur X” was unveiled as Defferre. The idea was to glamorize Defferre as a magnet to attract both left‐wing and center anti‐Gaullists, but this works better in theory than in fact. Defferre will probably in the end serve only as a stalking horse for some later aspirant in a later election, not the next. His own Socialists were by no means deliriously happy to endorse him; the Communists are stand‐offish; and the center parties prefer a conservative. De Gaulle crippled France's politicians when he came in almost six years ago and produced a new Constitution and a method of governing in more direct contact with the people, bypassing parties. The Third and Fourth Republics had chosen leaders by a system of temporary alliances called “ In a first round of balloting all parties presented tickets and, in a second round, they arranged private pacts for a duel between the two leading vote‐getters. The parties always united to defeat de Gaulle's former organization, the R.P.F., but when this disbanded in 1953 its death perplexed the paradoxical politicians and their intricate “third force” politics. The parties no longer had a common enemy, so they fought each other. Since resuming power de Gaulle formed a new bloc, the U.N.R., and endowed it with a massive propaganda apparatus. One reads embarrassingly fulsome descriptions of “Gaullism” in U.N.R. publications. Gaullism is “unconditional love,” or “efficiency” or “a lived experience.” Gaullists‐not including de Gaulle ‐read such claptrap with pleasure. The General towers above both rivals and admirers. The satirical Canard Enchaine claims a public opinion poll shows 94 per cent of Frenchmen “extremely happy” with de Gaulle, 22.5 per cent “very happy,” 98 per cent “happier than ever” and 0.5 per cent just “happy.” De Gaulle resurrected French selfconfidence and produced stability despite his ambitious foreign policy. And he has disintegrated organized opposition. In 1958 France had only one political problem‐how to bring de Gaulle back to Paris. The only political problem now is how to send him back to his country estate. But de Gaulle, not Defferre, will make that decision. De Gaulle doesn't really believe anyone can be a valid “successor” to himself, but he would surely prefer a follower to an opponent. And should he endorse some loyal backer, it is hard to imagine how that loyal backer would lose. Like an old Moorish king, de Gaulle's corpse could be led before the voters strapped on a horse and shatter any opposing politician's army. In a Western democratic sense, Gaullism bears resemblance to Titoism in an Eastern communistic sense. Tito pursued a policy independent of Moscow while staying Communist. De Gaulle considers his version of democracy the best and thumbs his nose at Washington. The French seem to relish this. And even Defferre made himself out a kind of poor man's Gaullist. He wants “national independence” and opposes U.S. investments in France. He accepts de Gaulle's Constitution and embraces Gaullist institutions while repudiating the General's style and method. Neither the true left nor the conservative right has much interest in this approach, and de Gaulle holds the vital center ‐ as de Gaulle knows.

780-> MODEL CITY PRISON GIVEN A PREVIEW; $10 Million Rikers Facility Lacks Jail Features
The city showed off its newest prison yesterday—a $10,352,068 three‐story building on Rikers Island with pastel cells, tables for four in the mess hall and other amenities indicating that aungeons have come a long way since the bad old days. Corrections Commissioner Anna M. Kross took prison officials from throughout the country on a tour of the new Correctional Reception and Classification Center for Men on the prison island in the East River. The excursion came on a day that saw the city's prison population rise—part of a long, gradual increase—to a record of 11,594 persons. This is 4,287 prisoners, or 58 per cent, beyond the designed capacity of the 11 detention facilities. The new building, with a capacity of 1,204 prisoners will ease, but not cure, congestion when it comes into service this spring. The visitors were members of the Board of Directors of the American Correctional Association meeting here this week. They saw a building in glazed beige brick with virtually no identifiable prison features visible from the outside—and very few in the interior. It will be used as a first stop for all prisoners sentenced to terms of 30 days or more. After initial screening, about a third —mostly first offenders — of the 50 to 60 daily admissions will be given intensive diagnost ic processing to determine the ourse that will most quickly and surely lead to rehabilitation. Most of the prisoners still will be passed on to the adult and adolescent branches of the main prison on the island. The new facility willl keep so‐called “incidental” offenders — traffic cases, nonsupport prisoners and even first time petit larceny offenders. When the new prison opens, the old Workhouse on Hart Isand — which today had 1489 prisoners in space designed for 801—will be “decompressed” to about 900, according to Anthony Principe, director of operations for the Corrections Department. The Hart Island jail then will house only prisoners serving terms of less than30 davs_ The new prison has only 134 individual cells, which will be used principally for admission occupancy by adolescent firsttime prisoners in the 16‐to‐21 age bracket to isolate them from repeaters and older prisoners. The individual cells look as inviting as a small compaet room in a ski lodge. They are painted alternately pastel green or light beige, are approximately seven by ten feet and contained a nonsag bed, toilet, washbasin and mirror, and built‐in table and stool.

781-> Powell to Back Johnson And Join in His Campaign
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31—Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Democrat of Manhattan, who refused to support his party's national ticket in 1956, has enlisted in the campaign to elect President Johnson. After a conference with the President at the White House today Mr. Powell reported that he was hacking Mr. Johnson and had “already started campaigning for him.” The Representative declared that Mr. Johnson “gets stronger every day” among Negro votters, “and Im going to do my best to see that it gets even stronger than that.” Eight years ago Mr. Powell endorsed former President Dwight D. Eisenhower a month before the national election, charging that Adlai E. Stevenson had snubbed Negro groups. In 1960 he announced his support of John F. Kennedy seven weeks before the election.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Feb. 13—Duke Snider, the most distinguished New York Met in appearance and accomplish­ment, accepted a 1964 contract today for $32,000. This was a cut of $6,000 from his salary of last season. The 37‐year‐old outfielder, who has hit more than 400 home runs in National League compe­tition, agreed to terms in a tele­phone conversation with Johnny Murphy, the club's personnel director. Snider is at his home in California, Murphy is here attending the rookie camp be­ing conducted by Manager Casey Stengel and his coaches. “I think Snider can play two more years,” Stengel declared, “if I use him right, and I have to confess that I didn't use him the best way last year. “I can't tell you what number of games he'll play, but I can say I'll use better judgment about when he should play and when he shouldn't. I know I handicapped him last year in my decisions as a manager when I pushed him two or three days too far. “But we didn't have enough other men on the club who could do the job, especially right‐handed hitters, and I'd put him in when I knew I shouldn't. But I know this—he's a terrific ballplayer and he still hits a lot of home runs and they weren't all Polo Grounds jobs; some of them had good distance on them.” If Snider can start 90 to 100 games as a right fielder and pinch hit the rest of the time, he will do all that can be ex­pected from a man his age who has had chronic knee trouble. Duke is aware of this. He expected a pay cut and was willing to take one, not because he felt shame about his .243 batting average and total 14 home runs last year. but be­cause he realized he didn't and couldn't play full time. The first Met offer, of $30,­000, represented a cut of 21 per cent, and Snider felt that this was a little too much. He wrote back and expressed his feeling, and sounded out the possibility of being a player‐coach. Then he and Murphy settled matters on the phone. “He's not a coach, he's a player, because I think he can still play,” said Stengel. “I want him in the best shape, and it's up to me to make it possible for him to do his best.” Snider will report on Feb. 26 and will be a member of the 22‐man squad that will go to Mexico for three games March 6–8. The rest of the Met regu­lars are not due until March 1. Eleven of the Mets on the 40‐man roster are still unsign­ed. They are Al Jackson, Carl Willey, Jay Hook, Galen Cisco and Craig Anderson, pitchers; Ron Hunt, Rod Kanehl and Al Moran. infielders; Chris Can­nizzaro and Bob Taylor, catch­ers, and Joe Christopher, out­fielder. This will be Snider's 18th National League season. His lifetime batting average is .298. He has hit 403 home runs in the National League and 11 in World Series competition. He ranks among the great slug­gers. .

784-> Post Office Giving Mailmen a Weapon In War With Dogs
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (UPI) — When a dog makes a lunge at the neighborhood postman from now on, he may find out that he is biting off more than he can chew. Postmaster General John A. Gronouski said today that the Post Office would spend about $90,000 to equip letter. carriers with a stinging, but harmless, dog.repellent spray. The capsules, to be worn on the belt so that postmen can draw quickly, carry threefourths of an ounce of fluid liquid made up of pepper extract and mineral oil. They will be supplied to letter carriers in 6,000 cities throughout the country by this summer. Mr. Gronouski said the capsules would allow postmen to squirt a “vigorous, thin jet stream” of the repellent into the face of a charging dog. The attacker is then supposed to put his tail between his legs and retreat. The Postmaster General said tests of the Aerosol car tridges in four large cities had roved them 84 per cent effective He added that failures were usually the fault of postmen who either were not fast enough on the draw or were unable to hit their targets. Mr. Gronouski said that the problem of dogs' biting postmen was not a laughing matter. He said that some 7,000 Post Office employes were bitten last year at a cost of about $1 million in sick leave, medical expenses and painful antirabies treatments.

787-> Gulf Reports Discovery Off Africa's West Coast
The Gulf Oil Corporation has made what may prove to be a most important oil discovery off the west coast of Africa. The company announced yesterday the completion of its first wildcat well seven miles offshore on a 2,000‐square mile concession in the western part of the Niger Delta area. The well is 40 miles west of the nearest oil discovery on shore in Nigeria. The well, situated in 30 feet of water, has been producing at the rate of 2,000 barrels a day of 36 gravity crude oil on a one‐half inch choke from a depth of 6,100 feet. Additional drilling is planned by Gulf on its offshore acreage. Several other companies are carrying on exploratory operations in the same general area, and the Gulf discovery is expected to stimulate their activity. Nigeria now has an oil output of about 75,000 barrels a day.

792-> INSPECTION URGED ON YEAR‐OLD CARS; Albany Committee Also Asks a Rise in Speed Limit and Conformity by the City
ALBANY, Feb. 2 — State inspection of all automobiles and other motor vehicles over a year old would be required under a bilI placed before state lawmakers by a joint legislative committee. The plan would replace the present system of annual inspections for motor vehicles over four years old. It would affect up to two million cars, trucks, tractors and other conveyances not covered by the present law. The bill is backed by the bipartisan Joint Legislative Committee on Motor Vehicles and Traffic Safety, one of the most aggressive legislative bodies in the capital. Road checks have shown that new cars have almost as many defects as old cars, the committee chairman, Senator Edward J, Speno, Republican of East Meadowiw, L. I., said. He and other committee members said that New York should “get in step” with 19 other states that now require yearly inspection of all motor vehicles. A spokesman for William S. Huits, the State Motor Vehicle Commissioner, said today that the commissioner had consistently supported broadening the state inspection program. Other measures submitted by the Motor Vehicle Committee would: ¶Raise the lowest maximum speed limit in the state from 25 to 30 miles an hour. ¶Require licensing tests for motorcycle operators. ¶Require that all commercial vehicles be equipped with defrosters. All new cars are so equipped, but many trucks are not. ¶Require that New York City conform to statewide law and Federal recommendations calling for uniform sizes and color combinations in traffic signs. On this last point, the committee said, “many of the signs in New York City are too small for safety's sake, incorrect in shape and the wrong color combination for visibility.” The Wagner administration has said it would cost too much for the city to install traffic lights conforming to the committee's recommendations:

793-> GULF OIL PROFITS REACH NEW HIGH; Net Earnings Advance 9% to $3.56 a Share in '63
The Gulf Oil Corporation reported yesterday that its estimated net earnings in 1963 reached a record of $371 million, or $3.56 a share, an increase of 9 per cent over netincome of $340,091,000, or $3.27 a share. in 1962. The company's capital and exploratory expenditures last year also set a new high of about $700 million, surpassing the preceding high of $615 million in 1962. Such outlays for 1964 are programed at $600 million, but do not include several projects under consideration. Among the projects not included in these estimates are a refinery in the United States and possibly a refinery in Europe. Should these and other projects now being considered materialize, Gulf said, capital expenditures for 1964 probably will exceed those of 1963. Gulf's indicated net earnings for the final quarter of 1963 were $101,000,000, or 97 cents a share, compared with $103,831,000, or $1 a share, in the 1962 periou. Directors of Gulf, at a meeting held yesterday in Houston elected two new senior vice presidents They are Cliff W Peery and Dr. Alexander Lewis .Jr. Mr. Peerv will have executive responsibilities for production and exploration and Dr. Lewis for petrochemicals. The Cities Service Company reported yesterday that net income last year rose to $77.5 million, or $5.92 a common share. This is an increase of 10 per cent over the 1962 net income of $70,435,000, or $5.33 a common share.

794-> Moored Unit Used as Terminal For Liquids in Shallow Harbors
Almost any shallow harbor on any coastline in the world can be converted into a marine terminal for liquid cargo, Adm. Arthur W. Radford says. The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is now chairman of Imodco International, Ltd., which has acquired control of an offshore mooring unit developed six years ago in Sweden. The system he discussed could open remote areas of the world to markets for petroleum and other fluid cargoes. The heart of the system is a buoy‐like central chamber around which a rotating arm links great hoses to deep‐draft tankers. The oil flows through the link‐hoses from conduits connected to landside pipelines at the refineries. Admiral Radford said at a press conference last week that the facility would sharply reduce loading and unloading time at many busy domestic and foreign ports where channel drafts are less than 30 feet. The new supertankers, drawing in excess of 35 feet, have to load and unload their cargoes with the assistance of smaller tankers, a time‐consuming and costly operation. Admiral Radford pointed out that only two major harbors in the United States—Long Beach and Los Angeles—could accommodate ships of over 40 feet draft. “There are several hundred deep‐draft vessels sailing the ocean today which can't enter many major ports because they draw more than 40 feet,”; he said. The installation is in operation abroad and, while there is none in the United States, several oil companies were represented at the press conference and expressed interest in it. Basically, the Imodco terminal is a large circular vessel firmly secured to the sea bottom. The rotating mooring arm permits ships to swing completely around the terminal. The off‐shore location also depends on the user and on the depth of the waters. One installation abroad is seven miles from shore. Among the installations in foreign countries, one is used by the West German Navy for fueling deep‐draft vessels. Others are in operation in Japan and South Korea.

795-> Gunman Gets $30,000 Gems And Escapes in Midtown Chase
A nattily dressed bandit held up a retail jewelry shop on the Avenue of the Americas yesterday morning and escaped with gems estimated to be worth $30.000. He fired a pistol shot through the store ceiling after the store's security guard, a retired patrolman, hurled a mending‐tape dispenser at him as he left. The guard pursued the robber for two blocks but lost him in the crowds. Henry Rosenberg, 53 years old, of 200 Central Park South, an owner of Modell's jewelry and pawn brokerage store at 1172 Avenue of the Americas, at 46th Street, said the bandit entered the place about 10:45 A.M., to resume negotiations for the “purchase” of $50,000 in gems that he began on Friday. The man, about 27 years old, was well‐spoken and calm, Mr. Rosenberg said. He had explained that he wanted to buy some diamond an ruby pieces for his mother as an investment to avoid tax payments. He had told Mr. Herman he was Sid Sable of Red Bank, N. J., and would pay by check when he had made his selections. When he returned to the store on the busy avenue yesterday there were no customers in the place. The bandit made additional selections to those he picked out last week. He placed a tan dispatch case on the glass counter, opened the case and took out a revolver. He pointed it at Mr. Rosenberg. “If you want to be smart and live, put all the jewelry in there, he said, pointing to the open case. Mr. Rosenberg began placing necklaces and bracelets, fashioned of diamonds and rubies into the case, but his slow movements appeared to annoy the bandit. Suddenly the gunman slammed the case shut. Five employes of the shop, including Joseph Reinis, 66, of 99‐32 66th Road, Forest Hills, Queens, the security guard, who retired as a patrolman from the Police Department 16 years ago, watched the episode in frozen fascination. As the bandit moved toward the door, Mr. Reinis picked up a three‐pound mending‐tape dispenser and hurled it at the gunman, striking him on the shoulder. The man whirled, fired a shot into the ceiling and fled southward on the avenue. Mr. Reinis chased him eastward on 45th Street, but lost him at Fifth Avenue.

796-> LOCKHEED SHOWS DROP IN EARNINGS; Profits Decline for Quarter Despite Increased Sales
The Lockheed Aircraft Corporation increased its firstquarter sales to $434,834,000 from $426,182,000 a year earlier, but earnings were off slightly. Net income amounted to $10,565,000, equal to 98 cents a share, compared with $10,822,000, or $1.02 a share, for the March quarter last year. The results were disclosed yesterday by Daniel J. Haughton, president, before the annual meeting of shareholders in Burbank, Calif. The decline in earnings was attributed to the fact that a loss carryover available in the 1963 period from operations of the Lockheed Propulsion Company were consolidated into the parent company in February, 1963. There was no such credit in the first quarter of 1964, Dudley E. Browne, financial vice president, said. The backlog of unfilled orders at the end of the first quarter totaled $1,419,000,000, compared with $1,441,000,000, a year earlier, the president reported. In reply to a question on increased dividends, Mr. Gross said that the company probably would seek to conserve cash because of investments that could enhance “long‐term earnings power of the company.” Lockheed pays 40 cents quarterly. Stockholders increased the board membership to 17 from 15, electing Clarence L. (Kelly) Johnson and A. Carl Kotchian as new directors. They are corporate vice presidents of Lockheed.

MINNEAPOLIS, May 12 —An electronic storm‐warning device, termed the first major development of its kind since radar, was shown here today. The device is known as SPARSA—for sferics, pulse, azimuth, rate and spectrum analyzer. It detects, at a distance up to 200 miles, radio impulses from lightning and lightninglike electrical discharges in clouds. Impulses from these discharges, known as sferics, are fed into other electronic equipment that records the direction and intensity of a storm. SPARSA was announced by the Minneapolis‐based Applied Science Division of Litton Industries, Inc., of Beverly Hills, Calif. It was developed by Douglas Kohl, a 40‐year‐old electrical engineer for the division.

DENVER, May 29 (UPI)—Sonny Liston, former heavyweight champion, was fined $600 today on charges of carrying a concealed weapon and reckless ‐driving and given a 30‐day suspended jail sentence. Municipal Judge Dan Diamond imposed the fines after Liston pleaded no contest to the concealed weapon charge and guilty to the traffic charge. The disposition of the traffic case was seen as clearing away a major obstacle to arrangements for a rematch between Liston and Cassius Clay this year. Clay lifted Liston's crown at Miami last Feb. 25. Judge Diamond fined Liston $300 on the weapon charge and $300 on the reckless driving count. Liston was arrested March 10 after a Denver patrolman said he had clocked the ex‐champion's Cadillac at 76 m.p.h. in a 30‐mile zone. The officer said Liston had no valid driver's license and was carrying a 22‐caliber revolver.

804-> U. S. BAR PRESSES SUCCESSION PLAN; Presidential Inability to Be Subject of National Drive
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24—The American Bar Association will seek to alert the nation this spring to the need for a constitutional amendment on Presidential inability and the filling of Vice‐Presidential vacancies. Plans for the nationwide educational program were disclosed today by Walter E. Craig of Phoenix, Ariz., president of the association, in testimony before a Senate subcommittee. “This nation can no longer afford to risk a period where there is uncertainty as to who is exercising the powers and duties of the Presidency,” he said. Mr. Craig said that the campaign would open next month with a conference in Washington, to be attened by leaders of various national organizations. The proposed constitutional amendment for which the bar association will seek support was outlined by Mr. Craig and Lewis F. Powell Jr. of Richmond, Va., president‐elect of the American Bar Association. Committee Studying Question The Senate subcommittee on constitutional amendments is conducting hearings on a number of proposals dealing with means of determining Presidential disability and with the filling of Vice‐Presidential vacancies. The bar association's program, drawn up at a special conference last month and approved recently by its House of Delegates, calls for a constitutional amendment that would provide for these steps: ¶The President, in writing, could declare his inability to perform the duties of office. In the event that the President did not make his inability known, it could be established by the Vice President or the person next in line of succession, with the concurrence of a majority of the Cabinet or by action of some other body as Congress provides by law. ¶The President, in writing, could declare his ability to resume the duties of office. If the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet or other body provided by Congress did not concur, the issue could then be decided by the vote of twothirds of the members of each House of Congress. ¶When a vacancy occurs in the office of Vice President, the President could nominate someone to fill the office, upon approval by a majority of members of Congress meeting in joint session. Opposition to the bar association's proposal on determining Presidential disability was expressed by Martin Taylor, chairman of the Constitutional Law Committee of the New York Bar Association. Constitutional amendments, he argued, should be simple and not go into detail. The bar association's proposal, he said, “violates the basic principle of constitutional law.” The wisdom of the proposal was also questioned by Senator Kenneth B. Keating, Republican of New York, who is a member of the subcommittee. He suggested that it would stir up such debate that ratifcationn by three‐fourths of the state legislatures might not be obtained. Senator Keating joined Sena‐ tor Estes Kefauver, Democrat of Tennessee, in sponsoring a proposed constitutional amendment last year to allow Congress to pass a law dealing with Presidential disability. The bill is now pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee.

807-> Nazi Warplane Lands On L.I.—Peacefally
AMITYVILLE, L. I., Jan. 22—Onlookers stared in mild disbelief today when a World War II Messerschmitt 108, its fuselage painted with Nazi swastikas and military crosses, swooped into Zahn's Airport here. But there were no fireworks. The German singleengined plane had been purchased for private use by Martin Caidin of Plainview, L. I., an aviation writer. He paid $8,500 for it last July. Delivery of the four‐place craft was accomplished by three British adventurers at a total cost to Mr. Caidin of $2,500. The three flyers landed at 4:40 P.M. after a two‐month trip from Ipswich, England. They were John Hawke, 27 years old, a stunt flyer and former Royal Air Force pilot; his fiancée, Jean Cullum, 24, and Francis Freeman, a 23year‐old pilot. They had been plagued en route with frustrating groundings and delays because of bad weather, mechanical and instrument failures and a final indignity of having their craft impounded for four hours at Burlington, Vt., as a dangerous weapon.

808-> ELEKTRA LABEL ‘Nonesuch’ Is the Name the Company Has Given to Its Classical Line
ELEKTRA Records, which was founded in 1950 by Jac Holzman as a purveyor of folk music, sound effects and spoken disks, has branched into the classical field with the release of 10 albums on a new subsidiary label, whimsically called “Nonesuch.” The series will be priced at $2.50 for both monophonic and stereo disks, and since Mr. Holzman felt there was no such comparative value at the price, he named it aocordingly. Thirty‐five albums are scheduled for release this year; the first was issued in February after plans for the new venture were drawn up in October of last year. Elektra's other subsidiary label, Crestview, which sells for $3.98, is a current‐popular line. The Elektra disks retail at $4.98 for mono, and $5.95 for stereo. Many companies offer monophonic disks at as low as $1.98. Cumberland prices both its mono and stereo disks at that figure, but the low price for all other companies' stereo records is $2.98, although they are normally higher with most releases in this category. Focus The Nonesuch label will concentrate on baroque music and some contemporary chamber music. Two of the initial releases contain Handel's Dettingen Te Deum, in a performance by the Telemann Society Festival Chorus and Orchestra directed by Richard Schulze (H 1003; stereo H 71003), and Chants de la Renaissance de Claude Le Jeune by the Jean‐Paul Kreder Ensemble (H 1001; stereo H 71001) . Although the Handel was recorded here, most of the disks are made from tapes leased from European recording companies like the Club Francais du Disques. These tapes are re‐engineered by Nonesuch at the Sonic record factory in Freeport, Long Island. When a tape is not stereo, no attempt is made to re‐channel the monophonic version. Next year it will do some of its own recording in Europe. Because Elektra's distribution outlets, sales and art departments are well developed, the new line has had no trouble and, reports Mr. Holzman, Nonesuch is already in the black. Elektra employs 14 people. Only in Part Handel's “Dettingen Te Deum” is an interesting work in that only 6 of its 16 sections are by him. The other 10 are attributed to the obscure Italian composer Urio. The performance by the Telemann Society is on the whole a good one. Mr. Schulze sets solid tempos, and balances of chorus, orchestra and soloists are satisfactory. The soloists—Janet Wheeler and Eileen Laurence, sopranos; Frances Pavlices, alto; John Ferrante, tenor, and John Dennison, bass—sing accurately and effectively. The recorded sound is bright, a littie flat and wanting in bass, but pleasantly balanced. The brightness shows the trumpets off well, though, and the festive atmosphere of the “Te Deum,” which was put together to celebrate the victory of Dettingen, June 26, 1743, comes through convincingly. The Le Jeune songs are not the curiosities the “Te Deum” movements are. There are no stylistic jolts dealt like those in the Handel as the German composer alternates abruptly with the Italian. In fact the French songs are delightful in their stylistic cohesivenness, and a wonderful variety of expression is achieved within the body of 14 songs presented here.

809-> MARITIME ACCORD IN CANADA SCORED; Diefenbaker Says It Balks Goals of Parliament
OTTAWA, April6—The terms of the agreementby which the Government‐appointed trustees of Canada's maritime unions hoped to insure peace on the Great Lakes was sharply criticized in the House of Commons today. Former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker declared that under the agreement Leonard McLaughlin, executive vice president of the Seafarers International Union, would succeed Harold Banks, whom the trustees have removed from office. Mr. Diefenbaker said that Mr. McLaughlin was Mr. Banks's “man Friday” and that his succession to the presidency of the union would be against the expressed will of Parliament to rid the inland waterways of the “hoodlum empire” that dominated the S.I.U. Allan J. MacEachen, the Minister of Labor, said that the trustees had acted independently under the authority of Parliament and that they had not appointed Mr. McLaughlin to any position. However, he conceded that under the union's constitution Mr. McLaughlin would automatically become president. The agreement reached by Paul Hall, president of the Seafarers International Union, and the trustees, Mr. MacEachen said, will provide “complete freedom for Canadian ships in United States ports.” United States unions have been refusing to load or unload vessels of the Upper Lakes Shipping Company, which is manned by members of the Canadian Maritime Union, a rival of the S.I.U. and a member of the Canadian Labor Congress. All five of Canada's maritime unions were placed under a trusteeship act of Parliament last November. The trustees are headed by Justice Victor C. Dryer of British Columbia, Judge Rene Lippe of Montreal and Charles Millard, an Ontario labor negotiator.

818-> U.S. AGENCY GIVES WAIVER ON WHEAT; Tells Continental to Ship 38% in American Hulls
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12—Approximately 38 per cent of the American wheat involved in the first million‐ton sale to Russia by the Continental Grain Company will be shipped in American vessels. This was the practical effect of a decision today by the Maritime Administration granting Continental a partial waiver of the original requirement established by the Kennedy Administration that half the grain be transported in American ships. waiver covered less ton nage than Continental had requested. Whether the Maritime Administration action will satisfy various maritime unions that have been protesting the use of foreign vessels remains to be seen. The acting maritime administrator, Robert E. Giles, said, however, that he believed the unions would recognize that the waiver was granted on the specified legal ground that a sufficient volume of American cargo space was not available to transport 50 per cent of Continental's one million metric tons of wheat. Optimism Is Expressed Mr. Giles also expressed optimism that Cargill, Inc., which has a license to export 700,000 tons of grain to the Soviet Union between now and the end of May, would be able to work out arrangements with American shipowners more easily than Continental did. The waiver of the 50 per cent requirement granted to Continental covers the shipment of 58,000 long tons of grain from West Coast ports and 62,300 tons from East and Gulf Coast ports. The West Coast waiver was what Continental asked for. The company had originally asked for a waiver for 223,000 tons for shipment from East and Gulf ports. But it subsequently made arrangements for the use American ships to transport 97,900 tons of grain from these ports. Thus the maritime agency, in effect, refused a waiver for 62,800 tons, for which it found ships available under reasonable conditions. Continental will have to ship this 62,800 tons in four T‐2 tankers ruled to be “available,” or else lose that part of its sale to the Soviet Union. The tankers are the Martine, the Penn Carrier, the Transbay and the Transhartford. 3 Ships Not Available Three other ships whose use was at issue between Continental and their owners were ruled not legally available for various These are the Elemir, a T‐2 ruled unable to discharge cargo at the port of Nakhodka; the Montpelier Victory, a tanker capable of carrying 36,500 tons of wheat, the offer of which was withdrawn by the owner; and the National Defender, a large tanker that would have a draft of 39 feet if loaded with 50,000 tons of grain. The expected Russian ports of discharge can handle ships with a maximum draft of 32 feet, Mr. Giles said, under known conditions. Thus the Maritime Administration ruled the National Defender “not available.”

819-> U.S. Awaits Clarification of Two Proposed Formulas
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27—An expected settlement of thel Panama crisis was delayed today in diplomatic confusion as to who represented the Panamanian Government in the negotiations. As a result, the United States was reported to have decided to set aside two separate Panamanian proposals it had been considering and to await a new, unified approach from Panama. At a news conference this afternoon, Secretary of State Dean Rusk said that there was “no agreement yet” with Panama and that he had not yet seen a formula that “is acceptable to both governments.” However, Mr. Rusk added, when the seven‐week‐old deadlock breaks “it will break all at once.” Earlier in the day, the Assistan Secretary of State for Inter‐American Affairs, Thomas C. Mann, told a Congressional subcommittee that he regretted what he called the inaccuracy of reports published this morning that a settlement was imminent. nent. Such a report was printed in The New York Times. During testimony before the House Subcommittee on InterAmerican Affairs, Mr. Mann said: “We are not any closer to an agreement now with Panama than we were two weeks ago.” Diplomatic sources said yesterday that an agreement seemed imminent. The United States was understood to be ready to accept, with some minor reservations, a compromise formula that the Panamanian Ambassador to the Organization of American States, Miguel J. Moreno Jr. submitted last Saturday. This formula, apparently setting the stage for direct United States‐Panama talks on the future of the 1903 Canal Zone treaty, had been described here as being “most promising.” It was expected that the State Department would submit it to President Johnson for approval and then discuss the final draft with the five‐nation O.A.S. mediation subcommittee that has been conducting the negotiations. However, in the course of events yesterday, the United States received another formula from an informal mediation group at the United Nations. The formula, which appeared here to be more concise and promising than the one pre‐ pared by Ambassador Moreno, resulted from a meeting last Friday between President Roberto F. Chiari of Panama and President Francisco Orlich of Costa Rica. President Orlich had offered his good offices in the United States ‐ Panamanian dispute. Panamanian and Costa Rican delegates to the United Nations subsequently worked out a new proposal that was sent to Washington through the United States Ambassador, Adlai E. Stevenson. The authors of this formula were identified by diplomats as Panama's Ambassador, Dr. Aquilino Boyd, and the Costa Rican Ambassador, Fernando Volio Jiménez. The confusion in Washington began when the Boyd‐Volio formula arrived here and the question arose at the State Department whether it was Ambassador Boyd or Ambassador Moreno who spoke for the Panamanian Government. At a meeting yesterday morning with the O. A. S. mediation subcommittee, Ambassador Moreno assured the group that his formula was the only one that carried the endorsement of the Panamanian Government. When Mr. Mann met with the subcommittee he indicated that the United States could not state its position on either the Moreno or the Boyd formula because it did not know which of them represented the Panamanian position. Diplomatic sources said that Mr. Mann therefore had made it clear to the subcommittee that the United States had no choice but to await a unified Panamanian proposal. Ambassador Moreno sub‐ sequently repeated his insistence that the formula he had submitted carried the full endorsement of President Chiari, but the diplomatic sources suggested that the United States was no longer certain to what extent the Panamanian President had the political situation in hand. Diplomatic relations were broken by Panama following the Canal Zone riots last month.

829-> ARLEM YOUTHS GET JOB PROGRAM; Merchants Agree to Plan After Dispute on Funds
Harlem merchants and two community groups accepted a plan yesterday for an on‐thejob training program for 500 Harlem youths. They also agreed to take action on a proposed budget for the 12‐month program by Saturday afternoon. Both decisions were made during a stormy five‐hour meeting held in the offices of the City Commission on Human Rights. The commission had called the closed meeting in an attempt to resolve the differences between the merchants and the community groups. The meeting which began at 11 A.M. and was interrupted by several recesses for caucusing by both sides, quickly bogged down into a dispute over the financing of the program. The merchants, represented by the Uptown Chamber of Commerce, had offered $5,000 to start the program. But the leaders of the community groups said this was not enough. The Rev. Robert L. Kinlock, head of the newly formed Independent Community Improvement Association, said after the meeting that the organizations had been looking for “a much stronger committment” from the merchants. “If we're going to do this thing right,” Mr. Kinlock said, “then we're going to need much more to get this thing off the ground. Five thousand dollars is not enough to get a threemonth program started.” Matthew Eder, executive vice president of the chamber, said the merchants' offer had been made so that the program could begin on March 2. Further committments, he said, could not be made until the chamber's board of directors had met. “There is no basic disagreement here,” Mr. Eder explained. “the chamber is willing to assume the leadership here with the aid and participation of the groups concerned.” Yesterday's debate on financing ended when both sides agreed to let two consultant groups, the Associated Community Teams and the Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited, draw up a budget subject to their approval. However, Mr. Kinlock indicated that he might call for the resumption of picketing of the stores in the area if there was no financial agreement by Saturday. Mr. Kinlock also served as spokesman at yesterday's meeting for the Harlem Labor Union, the other sponsor of the program, and the Youth Freedom Marchers, a group of youths who have participated in picket demonstrations at the stores. The program accepted yesterday seeks to train youth for possible employment through classroom instruction and onthe‐job training. The course may last from four to six months, depending upon the nature of the job and the individual's ability. The program would be open to youths between 17 and 25 years old.

832-> House Votes Farm Funds; Rejects Curb on Red Sales
WASHINGTON, May 20—The House approved today, by a vote of 311 to 64, a $5.18 billion agriculture appropria‐tions bill. Before passage it defeated by a single vote a Republican proposal to bar subsidies on farm products sold to Communist countries. Republican proposal to bar subsidies on farm products sold to Communist countries. The unexpectedly narrow mar‐gin on the export subsidies re‐flected the running fight over trade with the Soviet Union and Communist bloc countries. It came at a time when the Ad‐ ministration has plans for ex‐ panding this trade. These plans are expected to be a prime Republican issue in the Presidential and Congres‐sional elections this Year. The House Democratic leader‐ship mustered 182 votes. These. with five Republican votes, were just enough to defeat the sub‐sidy ban on a roll‐call vote of 187 to 186. Thirty Democrats joined 156 Republicans in favor of the restriction. The vote was the climax of another day of wrangling over the money bill to finance farm price supports and other activi‐ties for the fiscal year beginning July 1. The measure now goes to the Senate, some House cuts are expected to be re‐stored, particularly funds for the Food for Peace program. While the Administration and House Democrats sought to pin an economy label on the bill, the measure will probably not save any money. Some spending was deferred through various means of financing, leaving a real possibility that supplemen‐tal appropriations will be sought later. An effort to cut off price support aid to tobacco went down in what seemed to be a lopsided voice vote Instead the bill carries extra money for research on how to remove the health ha zard from tobacco. Representative John .D. Din‐gell, Democrat of Michigan, offered the antitobacco amend‑ment as a “moral issue.” If the Government has said that smoking causes lung cancer. he said, then the Government has no business supporting the price oftobacco. An advisory committee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service has called smok‑ ing a causal factor in cancer and other diseases. House members from the robacco Belt noted today that with no price supports, Federal estrictions on acreage would also end. The result, they said, would be more tobacco to en‐able growers to earn a living and hence cheaper cigarettes and more smoking. Representative Paul Findley, Republican of Illinois, led the ive to end subsidies to ex- porters who sell farm products o Communist bloc countries. rule showdown vote came on a notion by Representative Frank P. Bow, Republican of Ohio, o send the bill back to the House Agriculture Committee with instructions to write in he Findley amendment. Mr. Findley argued that in the sale of wheat to the Soviet Union the Government's pay‑ nent of a subsidy to exporters mounted to subsidizing Corn‑ munism. The export payment is he difference between the world market price and the support price guaranteed American farmers. Representative Jamie L. Whit‐ten, Democrat of Mississippi, chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that drafted the bill, told the House that adop‐tion of the amendment would hurt American farmers. The Communists, he said, would buy he products elsewhere. Only one Republican who vot ed against the Findley amend- nent comes from a major wheat tate. He is Mark Andrews of North Dakota. The other Re‑ publicans represent urban areas. They are Peter H. B. Frelinghuysen of Morristown, N.J., John V. Lindsay of Man‐hattan, Wililan S. Mailliard of San Francisco and Charles C. Mathias of Frederick, Md. The House reversed itself to‑ day on one item. It rejected by 198 to 181 a $1.6 million proj‐ect, which it had approved yes‐terday, to establish a peanut research laboratory in Dawson, Ga. It is likely that the labora‐ tory will be proposed again in the Senate as a pet project of Senator Richard B. Russell, Democrat of Georgia.

833-> Chase Bank Makes Film Encouraging Political Donations
In what it believes is a business first, the Chase Manhattan Bank has produced a motion picture that encourages people to give money to political parties. The 13‐minute, black‐andwhite sound film will be lent free by the Chase to companies, theaters and organizations that wish to show it once or twice. Those who want to make a number of showings will be asked to buy a print for $25, which the bank said was “cast.” The over‐all outlay by the bank was about $50,000. About 100 prints have been ordered so far. A Cautious Step The Chase's decision to make and distribute the film appeared to represent another cautious step by business into the political arena. Corporations, and especially banks, have been fearful that politics, even on a nonpartisan basis, is bad for business. Some business groups, such as the United States Chamber of Commerce, have urged businessmen and other citizens to participate directly in politics, by running for office, ringing doorbells or, at least, voting. A few companies nave encouraged the contributing of money by offering to make a deduction from employe paychecks and turn the money over to the party or candidate designated by the employe. The Aerojet‐General Corporation, for example, expects to collect $150,000 from its 30,000 employes this year for political contributions, about $50,000 more than in 1960. The Chase's film, “To the Party of Your Choice,” is said by the bank to be the first motion picture that promotes giving money, as distinguished from voting or working for a party. Approved by the bank's directors in advance—among them are some of the nation's leading corporate executives—the film is scrupulously nonpartisan. Frames Counted Before a working print was shown to Democratic and Republican National Committee officials, both of which have endorsed the film, technicians ounted frame by frame to make sure the two parties had equal footage. The Chase's top two officers, George Champion, chairman, and David Rockefeller, president, are Republicans. Mr. Rockefeller is a brother of Governor Rockefeller. The bank was assisted in producing the film by Film Counselors, Inc., 500 Fifth Avenue. Screened for reporters yesterday, the film is a fast‐moving review of Presidential campaigns all the way back to William Howard Taft's in 1908. Chet Huntley, the narrator, reports that the cost of campaigning has soared from less than $100,000 for Abraham Lincoln's 1860 campaign to nearly $200 million for both major parties in 1960. Responsibility Cited “Since all citizens benefit from the political process, all have the responsibility of meeting the cost,” the bank said in a statement. Or, as Mr. Huntley concluded, “Give all that you can to the party of your choice.” An estimated two million persons in the New York metropolitan area are expected by the Chase to see the film in movie theaters by Election Day. An additional four million persons around the country may view it on television in the next 12 months. Mr. Huntley's employer, the National Broadcasting Company, has exclusive television rights to the film but the bank is trying to get permission to make it available to stations not affiliated with the network. The Chase will offer the film to its hundreds of correspondent banks and its larger corporate customers. One of them, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, is considering showing the film to its 750,000 Bell System employes. A.T.&T. chairman Frederick R. Kappel, who is a Chase director, Roger M. Blough, chairman of the United States Steel Corporation, and about 20 other corporation executives saw the film at a private screening yesterday.

834-> Tenant on 5th Ave. Wins $890 Rent Cut For Loss of Room
Court‐ordered rent reductions, usually applied to slum tenements, were applied yesterday to a 10‐room apartment on Fifth Avenue. The rent there was cut from $890 a month to zero. Three judges of the Appellate Terms of the State Supreme Court ruled that a tenant, Robert C. Scull, did not have to pay any of the rent for a fifth‐floor apartment at 1010 Fifth Avenue, near the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The building's owner, Fifth Avenue Estates, Inc., had brought the ssit to compel payment. Mr. Scull maintained that the three‐year contract he had signed with the landlords on April 17, 1962, called for 11 rooms, not 10. The landlord maintained that one bedroom in the apartment was actually two rooms, but the court ruled that a servant's room adjacent to a service hallway outside the apartment should be considered part of the apartment and turned over to Mr. Scull. The court said, “Superficially, it may appear harsh to deprive landlord of the entire rent for loss of one room out of 11.” “However, the tenant is entitled to all the space for which he agreed to pay and he need not accept less,” the judges ruled.

836-> Increasing Evidence Is Found Of Possible Cancer‐Virus Link; But Conclusive Data Lacking Whether There Is a Causative Relationship or Foreign Bodies Are Only ‘Passengers’
Scientists from no fewer than seven laboratories here and abroad have, in the last few months, reported publicly or privately the discovery of viruses in material from human cancer patients. There is yet no proof that the viruses had caused the variety of leukemias (blood cancer) and solid tumors of lymphoid tissue with which they were associated. However, many of the viruses were reported to look very much like those that are known to cause cancer in mice. Also, viruses from different cancer patients with different forms of the disease were reported to be related physically and chemically to each other. Conclusive evidence one way or the other—either that viruses are the causative agents in at least some forms of human cancer or that they are merely “passengers,” uninvolved in the basic mechanism of cancer development — is what scientists are seeking now. No one can say for sure when that “break” in the virus‐cancer problem will come, of course, but one of the most conservative workers in this field said in a telephone interview last week that he expected the answer to come "soon—maybe within a year.” This scientist, Dr. A. J. Dalton of the National Cancer In‐stitute in Bethesda, Md., based his optimism partly on the sudden spurt of findings linking some forms of human cancer to viruses. Another consideration was the availability now or soon of methods most likely to show whether the viruses from human cancers really can cause the disease. In fact, the burst of new find‑ ings in attempts to find out whether some human cancers are virus‐caused can be attributed largely to the development of techniques for detecting, collecting and growing viruses from human material. The current phase of the search for human cancer viruses goes back to 1960 when Dr. Leon Dmochowski of the M. D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute in Houston reported finding particles in material from human leukemia patients that were similar in appearance to viruses that cause mouse leukemia. A major problem, however, was that not enough of the viruses could be obtained for growth and experiments. This obstacle was reduced considerably in 1961 when Dr. Dalton and Dr. John B. Moloney reported the development of the techniques for collecting large quantities of mouse leukemia viruses from blood. The technique consisted of “differential centrifugation,” or spinning samples of mouse blood at high speed so that cells and tissue debris could be separated from the viruses, which would collect into a pellet. The pellet could then be fixed, sliced, stained and inspected under the electron microscope. Drs. Dalton and Moloney have used this technique on blood from human leukemia patients and, since 1961, have found viruses in about 15 per cent of the cases they have looked at. They have not published these findings yet because of past “false alarms” in reports of viruses associated with human cancer and their desire "to be sure this time.” They expect to publish their findings soon, however, as a result of reports now coming from many other laboratories. Other reports have come from Drs. June D. Almeida, Richard C. Hasselback and Arthur W. Ham of the Ontario Cancer Institute in Canada; Dr. Joseph Melnick of Baylor University; Dr. James T. Grace Jr. of Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo; and Drs. C. L. Burger, W. W. Harris, N. G. Anderson, T. W. Bartlett and R. M. Kniseley of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The most recent report came from Dr. Gavino Negroni of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London. Dr. Negroni's findings and those of Dr. Gilbert Dalldorf and Dr. Fernanda Bergamini of the Sloan‐Kettering Institute in New York, were the subject of some rather optimistic remarks last week by Dr. Frank L. Horsfall Jr., president and director of the institute, Dr. Negroni, in the April 11 issue of the British Medical Journal, which just arrived here, reported isolating a virus from the bone marrow of 10 out of 25 patients with various leukemias and none from 13 patients with other diseases. The virus was grown in tissue culture and caused damage in human embryonic cells. Drs. Dalldorf and Bergamini reported the discovery of viruses in the bone marrow and tumor tissue of six persons suffering from malignant lymphomas, cancers that afflict the jaws and abdominal organs of children and that are epidemic in an of Africa. Blood sera from New York leukemia victims appear to contain antibodies against that new virus, according to the report. Moreover, Dr. Horsfall said, the two viruses—the one from leukemia patients in England and the lymphoma patients in Africa—seem to be “closely similar, if not identical.” On the basis of these and the other reports, Dr, Horsfall said: “It would be an exciting event if an acceptable human cancer virus were at least on hand.” Some of the reports indicate an incidence of virus associated with leukemia as high as 80 per cent. The problem, however, is how to show whether the viruses are merely “associated with“ cancer or actually cause the disease. This is now being tackled by scientists who are injecting animals—monkeys mostly—and tissue cultures of human cells with the viruses that have been taken from human cancer patients. Dr. Dalton said, for example, that two species of monkeys were being given the viruses and that ways were being developed to grow in the test tube human embryonic thymus and spleen tissue against which to test the effect of the viruses. What with the new techniques of differential centrifugation and negative staining—which makes viruses more discernible with the electron microscope than earlier methods had—and the methods for testing their effects on human cells, scientists appear at last to be close to an answer of some sort. If that answer turns out to be that viruses can, indeed, cause leukemia—and possibly some other cancers—the problem then will be what to do about it. Vaccines against virus infection are possible, of course, but unless a way is found to discriminate between viruses that can cause cancer and those that cannot, there will be no way of knowing if the vaccine‐viruses themselves might produce the disease they are designed to protect against. Recently, however, indications have been reported that such a discernible difference, between tumor viruses and non tumor viruses exists. The problem would still remain of stemming the progress of infection—by tumor viruses or other kinds. As yet, virus diseases are incurable by drugs except in special cases. Signs of progress toward this end, however, are coming from laboratories around the world in which ways are being sought to kill viruses without killing healthy cells. And there would still remain a problem to solve: Whether a cell, once transformed into a ,malignant pattern of growth, can be healed by knocking out the agent that did the damage or whether a more delicate sort of subeellular “surgery” would have to be performed. There is no doubt, however, that establishing once and for all what role—if any—viruses play in human cancer would be of great importance in efforts to understand and control the disease.

839-> Sports of The Times; Old Man River
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., March 4—It is always conceivable that this could be the season Warren Spahn finally trips over his flowing white beard and comes crashing down. Don't bet on it, though. The marvel of the Milwaukee Braves, now almost 43 years old, was a 23‐game winner last season, the 13th time he's entered the exclusive 20‐Game Club. Can he do it again? “Why not?” said Bobby Bragan, his manager. “He throws with such effortless ease that he could last forever‐or almost. When you deal with him, you have to throw away all your preconceived notions about pitching and just ride with the tide. I gave up long ago any idea I ever had of trying to figure him out.” “You're absolutely right,” said Jo‐Jo White, the Braves' coach. “I defy any manager to know when to remove Spahnie from a ball game.” “He gives a manager the jitters,” said Bobby. “You will see him on the brink of disaster. Then he throws the double‐play ball and breezes.” “How about the time in Houston ?” prompted Jo‐Jo. “It was a hair‐raiser,” said Bragan. “Those Houston hitters teed off on Spahnie from the start. For two innings they hit nothing but line drives. Some were caught and some fell safely. But everything was a screamer. Then Houston filled the bases with none out and Spahnie had three balls and no strikes on Carl Warwick, a pretty clever right‐handed batter. I could wait no longer. I walked out to the mound. “‘Spahnie,’ I said, 'this doesn’t look like your night to pitch. “‘Bobby,’ he said, looking me squarely in the eye, ‘I never felt better in my life.’ “What could I do ? He was so positive he had the situation under control that I felt obligated to string along with him. I shrugged my shoulders, wished him luck and beat a hasty retreat to the dugout. “Spahnie's next two pitches were breaking stuff, a screwball and a curve for strikes. Then he came whistling in—only a Spahn would have had the gall and the skill to do it—with a fast ball down the pipe for strike three. That was one out. Damned if he didn't throw a double‐play ball and he's out of trouble for keeps. He breezed the rest of the way.” “Here's something else about the man,” the manager said. “He started 33 games and completed 22, Sandy Koufax started 40 and finished only 20. If Spahnie had not been sidelined for one stretch of 18 days—‐this was after he lost a 1‐0 game to Juan Marichal of the Giants in 16 innings—and another stretch of 15 days, his record would have been even better. He had only one bad game and it was against—of all people—the Mets. He blew an eight‐run lead although we finally won in the 10th. “It isn't the old man of my pitching staff I'm worried about. It's the young ones. Our fate is in their hands—or arms. The team as a whole has been so strengthened by our deal with the Giants that any arrival at maturity by our kid pitchers will give us a wonderful chance of going all the way to the top.” The Braves pulled a major trade with the Giants to get Felipe Alou for the vacant spot in center field, a hole that has stayed empty since Bill Bruton departed in a deal some years ago. With the swift‐moving, sure‐fielding Alou came another power hitter, Ed Bailey, the catcher. But Bob Shaw, a solid pitcher, was sacrificed along with Bob Hendley, a young pitcher, and Del Crandall, an aging catcher. “You might say,” said the light‐hearted Bragan, “that we are lousy with catchers. We have Joe Torre, the best in the business; Bailey, a left‐handed powerhouse, Gene Oliver and two highly promising kids who look just about ready, Bob Uecker and Phil Roof. Just think of the maneuverability I now have. “Torre also is as good at first base as he is behind the plate. Oliver can play first or the outfield. I could use Eddie Mathews at third or in left. Denis Menke will be a regular somewhere, either at short or at third because he came on like Gangbusters last season. Some day he'll be a third baseman in the same heroic mold as Ken Boyer. “I can juggle this platoon like crazy—or like Casey Stengel. The Braves finally have the horses, meaning that we have the power, the speed and the depth. Lee Maye came fast last year and Henry Aaron is still Henry Aaron, the best ballplayer in the league. “It will be up to the young pitchers to determine how far we go. My one old pitcher, Spahnie, can take care of himself with his usual competence. If they all were like him, I wouldn't have a care in the world.”

840-> Sports of The Times; A Golfing Rarity
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., March 12—When Harry Vardon was the reigning ruler of the links about half century ago, the brusque Britisher was told about a promising young golfer who happened to be lefthanded. “A left‐hander ?” snorted Vardon. “Never saw one who was worth a damn.” It was a summary dismissal of an outlander in a right‐handed sport. It was a reasonably accurate estimate, too. No southpaw swinger had come close to challenging golfdom's elite. A stray club championship is about the most any of these rare birds could hope to achieve. But everything is changed. Bob Charles of New Zealand, the slickest portsider ever produced in cow pasture pool, brought hope and self respect to the downtrodden minority last season. Not only did he zoom up among the top money winners, but he also won the most prized of all championships, the British Open, the great Vardon favorite dish of tea—or tee. This could start a trend among natural left‐handers. Most switch to righty when they take up golf, with Ben Hogan as a prize example. When Bantam Ben first ventured on the links, the only clubs he could afford to buy were right‐handed because left‐handed clubs were special and costly. So he resigned himself to playing right‐handed. Didn't do bacdy, either. Charles is in town for the St. Pete open, one of the stops on the winter tour. He was asked how he escaped the fate that befell Bantam Ben. “I didn't escape at all,” said the slim New Zealander. “I did the reverse because I'm naturally right‐handed as well as right‐eyed right‐footed and right everything. But my parents played left‐handed and that meant the only clubs I had available when I was a small boy were the left‐handed ones that they owned. “When I was a boy, I was very keen on cricket. Pretty fair at it I was. The strange thing is that I bowled right‐handed and batted left‐handed. Golf is a winter sport in New Zealand just as football is. We played it from March to October—our seasons are upside down, you know—and cricket was the summer sport. That's how I could engage in both.” Charles is the willowy type, a 163‐pounder who is just under 6 feet 2 inches in height, and he'll be 28 years old on Sunday. Unlike the general conception of left handers, he has control and is remarkably consistent with a superb short game. His one weakness is off the tee, because he just can't match or conic close to matching such boomers as Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. The popular impression over the years is that golf courses have been hand‐tailored for right‐handers, deliberately or otherwise, and that lefties are unduly penalized. This is entirely the opposite of the Yankee Stadium, which gives all the advantages to the southpaw swingers. Is there anything to this theory? “No as far as I ever discovered,” said the Man from Down Under. “Any pro learns to maneuver the ball. He can fade it or draw it. I am forced to believe that it all evens up over the course of a round. “Wait a minute. I can think of one exception. It's the 13th hole at Augusta in the Masters. This is the dog‐legged par‐5 and a right‐handed hitter can hook his tee shot to get around the dog leg while a lefty such as myself has to fade. Everyone knows you can get more distance with a hook than with a slice.” It was a little surprising to learn that the idol of all left‐handed golfers had played in the Masters for the first time as an amature in 1958. This year he will be one of the better attractions there as the British Open champion. He won that glittering title after he and young Phil Rodgers of the United States had tied at the end of 72 holes, the New Zealander shooting successive rounds of 68, 72, 66 and 71. In the playoff he had a 69 and a 71. “I went to work in a bank atter high school,” he said, “and saved my money. My dad gave me some more and in 1958 I spent seven months touring the United States and Europe. In 1959 the New Zealand Golf Association sent me to South Africa for the Commonwealth tournament. After I turned pro at the end of 1960 I traveled through the Far East, playing in the Philippines, Singapore, Malaya, Hong Kong and Japan. I wouldn't be surprised if I've traveled more than anyone else in the sport.” When a guy plays as well as this unusual southpaw, golf not only is broadening but profitable. His official money winnings last year were in the rather pleasant neighborhood of $28,000 with lots more coming from other sources. Most of all, though. Bob Charles has brought respectability to the left handers. Because of him they no longer feel like freaks.

842-> LITTLE NECK BAY THWARTED AGAIN; Bill to Authorize Financing of Dredging Fails to Pass
Like any good runner‐up, the Council for Little Neck Bay Reclamation and Preservation once again is saying: “Wait till next year.” It also is that state Iegislators used “penny‐wise, pound‐foolish' economic reasoning in failing to pass a bill by which the state would share with the Federal Government and the city of New York the cost of dredging the bay. After many years of delay, it had appeared this time the improvement program would be authorized for the bay, which lies a few miles to the east of Flushing Bay and the World's Fair in Queens, and is one of the metropolitan area's most crowded (and most mud‐filled) pleasure‐boat anchorages. According to the council, the bill was “swamped by a wave of fiscal juggling to balance the budget by avoiding tax increases regardless of ultimate cost.” The bill would have authorized the state to bear $1,185,000 of the total cost of the improvement program, which was estimated at $4,320,000. Federal and city aid already has been guaranteed, provided the state joins the project.

843-> Wood, Field and Stream; Suggestions for Avid Anglers on Where They Might Find Fishing in New York
EACH year at this time plaintive letters arrive begging for information about where, within a couple hours drive, an angler may find his sport. Since today is the opening day of trout season in New York State, following are some directions to places where one might expect to find some fishing. He may also expect to find some fishermen, for the sad truth is there are few if any places nearby open to the public where an angler will find solitude along with his fishing. Closest to Manhattan are the lakes and streams of upper Westchester and Putnam Counties. The Saw Mill River Parkway, which becomes Route 22, is the fastest route there. To the east of the road at the point is the Cross River Reservoir and its outlet streams, and to the west is the long New Croton Reservoir. The northern portion of this body of water is called Muscoot Reservoir around the area of Golden's Bridge. At the town of Purdys is Titicus Reservoir and north of that in Putnam County is Croton Falls Reservoir, Diverting Reservoir and the East Branch Reservoir. Right in the town of Brewster on Route 22 is the Croton River, always worth trying. On Route 35 between the Taconic Parkway and Route 22 is the Amawalk Reservoir. Its outlet is especially favored by trout fishermen. The Catskill Mountains, with their streams, lakes and reservoirs are a magnet to anglers. A last‐minute check shows water generally to be in good shape. Heading up the Route 17 Quickway, a rod waver will hit public fishing on the Wil‐ lowemoc at Livingston Manor. This water is open all the way down to Trout Brook near the junction of the East Branch of the Delaware River, which flows out of Pepacton Reservoir. If one takes Route 10 out of Deposit heading northeast past Cannonsville Reservoir and Walton, he will find open water on the West Branch of the Delaware. and the little Delaware River up to Stamford. Due west of the Ashokan Reservoir and Kingston, N. Y., there are a number of streams worth exploring. There is the Esopus Creek near Phoenicia and the East and West Branches of the Neversink River near Claryville. Taking Route 214 north from Phoenicia one will run into the Schoharie Creek and farther north the West Kill and the Batavia Kill, which form the Catskill park boundary. The best way to find fishing is simply to go looking for it. The Division of Conservation Education of the Conservation Department in Albany publishes an excellent Outdoor Recreation Map of New York that lists public land, public fishing streams, boat launching sites, public campsites, major hiking trails and special use areas. Another helpful map is the Touring and Resort Map of the Catskill region published by R. R. Von Siegl, Rhinebeck, N. Y. It costs $1.50 and is quite detailed. For a particular area, the U. S. Coast and Geodetic topographical maps are superb. A common mistake is to concentrate only on the timehonored places passing up the little brooks and streams. Very often, simply because everyone does overlook them, good fishing for smaller—sometimes larger—trout goes begging.

844-> Wood, Field and Stream: Trout Time; Throngs of Anglers Brave Brisk Weather as the Season Opens in New York
SOMERS, N. Y., April 1—The most favorable fishing conditions in recent years marked the opening day of trout season in Westchester and Putnam Counties today. The clear, sunny but brisk weather drew throngs of fishermen, with a high percentage taking fish home. Waters available to anglers in the southern portion of the state were unusually well attended. Fishermen, many of whom were youngsters on Easter vacation, marched up and down the Saw Mill River taking a heavy toll of recently stocked brook trout. At 8:30 A. M. Harold Timmeny of North Tarrytown was lacking only one brook trout for his limit of 10, all taken out of the brook‐like Saw Mill River. By midmorning two New York fishermen, Lester Newman of the Bronx and Nick Pecoraro of Brooklyn, fishing the Croton River, had a half dozen brook trout apiece. One of the best fish reported in this section went into the creel of an unidentified boy who took an 18‐inch brown trout from the outlet of the East Branch Reservoir near Brewster and promptly went home. In the same stretch of water two adults did almost as well in the morning fishing. Ronald Peters of Yonkers brought in a 16½‐inch brown trout and shortly after John Tarr of Brewster caught another that was the same in length but a little heavier. Both fish were well over two pounds in weight. Fishing in the Croton River, Paul Keindl and his uncle John, both of Yonkers, had 19 fish between them. The many lakes and streams making up the water supply system of New York City spreading across Westchester and Putnam counties were under heavy pressure throughout the day. The Croton River along Route 22 had as many as a dozen anglers in a 50‐yard stretch of water. The time‐honored angleworm was the bait that took the most fish, although fly fishermen were represented in good number. The three ‐ mile Muscoot River at Amawaik in Westchester went into its second year as a recreational fishing project with special regulations. On this stream no trout may be killed, all must be returned to the water and artificial, single‐hook lures only may be used. It was well fished, but pressure was not heavy nor was the take. The temperature at noon rose to nearly 50 degrees warming the fishing fans who had begun the day with temperatures registering in the upper 20's. Water temperatures were about 40 degrees. A State Conservation Department official, after a check across the state, said that the turnout was good but that catches had failed to live up to expectations. In the Catskill counties or Ulster and Sullivan early morning temperatures dropping to as low as 2 degrees above zero had anglers breaking ice to get their lures in the water. On the Esopus Rsiver near Phoenicia, a creel check of 125 fishermen by conservation officers showed the over‐all take to be poor. However, seven rainbow trout measuring between 17 and 22 inches were caught by lucky anglers.

845-> Sports of The Times; The Senor Discourses
SARASOTA, Fla., March 10—Two of the more substantial rewards of middle age have recently been bestowed on Alfonso Ramon Lopez, the Happy Hidalgo who manages the Chicago White Sox. He has just become a grandfather. He has just been named the director of a bank. “The grandfather business didn't worry me any,” said the merry seiior. “I knew I could let my instincts guide me. But the job of being the director of a bank was something else again. The only figures I ever had to dea: with were the ones in batting averages or percentage tables. The thought of having responsibility for huge sums of money was almost frightening. “I pondered about it for a long while and then I came up with a brilliant idea. There was one obvious solution. I would seek the advice of the greatest of all bank directors, my old pal, Casey Stengel. He is such a fiscal genius that the bank he directs in Glendale, CaIif., had to open new branches to take care of the rush of business. I dropped over to St. Pete recently to see him. “‘Case,’ I said, ‘how does a guy direct a bank ?’ “’There ain't nuthin' to it,' he said. ‘You go into the fancy meeting room and you just sit there and never open your yap. As long as you don't say nothin’ they don't know whether you're smart or dumb. When the question of a loan comes up if it's a friend of yours you vote to give it to him and if he ain't a friend you don't.' “With such . sound advice I have a feeling I will be a complete success as a bank director.“ The Gay Caballero has so much native shrewdness that the banking business won't fluster him a bit, Casey's coaching to the contrary. He has virtually rebuilt the White Sox. Jim Landis is the only holdover from the 1959 pennant winners and Al has kept his team in contention. The Sox finished second to the Yankees last year. One of his more impressive rescue jobs was the way he nudged Dave Nicholson along the road to future stardom. Nicholson is a muscular power hitter to whom the Baltimore Orioles once handed a $110,000 bonus and then gave up on him. The senor coaxed him along and Big Nick slammed 22 homers, many game-winners, although he set a major league record of 175 strike‐outs. “I expect Nick to hit 35 homers and cut down on his strike-outs,” said his confident skipper. “But he'll have to learn to wait longer for the pitch. He commits himself too soon. All the great hitters wait until the final split‐second. “Because I was a catcher myself, I could watch them operate. I've reached for the ball with my glove and I've seen Ted Williams virtually hit the ball out of my glove. He had such quick wrists he could wait that long. Stan Musial was exactly the same. They stayed with the ball so long that they've told me they actwaily have seen the bat make contact with the bail. If Nick can learn to wait like that, he'll be one of the great sluggers and hitters. Every time he swings it's a potential home run.” Along came Ed Short, the general manager of the White Sox, and the senor began to snicker. “That reminds me of something,” he said. “I used to give Nick an occasional rest after he had had a bad day or two with strikeouts. Jim Bunning fanned him two or three times and I decided to rest Nick the next day. Then Short came to me, all excited. ” ‘Is Nick playing today?’ he said. ” ‘No,’ I said. ” ‘Do you realize Don Mossi is pitching for them ?’ he said. ‘Remember the time a couple of years ago when we watched Baltimore and Detroit on an open date? Nick hit two of the longest home runs off Mossi I ever saw.' “‘That's right,’ I said. ‘Thanks, Ed, for reminding me.' “So I put Nick back in the line-up. He didn't hit even short homers off Mossi. He didn't hit anything. All he did was fan. So I grabbed Short that night. ” ‘The next time you get a bright idea, old buddy,’ I said to him, ‘I'll be grateful if you keep it to yourself.’ “ Those close friends and accomplices, Short and Lopez, made a daring deal with the Qrioles last year. They gave up Luis Aparicio and Al Smith for Ron Hansen, the unproved Nicholson and Pete Ward, an untried rookie. They were blasted for the trade, but it developed into a huge success. Now they have let go of an old standby, Nellie Fox, and gambled that Don Buford, the batting champion and most valuable player of the International League, can replace him at second. “We gave Buford special schooling this winter in Puerto Rico,” said Lopez, “on the mechanics of making the double play. His instructor was Tony Cuccinello and Cooch is a master at the art. Because he was slow of foot Cooch could make it in any of three ways. Fast men like Frank Frisch and Joe G^rdon only had to learn one way, but Cooc} learned them all. Buford has picked ut, the knack beautifully. He's a fine fielde •, he's fast and he's a switch hitter. We'l do all right. “I hate to spoil Yogi's debut as Yankee manager, but he had better keep an eye on us. The White Sox will be tough.”

847-> Sports in Europe; British at Odds Over ‘New’ Idea: There Can Be Big Money in Golf
PARIS, March 2—What the British consider to be American‐style golf will make an appearance in England next October when the socalled eight best players in the world fight it out in match play for three days at Wentworth, near Ascot. Golf in England is a quiet game. Unlike Americans, British pros usually play for piddlingpurses in tournaments untainted by com‐ mercialism or extravagance of any kind. The Wentworth tournament, however, will be commercial and extravagant — and its prize money is far from piddling. The first four players will win a total of $33,600. The money is being put up by the Carreras Tobacco Company, whose interest is not in selling golf, but in selling cigarettes. The tournament will most likely be called the match‐play world championship of golf. The eight players will be invited by Carreras. Only the four who win the first day wil1 share the prize money. The winner will get $14,000, the runner‐up $8,400 and the next two men $5,600 each. The course at Wentworth is more than 7,000 yards long. In places it virtually tunnels through the trees. Par is 75 and there are nine par‐five holes. One hole is so long, so bumpy and so difficult that it is known as “the Burma Road.” Some golf purists in Britain are outraged by the tournament. They say such a tournament will make golf into a circus and say that they have been “knocked sideways” by the news. They say the money is ridiculous, out of proportion. Most of all, the British golf world seems to resent being used to sell cigarettes. Plenty of people in Britain, however, are delighted by the tournament. It promises a kind of head‐to‐head slugging match between the best golfers of the year. Match play is altogether too rare, they say. And they say, “At the very least, the tournament will get an awful lot of smokers out into the air for a few days.” One thing all British golf‐ ers seem agreed on: The tournament ought to include 16 golfers at least. If it stays limited to eight, no British pro will get invited. At 16, one or more might be. No other British tournament of any kind gives away such money as this one, and British pros ought to have a shot at it. they say. The tournament will probably be played from Oct. 8 through 10. Meanwhile, the Royal Birkdale course is undergoing nearly $100,000 worth of improvements at this time. When finished, it seems sure to rank as Britain's No. 1 course. The clubhouse is being modernized and new Iocker rooms installed. Previously, the course killed a hooker stone dead, but let slicers get away virtually free. The alterations will kill one as dead as the the other. Also, short holes have been altered to provide more variety and so have several doglegs. Royal Birkdale will be the site of the British Masters this year and of the British Open and Ryder Cup matches next year. Its huge sandhills make splendid grandstands for the galleries. It has been said that more spectators can see more golf from these dunes than from any other natural vantage point in golf. Now passages are being nade through the dunes so that the crowds can flow smoothly from one hole to the next. •Golf, French style, is something else again. A new course will open in August between Hyeres and Le Lavandou on the Riviera. The trees that line the fairways are mimosas and olive trees, and vineyards stretch away into the distance. The course is owned by the Societe Frangois Leredu. Leredu plans to build four tennis courts, a pool, 25 miles of trails for horseback riding and numerous bungalows and villas. Most new French golf courses—and there are several new ones each year—are like this. They are basically real‐estate deals, with a golf course in the center like a magnet. To buy a house overlooking the course, or to join a club as a golfer, you must buy stock in the company. This usually costs a minimum of $2,000,

848-> VIETNAMESE TROOPS BATTERED IN AMBUSH
SAIGON, South Vietnam, March 18 (UPI)—Communist forces ba,ttored Government troops today in a daylight ambush 50 miles south of here. A Vietcong battalion of 600 men attacked a group of 300 Vietnamese regulars. Preliminary reports indicated the Government forces suffereci at least 6 men killed and 26 wounded, with an undetermined number missing. Communist losses, if any, were not known. The Government troops were convoying a supply mission to Ba Than when the guerrillas ambushed themi just south of the provincial capital of Kien Hoa. The guerrilles were believed to have captured a supply of weapons. The attack was di??sed shortly after Mai. Gen. Nguyen Khanh pledged to m??e the population for the anti‐guewar. Premier Khanhthreatened to shoot or imprison slackers. He said thre were two South Vietnanls–the countryside where people we're fighting and dying every day in the battle against the communists, and Saigon, where he said ists, and Saigon where, he said.

849-> Wood, Field and Stream; Jersey Trout Season to Open Saturday —Some Hints Are Offered to Anglers
ROUT addicts who survived the cold of last weekend will have another opportunity on Saturday and Sunday to prove their worth on the waters. New Jersey will be opening its season on Saturday with streams well stocked with hatchery trout. There are, perhaps, some newcomers to this business of removing trout from streams and lakes. They may be wondering about the most effective ways of accomplishing the trick of transferring a trout from the hazards of water to the safety of a creel. The terrible truth is, a worm is the most effective single bait. It is not at all esthetic, but for early season angling, it is the most effective. But fishing with a worm is not the most satisfying method of angling. With a worm one merely splashes the bait out in the water, lets it roll along, or lie on the bottom until a fish happens along to bite it, thus impaling itself on a hook. For a good fisherman, the art of nymphing is far more satisfying and quite effective. To fish a nymph he has to know a little about how fish take food and how natural nymphs behave in the stream. A nymph, of course, is the immature, pre‐adult stage of an insect, and a major food item for trout. The fish pick them off the bottom, from the rocks to which they cling, out of the mud and silt, and from the water as they float along. An artificial nymph can be deadly, but it should be fished in an appropriate manner. This is often accomplished by casting across stream, using a sinking line—the faster sinking the better. As the current pulls the line tight, retrieve it in quick little jerks. If one is fishing a quiet pool with a sluggish current, it is best to drift the nymph down into the pool, let it settle to the bottom and then bring it in slowly with short pulls of the line. A trout hitting a nymph often does so without fuss or fanfare, and the angler should be alert for the strike that often may be just a little bump. The trout is usually not a complete idiot, and if he gets a chance to mouth the artificial, he ejects it almost as fast as he takes it in. March Browns are particularly good nymphs at this time of year, and any of the caddis fly imitations also are good producers. Streamers are a time honored lure, and for early season fishing, often take larger trout who prefer to feed on other fish. A streamer is fished in such a way as to imitate the swimming of a minnow. This is best done by casting across stream, imparting motion to the streamer by lifting the rod tin. As the angler wades down stream, he can cover a great deal of water by casting to his left, working the streamer until his line is stretched out straight downstream. His next cast should be to the right, again until the line is straight out. After a few casts like this he then should move a few steps downstream. In this way he will be presenting his streamer over the widest possible area. Everyone has his favorites, and this corner leans to a Golden Darter, for no other reason than that it catches fish. A marabou is also excellent.

850-> LETTERS; WHITE COLLARS
TO THE EDITOR: For many years, I have been active in a trade union attempting to organize white‐ collar civil servants. I imagine I always sensed why the job has been so difficult and the going so rough. But when I read the article by Professor Hacker, I saw that he had expressed it incisively and clearly: “Conservatives identify with management, and visualize their own promotions and raises as due to their unique qualifications.” Substitute the words “whitecollar workers” for tives” and therein lies the answer to the inability of the trade unions really to organize this group.

852-> ROYAL DUTCH PLANS EXPANSION IN ITALY
ROME, April 15—The Royal Dutch‐Shell Group will invest about $300 million in the Italian economy over a period of at least three years, Diego Guicciardi, president of Shell‐Italiana, said today. Mr. Guicciardi told a news conference in Taranto that this investment was a “positive element for the Italian economy.” Plans for a 25 billion lire ($40 million) oil refinery were disclosed at the news conference. Work on the refinery, expected to have a capacity of 3 million tons a year, will start as Shell takes over its 370‐acre Taranto site not far from where Italy's largest steel mill is now being built. The refinery is expected to be finished by the end of 1966. Shell spokesman in Rome said the $300 million figure includes Shell's participation in Montecatini, he expansion of Shell's distribution network in Italy and enlargement of its storing capacities. It also includes the Taranto refinery that will bring to three the number of Shell refineries in Italy. The other two refineries are at La Spezia and Rho in northern Italy.

853-> POPE PAUL RECEIVES ORTHODOX PRELATE
ROME, Jan. 16—PopePaul VI today received two Greek Orthodox churchmen, one bearing a message from Patriach Athenagoras I, spiritual leader of Eastern Orthodoxy. The message, carried by Metropolitan Athenagoras of Thiatyron, Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Britain, expressed the Patriarch's “joy and gratitude” over his meetings with the Pope in the Holy Land. Metropolitan Athenagoras, who later went on to London, was accompanied by Metropolitan Maximos of Laodicea. Maximos, who was passing through Rome on his way to Istanbul from Germany, had expressed a desire to pay his respects to the Pope The visit lasted a little more than half an hour. Vatican sources said there was some general discussion of Christian unity. The sources said the “next move” was being taken by the Orthodox Patriarch, who was believed to be “sifting the reaction of the synods” to his meeting with the Pope. At the same time, the Pope is expected to sound out the Cardinals.

854-> Politics or Principles?
The Board of Education has issued to Dr. Calvin E. Gross, the Superintendent of Schools, a set of new “guiding principles” for speedier integration. For the most part, these recommendations differ only in terminology and in scope from those contained in Dr. Gross's “interim report,” transmitted by the Superintendent to the board on Dec. 9. With the exception of mandatory transfers of pupils from overcrowded schools in slum areas to underutilized schools elsewhere, most of the board's specific devices—such as joint school zones (Princeton Plan)—were contained in the Superintendent's report. However, Dr. Gross urged that, as a starter, a number of selected schools be singled out for the program next fall, before large‐scale organization changes were attempted. He considered this essential to avoid educational chaos. The board is entirely within its province in mapping out policy. But the manner in which the board has acted is open to the most serious question. Directing Dr. Gross to submit a tentative outline of far‐reaching zone changes by this Friday smacks of a panicky ultimatum. Dr. Gross issued his report 43 days ago. At the time the board offered no indication of dissatisfaction. Individual board members expressed consent. James B. Donovan, the board's new president, gave public indication that he did not want to see action taken which might endanger the education process itself. Why, then, has the board waited so long before ordering the Superintendent to carry out a more sweeping mandate? Why has the board thus permitted the impression to be created that Dr. Gross is softer on integration than the board itself? It is difficult not to suspect that political rather than educational considerations have motivated the board's sudden action. Dr. Gross has been attacked by some civil rights leaders for proposing what they consider “piecemeal” integration. The board, perhaps in an effort to ward off a boycott, now has ordered him to make the plan “citywide.” Such terms easily turn into slogans. “Citywide” integration will be interpreted by some to mean that all the city's schools must be integrated—an impossible target given the composition of New York's population and housing. Solution of a desperate social and educational issue calls for an end to sloganeering and politicstinged maneuvering. It requires instead the courage to face up to a need for orderly and costly changes, with a view to the children's future rather than to the promise of short‐lived popularity.

855-> N.B.C.'s Beautiful ‘American Spectacle’
TO those of us who view our vast land as a challenge to find a place where you can park a car, the National Broadcasting Company delivered a stunningly beautiful spectacle last night. The show, “American Spectacle,” surely some of the most radiant color‐film footage shown on television, took the viewer for a tour of the natural beauties of the United States, from Cape Cod to Hawaii, from Louisiana to Alaska. It is a shame that so much color was lost in blackand‐white receivers. Lou Hazam, the hour's producer and writer, combined a subjective, enthusiastic narration, feelingly delivered by Van Heflin, with a wide‐eyed camera view of the mighty and the trivial in American nature. The lens reveled in shots of water, the cascading cream of Niagara, the gentle patter of raindrops on a lake in Yosemite, the torrential rapids of Idaho's Salmon River and the awesome giant flaking of a glacier into a wild‐running Alaskan river. The mountains, canyons, plains, prairies and deserts were visited. People appeared only when necessary to show the size of nature. The large shadow of a plane on the bare ground ’ suddenly growing small as the craft flew over a 1,500‐foot‐deep meteor crater was startling. The program ended with the devilishly brilliant upheaval of Kalauea. Tom Priestly, the director, and Scott Berner, photographer, with the staff of cameramen, caught all of this profusion in sure, leisurely shots that did not make a viewer feel that he was being hustled from one end of the program to the other. Eddy Manson's musical score captured and contributed to the mood. It was an unusual travel program, one that did not seek to communicate information as much as a sense of greathess. Its message, at the end, was a worthy one: Preserve these wonders. “Paradise lost can never be regained.”

856-> N.B.C. EXPECTING PAAR TO RETURN; Network and Agent Talking of Terms for Next Season
The National Broadcasting Company has started discussions with Jack Paar's agent about terms under which the performer might continue on television next season. Recently there nas been indication that Mr. Paar is reconsidering his decision of last December not to appear on television in the 1964‐65 season, although under contract to N.B.C. At that time he criticized N.B.C. for not giving him a more favorable time period and for scheduling a weak show ahead of his. A spokesman for N.B.C. said yesterday that company representatives were meeting with Martin H. Kummer, agent for Mr. Paar. Despite Mr. Paar's “irrevocable decision,” the spokesman said, the network still expects him back next fall. Yesterday an advertising agency official involved with the Paar show met with the agent and said later he was “very encouraged” about the possibility the entertainer would continue his show. “Two weeks ago Jack led me to believe he would not come back, but now I think he may be back next fall,” said Nicholas E. Keesely, senior vice president of television and radio for Lennen & Newell. Inc. disclosed it had decided to schedule Jack Benny's show next season on Fridays from 9:30 to 10 P.M., immediately ahead of the Paar show. It is understood Mr. Paar was favorably impressed. Mr. Benny put Mr. Paar on network radio years ago as his summer replacement. Fred W. Friendly, who was appointed president of Columbia Broadcasting System News on Monday, has assigned a 13man news crew to Southeast Asia to prepare a one‐hour report, “vietnam: The Deadly Decision.” He said it would present “a tough, comprehensive and uncompromising look at one of the United States' most difficult military situations since South Korea.” The report will include coverage of the activities of the United States mission to Vietnam headed by Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, who left Washington for Saigon yesterday. Correspondents on the program, which will be televised on April 1 at 7:30 P.M., will be CharIes Collingwood, Peter Kalischer and Bernard KaIb * C.B.S., in issuing a formal announcement that Lucille Ball would continue on television next season, said her show would be presented at a later hour, from 9 to 9:30 P.M. on Mondays. “The Andy Griffith Show,” now televised at that hour, will move up to 8:30. It was reported that Charles C. Barry, a vice presi‐ dent of the Young & Rubicam advertising agency, which represents a sponsor of “The Lucy Show,” was influential in getting Miss BaIl to continue the program. Beginning March 30, WNBC radio will eliminate its disk jockey shows, with one exception. and switch to a format of conversation and interviews. Theonly program that will continue to present recorded music is “The Big Wilson Show, from 6 to10 A.M. The station is hiring seven or eight performers to conduct the taIk shows, which will vary in length from two to five hours. Some program hosts will engage in telephone conversations with listeners. Brad Crandall, a newcomer from Toronto, will have a show from 7:45 P.M. to midnight, Mondays through Fridays. Mimi Benzell will present an interview show trom noon to 2 P.M.

857-> LEONIE RYSANEK SAYS GOING MAD IS EASY
LEONIE RYSANEK, the Viennese soprano, will add the role of Elsa in Wagrier's “Lohengrin” to her Metropolitan Opera repertory on Tuesday. Since her debut here five years ago as Lady Macbeth in Verdi's “Macbeth,” she has won acclaim there for her characterizations of Aida, Ariadne, Amelia, Abigaille and Senta among others. During this summer's Vienna Festival, she will take part in Austria's plans to celebrate the 100th birthday of a former conductor and manager of the Vienna Opera, Richard Strauss. Herbert von Karajan, the present conductor‐manager, will lead his new production of Strauss' “Die Frau Ohne Schatten,” with Miss Rysanek singing the Empress on June 11. It is a role she has done often in Europe, where she has sung some 50 parts. It is one of her favorites. She spoke excitedly about the production at a recent interview at her hotel on Central Park West. She was wearing a black‐and‐gray wool suit with her ash‐blond hair piled high on her head. Her voice lilted as she spoke, her blue, almost violet eyes narrowing or widening with expression, and her hands describing huge arcs or tiny gestures. Gold earrings, bracelets, rings and a scatter pin caught the light. “I go to Vienna for my first rehearsal with von Karajan March 23,” she said. Since the performance was not until June 11, the early beginning was questioned. The answer was surprising but simple. “When he does a new production, he believes in unlimited rehearsals; he controls every element from lights and costumes to staging and final performance. Why, once he called 62 lighting rehearsals for a ‘Götterdämmerung.’ And his lighting . . . ” Here a kiss was wafted into the air. “He is so dynamic in the theater,” she continued. “But alone, he is a simple, sweet, gentle man. When I first met him, I was singing a 'Walküre' in Stuttgart for Wieland Wagner, another wonderful man. Von Karajan wanted me for his production of it in Vienna, so he sent his private car to Stuttgart, picked me up after the performance, and I rode all night in my costume and make‐up so I could make the rehearsal in Vienna in the morning.” Miss Rysanek, who is Mrs. Rudolf Grossman in private life, made her debut at Innsbruck when she was 19. It was there she met her husband, who was a baritone then, and who became, and still is, her voice teacher. Miss Rysanek, a graduate of the Austrian State Academy for Dramatic Arts, expressed definite Ideas about the fusion of singing and acting in operatic performance. “Two things are easy,” she said. “To die, and to go mad. They are both very rewarding, but how much more difficult it is to act Senta than Lady Macbeth. Senta sits there in the second act of 'Der Fliegende Holländer,' while the women spin and she is motionless. But she must show her love and determination. And there is no vocal preparation for that high pianissimo A she must begin with. I am always very nervous throughout the waiting. In a way, every performance is like a championship fight. Sometimes that opening A is not quite right, but when you have a good technique, the voice warms up and you get better. If it is a bad one, you only get hoarse. “Singing at the Met is different from other houses. You act the same way, but you never get used to not hearing yourself. You sing a note, and it goes Doop!” Here her right hand executed a nosedive into her lap. “You never hear it come back. This makes some singers push, which is wrong. A sweet soaring pianissimo can fill the house. Of course that doesn't come back either. “When I sing my part, I carry the other parts mentally. I do not rely on cues. I try never to look at the prompter or conductor but I listen to the orchestra for everything. You know a conductor can get off, but not a whole orchestra.” Miss Rysanek hoped the acoustics at the new Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center would be kinder with its reverberations, and she mentioned that Mr. Bing promised her he would do a “Frau ohne Schatten” for her there. Besides these, her plans include a Soviet tour during the 1966‐67 season, including appearances at the Moscow and Leningrad opera houses singing in “Waiküre,” “TosCa,” “Fidelio,” “Otello” and “Masked Ball.” Her tour is unusual, because it has been arranged independently from any cultural exchange, and her fees will be paid in either Austrian or United States currency.

858-> Pope and Patriarch
The history of religion has been enriched by many significant and dramatic pages since Pope John XXIII first set the vast mechanism of the Roman Catholic Church in motion in 1959 with his plans for the Second Vatican Council. Aside from the chapter that Pope Paul VI's trip to the Holy Land this weekend will provide, there is the fascinating sidelight of the coming together for the first time in 500 years of the heads of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. This is to take place in Jerusalem during Pope Paul's trip. How extraordinary it is that a “dialogue” (to use Cardinal Bea's captivating word) that was interrupted during Pope Eugene IV's reign (1431‐47) should be picked up, as if a day had passed, in 1964! While Eugene was Supreme Pontiff a “witch” was burned in the market place of Rouen. Her name was Joan of Arc—Saint Joan to the Roman Catholics of the twentieth century. Pope Eugene worked for years on the reunion of the schismatic churches of the East—Greek, Armenian and Jacobite. Pope John, and now Pope Paul, resumed the work. There is perhaps no more likelihood of healing the schism today, even under the menace of Communist power, than there was in Eugene's time when Islam was inexorably moving northward into Europe. Yet the meeting between Pope Paul VI and Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I will certainly not be in vain. Just as a symbol of friendliness and understanding between the two largest churches in the Christian community it will have importance. It surely will not take another 500 years to make progress, but if it should, the “dialogue” could be resumed.

860-> Legislature Tightens Controls On Its Keys After Some Stray
ALBANY, March 9—Tighter security has been imposed to protect the offices of State Senators and Assemblymen because a lobbyist was found to have had keys to some of the rooms. Walter J. Mahoney, Republican majority leader in the Senate, said today that he had ordered stricter controls after receiving a report from the state police about the activities of the lobbyist. The police identified him as Nicholas M. Kisburg, legislative director of Joint Council 16 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in New York City. The police said that Mr. Kisburg “in the past had ready access to and keys to Room 518, the offices of former Senator James Lopez Watson,” in the Capitol Building. Mr. Watson, a Manhattan Democrat, resigned from the Senate in Jan. uary after he was elected a judge of the Civil Court. Judge Watson explained today in New York City that hehad given the keys to Mr. Kisburg when the lobbyist left his hat and coat in Mr. Watson's office. “I don't know what all the fuss is about. There was nothing secret in my office,” he said. “Lots of people have keys, including clerks and cleaning women.” Judge Watson denied that he had given Mr. Kisburg “a key to keep,” and said that he had only let him have a key temporarily to retrieve his hat and coat at times when Mr. Watson was busy on the floor of the Senate. Senator Mahoney said the police indicated that Mr. Kisburg had other keys, but “they are not certain how many or to what offices they gave access.” The Senate majority leader said locks on the doors of all Senate offices would be changed and stricter laws governing lobbyists would be enacted. Assembly Speaker Joseph F. Carlino said that a closer check would be made on persons entering the Capitol Building after hours but that he knew of no reason to install new locks on the offices of Assemblymen. How an undentified lobbyist let himself and a companion into the office of a Senator at 2 o'clock one morning last month — after Judge Watson had left to take his new post —was reported Feb. 19 in The New York Times. The lobbyist boasted to Charles Grutzner, a Times reporter that he also had keys to nine other legislators' offices. Senator Mahoney asked the State Police to investigate the report. He issued today for publication a letter from Arthur Cornelius Jr., Superintendent of the State Police, summarizing the results of the investigation. Mr. Mahoney refused to make public the full report, “because much of it is hearsay and unfair to innocent people.” The Senate majority leader referred to the episode as a “disgraceful incident.” Any keys Mr. Kisburg might have, he said, “would now be useless, and whatever value he had to his organization as far as the Senate is concerned would now be minimal.” Mr. Kisburg has denied publicly that he was the lobbyist who figured in The Times's news account. There is no rule, Senator Mahoney went on, against a Senator's giving a key to his office to anotherperson. “But I think it a most unwise use of public property,” he asserted. In the future, he said, keys to Senate offices will have to be signed for when they are issued and returned, and Senators who retire will be required to return their office keys. A tighter guard will be placed at the entrances to the Capitol Building to keep unauthorized persons out after regular business hours, he said. In the past persons who are in the building regularly and are known to the staff, including lobbyists, seldom have been chalIenged at any hour. Senator Mahoney told reporters that he expected “to materially strengthen laws regarding lobbyists” and would “have some suggestions within a few days.” In their report to Senator Mahoney, the State Police said the early‐morning visit by Mr. Kisburg with Mr. Grutzner to the Capitol Building “apparently occurred on the night of Feb. 3‐4, '64, a Monday and Tuesday.” “Marcus Kisburg, also known as Nicholas Mark Kisburg, was apparently the lobbyist,” the police reported. They noted that Mr. Kisburg was not a registered lobbyist. An aide to Senator Mahoney explained that under state law Mr. Kisburg was not required to register, since he was a member of the Teamsters Union as well as its legislative director. “The office into which Kisburg took Grutzner is not known,” the police stated. “The office apparently was on the fifth floor of the Capitol.” they added. Mr. Grutzner was questioned by the state police about the incident, but he refused to identify the lobbyist. He reported the incident in an article about how lobbyists operate that was published under the headline: “Liquor Lobbyists Ready to Mass in Albany to Fight Law Revision.” “There is no specific check on or control of use of keys to Senate offices,” the State Police said, “and they are available through the day without a checkout or other system of control, nor is it entirely known who has such keys.”

862-> LEOPOLD GLUSHAK, PLASTIC SURGEON; Zionist Leader and Amateur Singer Is Dead at 75
Dr. Leopold I. Glushak, a plastic surgeon and specialist in diseases of the eye, ear and throat, died at his honie at 1 West 85th Street yesterday. He was 75 years old. Dr. Glushak had been a member of the staff of the Hospital for Joint Diseases for more than 30 years. He was chief of clinic and an attending specialist when he retired in 1957. He had also been chief plastic surgeon at Stuyvesant Polyclinic Hospital, an otolaryngologist at New York Post‐Graduate Hospital, and an assistant clinical professor at the New York University Medical Center. Dr. Glushak was born in Werro, Estonia, spent his boyhood in England, adolescence in South Africa, and college years in Scotland—all in following the wanderlust of his father, a cantor in various synagogues Dr. Glushak came to this country in 1913 and established, his first practice in Washing‐, ton, where he joined the faculty of the Georgetown University Medical School. Dr. Glushak maintained the, family tradition with a tenor voice that was often heard at medical conventions, charitable operatic performances, and musicales at his home. During World War I, while Dr. Glushak was studying at the Army Medical School in Washington, he once went to the rescue of the Washington Opera Company, taking the Canio role in “Pagliacci” when a regular performer could not make it. The critical acclaim was such that Dr. Glushak returned as Fatist and sang the role for five performances before returning to Europe for additional medical study.

865-> RUBY SANITY TRIAL IS WON BY DEFENSE; His ‘Mind Is Falling Apart,’ Lawyers Tell Court
DALLAS, April 27 (AP)—Jack L. Ruby, described by his lawyers as a man whose “mind is falling apart,” will get a jury trial to determine if he is insane and should be committed to a mental hospital. In response to a request for a sanity trial filed by Mrs. Eva Grant, Ruby's sister, Judge Joe B. Brown said he would begin empaneling a jury at the first suitable date. Texas law requires that a judge hold such a trial if the defense asks for it. Ruby, 53 years old, banged his head against a cell wall yesterday. He appeared pale and shaky at a hearing today. An abrasion the size of a half‐dollar could be seen on the top of his head. A psychiatrist testified that Ruby convicted as the slayer of Lee H. Oswald, accused assassin of President Kennedy, believed his crime would cause the slaughter of 25 million American Jews. A 1963 estimate of the number of Jews in the United States placed the total at 5.5 million. Ruby believes he is “the Jew responsible” for the imagined slaughter, the psychiatrist, Dr. Louis J. West, said, adding that such hallucinations triggered his apparent suicide attempt yesterday. Joe Tonahill, defense lawyer, said Ruby had tried to fight him earlier today. The hearing toaay was on a defense motion that Ruby be immediately hospitalized for mental treatment. Judge Brown denied it. Mr. Tonahill said Ruby's mental state was “worse than it has ever been.” “We've got to get that boy to a hospital before he permanently injures himself,” he said. It will be incumbent on the defense at the sanity trial to prove Ruby is insane. If he is sent to a state institution as insance, and if state hospital doctors decide later Ruby has regained his sanity, another sanity trial would be required to legally confirm it, Assistant District Attorney Bill Alexander said. The next immediate development in the Ruby case will come Wednesday, at a hearing on a motion for a new trial on the murder charge. The defense has issued 36 subpoenas for evidence and witnesses. Dr. West, professor of psychiatry at the University of Oklahoma, said at today's hearin that Ruby was “obviously psyohotic and should be hospitalized immediately” Dr. West exa mined Ruby yesterday and today. Ruby was sentenced to death in the electric chair March 14 for the shooting of Oswald Nov. 24, two days after the assassination of President Kennedy.

868-> EARNINGS RECORD SET BY LOCKHEED; Income Rises 16% Above '62—Sales Also at Mark
The Lockheed Aircraft Corporation had thehighest sales and earnings iri its 32‐yearhistory, according to the 1963 annualreport issued yesterday. Net income rose ’16 per cent to $43,254,000 from the record net of $37,199,000 in 1962.The 193 net is equal to $4.06 a share compared with $3.57 a share .the year before, adjusted for the four‐for‐three stock split last year. The net income for 1962 excludes a net gain of $13,135,000,. equal to $1.26 a share, resulting from disposition of Transamerica preferred cfn,.ti Sales increased 10 per cent to $1,930,488,000 from the 1962 volume of $1,753,074,000, a previousmark, set in 1962. These include costs and fees under cost reimbursement‐type contracts. Aircraft volume of $1.05 billion, 54 per cent of total sales, involved five major programs—C‐130, C‐141, F‐104, P-3 and A‐11—but the dollar volume contributed by the individual types was not given. Missile Activities . Missile and space activities remained relatively stable, but sales dipped to $802 million from $824 million in 1962. Missile sales were up slightly to $478 million for about 25 per cent of the company's 1963 total. Electronics, shipbuilding, propulsion and other sales rose slightly to $78 million,or 4 per centof thecorporate total. Sales to United States defense agencies accounted for 90 per cent of the 1963 total; foreign governments, 5 per cent; United States civilian agencies, 3 per cent, and commercial, 2 per cent. Research and development expenditures increased to $22.8 millionfrom $18.3 million in 1962, while additions to property plant and equipment dipped to $27.5 million from $29.1 million. Courtland S. Gross, chairman, and Daniel J. Haughton, president, in the report to shareholders,said the proposed lower Federal spending for defense, hardware, research and development was influencing company sales forecasts. They expected 1964 volume to compare with 1962 sales of $1,753,100,000, second largest on record. Republic Aviation Consolidated sales of the Republic Aviation Corporation last year increased 22 per cent above 1962, but earnirigs de clined by 39 per cent, according to the annual report re leased today. Net income for 1963 amounted” to $3,607,377, equal to $1.27 a share, compared with $5,942,- i 406, or $2.08 a common sharer: ea.rned the vear before. Sales fell to $361,952,806 from the 1962 volume of $295,766,431. The backlog of unfilled orders on last Dec. 31, totaled $270 million compared with $570 million a yeai earlier. 3 Mundy I, Peale, president, indicated that the profit decline reflected in part the costly research and development program and “the compelling need to engage in cost‐sharing arrangements with the Government, which have a strong influence upon earnings.”

869-> ROWAN SAYS U.S.I.A. IS SUBSIDIZING BOOKS
WASHINGTON, April 29 (AP)—Carl T. Rowan, director of the United States Information Agency, said today that the agency secretly subsidized some books to help present the American view but not to propagandize Americans at home. Mr. Rowan defended U.S.I.A.'s book‐subsidy program at a National Press Club luncheon held shortly after a House Appropriations subcommittee published hearings on funds for the agency. The testimony showed that the agency had invested $14,952 in an anti‐Communist book reported to be on sale in this country and overseas without any indication of Government subsidy. The book was not identified. The subcommittee, headed, by Representative John J. Rooney, Democrat of Brooklyn, also disclosed that U.S.I.A. money went into a book critical of Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba, a book on the United States Social Security program and others. The agency sought. an increase to $195,000 from $90,000 in its appropriation for this book program, which has been carried on for a number of years. By law, the information agency is supposed to confine its propaganda to areas outside the United States.

PATIENCE: When there is a bright blue sky and spice in the air gardeners are tempted to go outdoors and begin. But be not hasty. Remember, in the past, March has had its fair share of snowstorms, and much of the ground is still patched wwith old snow. Tree and sirub buds are tucked very securely in their protective scales. Only the bravest bulbs have dared to bloom—a few crocuses in sunny spots, the saucy winter aconites and the perky snowdrops. Grapevines, trees and shrubs can be pruned now, but pruning of rosebushes is postponed until the buds break. Then winterkill is evident. Hydrangea, buddleia, rose of Sharon and franklinia bloom in late summer. These can be pruned now, if the gardener is looking for another excuse to be outdoors, but later spring pruning is fine. Be patient for a few more weeks. There will be many bright spring days to do all those chores even though they seem insurmountable from this side of the calendar. SEED SHOPPERS: Labels are the most important part of the box or bag of grass seed. The information supplied is required by Federal law for the protection of the consumer. Grass seed packaging must include information on kind and variety, purity, germination rate and weed seed. The percentage of each kind of seed present must be indicated. Germination rates should note the date when the seed was tested. This date should be no more than six months prior to shipment across a state line. Percentage of weed seed and inert matter must be shown. Certain noxious weed seed for individual states is controlled and lawn seed packages cannot exceed the permissable limits set by each state The Federal Seed Act is administered by the United States Department of Agriculture through its Agricultural Marketing Service. Vegetable seed labeling requires the name and address of the shipper as well as specified germination standards. For example, tomato seed must have a germination rate of 75 per cent and carrot seed 55 per cent. If the germination rates are below this, the label must say so. WHITE “FORSYTHIA”: More and more comment is being made about the white “forsythia” (Abeliophyllum distichum) which blooms with the common forsythia. Though not truly a forsythia in the botanical sense, abeliophyllum is a close cousin to forsythia with strong family ties. Both plants are part of the olive family along with other popular shrubs —lilac and privet—and the fringe tree. The abeliophyllum flowers are like those of forsythia, only white. The shrub's foliage resembles that of glossy abelia hence its botanical name. This white “forsythia” is a small shrub growing to three feet in height. It prospers well in average soil and requires moderate pruning every few years to keep it in line. Since flowers are borne on last year's wood, all pruning should be delayed until the flowers have faded. JUICY FRUIT: The tomato clan has several important vegetables—potato and eggplant—plus the tomato itself. Costa Rica is growing another member of the clan that may prove to be a juicy favorite with Americans. The fruit is called naranjilla (pronounced na‐ranhee‐ya) which means little orange. The pulp is seedy but juicy with a flavor somewhat between apricot and pineapple. When seed and skins are removed from the pulp, water and sweetener are added to give the juice a delightful flavor. The New York State Experiment Station at Geneva is processing some of the fruit and combining it with apple juice in an effort to formulate a marketable product for the consumer market. Costa Rican farmers and coffee exporters are diversifying their crop with this fruit. Over a thousand acres of naranjilla have been planted since 1960 and annual production reaches 4,500 tons.

To complete her projected flight around the world, she has to fly only from Oakland, Calif., to Columbus, Ohio. She would then become the first woman to fly solo around the world. She also hopes to establish a speed record for such a flight in an aircraft weighing less than 3,850 pounds. When Mrs. Mock touched down at Oakland Airport at 1:05 P.M. she had two records. She was the first woman to fly alone across the Pacific from West to East and the first woman to fly a single‐engine plane in either direction across the world's largest ocean. Mrs. Mock received hugs, kisses and an orchid corsage at the Oakland Airport from her husband, Russell, a Columbus advertising man. Mr. Mock and a friend own the 11‐year‐old Cessna 180.

878-> LEGISLATURE GETS GRAND JURY BILL; Measure Restores Right to Issue Presentments, but Protects Individuals; SENT TO THE ASSEMBLY; Key Provision Establishes a Procedure for Appeals to Prevent Publication
ALBANY, March 4—A new version of the controversial grand jury prese ntment bill was sent to the Assembly floor today. The measure still would restore the right of grand juries to issue reports on misconduct by public officers or other public employes. But it would permit a person against whom a critical report had been prepared to go into court to try to prevent the reports being made public. Grand jury reports, or presentments, have not been permitted in the state since 1961, when the State Court of Appeals held 4 to 3 that a grand jury must either hand up an indictment after its investigation or remain silent. Since then the Legislature has been grappling with the problem of restoring the right of the people to know about misconduct by public. officials. "We think we have a measure that will satisfy both the proponents and opponents of previous bills," said Assemblyman Daniel Becker of Newburgh, a sponsor of the measure. Under the bill, a grand jury could criticize a public official or employe only if its main purpose was to recommend remedial administrative action. It could, for example, issue a report saying that though the public official had committed no criminal action calling for indictment, his conduct was such that he should be removed from or otherwise disciplined. In this case it would name the official. The grand jury also could recommend that the local or state government take action to clear up some scandalous situation such as hazardous slum buildings or gambling. In this case it would not name any individuals. The bill, co‐sponsored by Sen ator MacNeil Mitchell, Republican of Manhattan, also provides that a grand jury can issue a report exonerating a person of charges of misconduct if it finds no misconduct and if the person involved requests public exoneration. The key amendment establishes a procedure permitting a person against whom a critical presentment has been prepared to go into the Appellate Division to try to get it quashed. The individual, who must be notified of the impending presentment. can petition the Appellate Division to examine the grand jury minutes and determine whether sufficient evidence has been presented to warrant the issuance of a public report critical of the appellant. If the Appellate Division finds no justification for making the report public, the report is withheld. On the other hand, if the grand jury believes that the court that impaneled it is unreasonably holding up the publication of a presentment, it can petition the Appellate Division to order it made public. All proceedings before the Appellate Division in these cases would remain secret.

880-> Puerto Ricans Plan Self-Help Program; Puerto Rican Leaders Present Outline for Self-Help Program
A $3‐million‐a‐year program to help the city's Puerto Ricans lift themselves out of a “poverty trap” has been drawn up by 35 leaders of the Puerto Rican community and submitted to the city administration. The leadership group asserted that “nearly half of all Puerto Rican families are actually in a state of poverty,” pointing out that the median income in the 1960 census was $3,811. With automation increasing and opportunities for unskilled labor decreasing, the group said that “we are in danger of seeing the Puerto Rican permanently relegated to an indigent poor status.” The proposal would promote citywide programs, some by ex‐ isting organizations, and new efforts in seven neighborhoods containing 60 to 65 per cent of the city's Puerto Ricans. These programs would be coordinated by the new Puerto Rican Council for Economic and Social Development. The aims would, be to raise family income and educational levels and to strengthen familylife and community organizations. The program has been led by the Puerto Rican Forum, of which Dr. Francisco Trilla, a physician, is chairman. The forum called together 35 Puerto Rican leaders to consider a city report on youth problems by the Institute of Public Administration. With a $4,000 foundation grant, the leaders drew up the plan over the last four months and submitted it last Friday to City Council President Paul R. Sorevane, coordinator of the city's war against poverty. “The leaders have also started an initial effort to feel out the South Bronx community. This effort is led by Manuel Diaz of Mobilization for Youth, as a volunteer, and Roland Cintron as a staff member. The city was asked to help in financing the program and in obtaining contributions from the Federal Government and private foundations. Half of the $3 million sought would be to strengthen citywide organizations, the rest for neighborhood projects. The group's report estimated that the city had more than 700,000 Puerto Ricans, three times as many as 15 years ago, making this “the fastest growing segment of the city's population.” Despite “some recent inlprovements,” the group said, the Puerto Rican still face special problems here. “The destruction of his cultural patterns before he has had time or opportunity to replace them with new ones,” the group's report said, “contributes to a state of frustration, despair and powerlessness.” “Puerto Rican efforts to break out of the poverty trap,” the report went on, are compliea,ted by, among other things, the group's “racially mixed” character. “In New York,” the report said, “this is considered a liability rather than as the asset it represents on the island.” The seven neighborhoods under study for special attention and their, population figures were as follows:   Puerto Rican Puerto Rican Neighborhood Population Per Cent Estim District 1960 1960 1962 South Bronx 284,294 44.2 132 East Harlem 207,374 35.0 71 Williamsburg 181,887 28.8 52 Browns llle 133,232 23.2 37 South Brooklyn Red look 122,247 20.9 25,583 Hamilton Grange Washington Hts. 130,381 18.8 91,583 Manhattan Park West 220,947 12.1 17,350 Totals 612,574 58.5 359 924 The report pointed out thatPuerto Ricans, unlike earlier groups of Immigrants and Negroes, did not make up a majority in any major area. “This more dispersed pattern, though desirable for many reasons, militates against purely Puerto Rican projects,” the report said. To raise family incomes, the group's proposal included training programs for both adults and youths and technical assistance to Puerto Rican businessmen. In education, the group proposed pre‐school nurseries and after‐school centers, To strengtnen family life, it proposed orientation programs for newcomers, a compadrazgo —godfather‐type—program for neglected children and services for troubled families and youth. To help organizations, the report proposed technical and financial aid for groups engaged in legal aid, housing clinics, leadership training, remedial reading, social service, civil rights and cultural activities. Among those who helped to draw up the program were Antonia Pantoja, Josephine Nieves, Mrs. Frances Ayala, Rev. Wal-ter Janer, Higinio Reyes, Julio Hernandez, Rev. Pablo Cotto, Manuel Cabranes, Eugene Calderon, Herman Badillo, Blanca Cedeno, Rita Ortiz, Pedro Otero, Louis Hernández, José R.

881-> Two Greeks Jailed Here For Citizenship Fraud
A Greek citizen was sentenced yesterday by Chief Federal Judge Sylvester J. Ryan to one year in prison for arranging the marriage of a Greek seaman to an American citizen to obtain permanent residence here for the seaman. The sailor received a threemonth sentence. The two, convicted after a trial, were Stravros Pantelopoulos, 37 years old, of 570 West 189th Street, who arranged the marriage, and George Panagiotidis, 30, of 1818 Anthony Avenue, the Bronx, the seaman. The former is a permanent alien resident here. The seaman entered into a sham marriage in 1959 with an American woman introduced by Pantelopoulos. The seaman paid the woman $2,000 and the arranger received $200 from her, Hugh Humphreys, assistant United States Attorney, said. Mr. Humphreys said the couple never lived together as man and wife and were divorced in 1961. A year later the seaman married a woman whom he had known in Greece.

882-> POPE HINTS AT END OF COUNCIL IN '64; In New Year's Talk He Also Notes Importance of Trip
ROME, Jan. 1—Pope Paul VI said today that his pilgrimage to the Holy Land and the conclusion of the Ecumenical Council were two events in 1964 “that may affect the fate of many souls.” In a New Year's speech, the Pontiff described his three‐day pilgrimage, which starts Saturday, as a return to the fountainhead of Christianity. His reference to the Ecumenical Council was the strongest hint by the Pope so far that he hoped it would end this year. Pope Paul was addressing a crowd of several thousand that gathered in St. Peter's Square at noon to receive the blessing the Pope customarily imparts from a window of the Apostolic Palace on Sundays and feast days. Before giving his benediction, the Pontiff delivered a short address and prayed the Angelus, a devotion recalling the birth of Jesus, with the throng. Speaking in Italian, Pope Paul observed in his speech that the New Year “seems to inspire serene wishes of peace and wellbeing for all.” The Vatican Council, he said, was to be “conducted to a good end” during the year. Although seemingly made in passing, the remark at once caused many comments among churchmen here. Many ecclesiastics declared that they were at a loss to see how the Council could complete its heavy agenda of unresolved issues this year unless the Pope made full use of his powers and intervened authoritatively to cut further debates and enforce new church legislation. More than 2,000 Roman Catholic bishops and other prelates from all over the world assembled in St. Peter's Basilica in October, 1961, for the first plenary session of Vatican Council II, which lasted until December of that year. The second plenary session opened last Sept. 29 and closed Dec. 4. A third plenary session is scheduled for next September. It is understood that it will end early in November to allow Council participants—and possibly also the Pope—to attend the International Eucharistic Congress in Bombay, India, later that month. So far the Council has produced lively debate, but little in the way of new church enactments. So far the only enactments have been a constitution on liturgy and a decree on communications munications media, both proclaimed in a public meeting Dec 4. Fifteen weighty schemata, or draft decrees, remain on the Council agenda.

883-> NAVY WILL ATTEMPT PHOTOS OF THRESHER
Official sources have disclosed that the Navy hopes to photograph the hull of the submarine Thresher when reconnaissance in the wreck area is resumed this year. The successful search last year resulted in discovery of an abundance of torn wire, twisted pipes and sections of steel plating. One of the pipes, salvaged from a depth of 8,450 feet, bore a Thresher identification mark, “593 boat.” Capt. Frank A. Andrews, who headed the Navy's Thresher Search Group that found the wreckage, has said he is con‐ vinced that the pressure hull of the Thresher is not morej than 100 yards from the rest of the wreckage. Further work in the wreck area had to be called off last September by the arrival of autumn with its frequent stormy weather. The nuclear‐powered Thresh- er broke up during a test dive April 10, 1963, 254 miles eastnortheast of Boston with 129 crewmen and civilian technicians aboard

884-> INDIVIDUAL TAXES CUT BY $9 BILLION; But Dividend Provision Will Limit Savings of a Few
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 —Two years from now, the 51 million individuals and couples who share their income with the Federal Government will be keeping about $9 billion more of it than they do under present law. That represents the presently estimated over‐all effect of the Administrations tax bill when its top‐to‐bottom rate reductions are fully in force. It works out as an average tax cut of about 19 per cent. The new rates are tailored to give persons at the bottom of the income scale the greatest share of relief while substantially easing the burden of those in middle and high‐income brackets. About 1.5 million twobracket taxpayers will get a 100 per cent cut as a result of higher standard deductions for contributions, interest and other such outlays. Taking into account the combined effect of rate cuts and structural provisions, the average cut on income up to $3,000. is 30 per cent. It is 13.2 per cent on income above $50,000. Average cuts at other income levels are: $3,000 to $5,000, 26.9 per cent; $5,000 to $10 000, 20.6 per cent; $10,000 to $20,000, 17 per cent, and $20,‐ The over‐all average reduction in rates alone is about 20 per cent. But this and other averages are misleading to any taxpayer who wants to know how the bill affects him personally. For example, if he has income from corporation dividends he may find that his tax cut is below the average. This is because the bill repeals a 1954 provision that permits stockholders to subtract an amount equal to 4 per cent of their dividends from the tax they would otherwise pay. In many instances, however, the loss will be offset by another provision that increases the present tax‐free allownace on dividends. This allowance. or exclusion, is now $50 for single taxpayers and $100 for married couples. The bill raises it to $100 and $200 respectively. The combined effect of the two provisions, according to treasury calculations, will be a tax cut on the dividend income of a million investors with “moderate” stockholdings. Altogether, 6.2 million taxpayers receive dividend income. The Treasury Department has made an intensive study of the combined effect of the tax rate reductions, the effects of the two‐stage repeal of the 4 per cent dividend credit and the doubling of the dividend exclusion. It found, in almost every case, that the rate reductions and increased dividend exclusion more than offset the loss of the credit. To owe a bigger tax bill on the same amount of income, after repeal of the dividend credit, a taxpayer would have to fit the following circumstances precisely: If he were a married man, and he and his wife both had dividend income, so that they could take full advantage of the new $200 dividend exclusion for a married couple, their entire taxable income would have to be from dividends and it would have to be between $7,901 and $8,049. Their additional tax would range from 1 cent to $1.00. There is a slightly larger chance for a married couple to owe additional tax under the new law if all or most of their dividend income is received by one spouse and they, therefore, cannot take advantage of the full $200 dividend exclusion. If all their taxable income were from dividends and that ranged from $6,951 to $12,750, they might owe additional taxes of as much as $10.50. They could avoid this by changing the names in which some of this dividend‐producing stock is held. It is not mathematically possible, the Treasury found, for a single person to pay more than 50 cents more tax than at present on the same amount of income as a result of the changes in the taxation of dividends, when these are coupled with the tax rate reductions approved by Congress. Dividend recipients who will get a larger tax cut than their fellow taxpayers who have no dividend income at all range across the income spectrum. The higher the total income of these taxpayers, the larger the amounts of dividend income they can receive and still benefit more from the doubling of the dividend exclusion than they suffer from the loss of the dividend credit. At $4,000 to $6,000 of taxable income, a married couple can have dividends of $575 and still wind up ahead, even without taking the tax rate reductions into account. At $8,000 to $12,000, the figure is $650; at $16,000 to $20,000, it is $800; at $32.000 to $36,000, $1,150; at $44,000 to $52,000, $1,350; and in the $200,000‐and‐up bracket, it is $1,850. Most of the bill's other structural provisions have a much narrower impact than repeal of the dividend credit. Even so, any given taxpayer may find that he is affected by one or more of them. Some involve tax increases and others involve reductions. Typically, a provision that permits persons with widely fluctuating earnings to average their income over five years for tax purposes promises about $40 million in annual savings to actors, professional athletes and others. By contract, another provision, which limits tax‐free allowances on sick pay, is expected to deprive workers of about $65 million in savings available under the present law. Other revenue‐raising provisions deal with a wide variety of things such as stock options, life insurance, oil and gas depletion allowances, personal holding companies and deductions for payment of state and local tobacco and liquor taxes. The list of provisions designed to benefit taxpayers is equally long. Among the many areas covered are deductions for child care expenses, charitable contributions, medicines for persons over 65 and travel expenses of business men.

885-> ARTHUR A. SCHMON OF ONTARIO PAPER; Newsprint Executive Dies—Chicago Tribune Director
CHICAGO, March 18—Arthur A. Schmon, board chairmand chief executive officer of the Ontario Paper Company, Ltd., of Thorold, died here today in the Drake Hotel. He was also a director of the Tribune Company. Mr. Schmon, who was 68 years old, lived in St. Catherines, Ont. He was visiting here en route to his home from a vacation at Cat Cay in the Bahamas. The career of Mr. Schmon paralleled the rise of The Chicago Tribune's Canadian newsprint operation. He served under the late Col. Robert R. McCormick, editor and publisher of The Chicago Tribune, during World War I. His initiative attracted the colonel's attention and he was promoted to regimental adjutant. At the end of the war, Colonel McCormick took Mr. Schmon into the Tribune family as manager of timber operations for the paper's Ontario Paper Company at Shelter Bay. His rise in business was rapid. By 1933 he was elected president of the Ontario Paper Company and three years later he was supervising the construction of a newsprint mill at Baie Comeau, Que., a power development nearby and the town itself. Mr. Schmon became president and general manager of the Quebec North Shore Paper Company when it was incorporated in 1938 to operate the Tribune's newsprint activities in Quebec. He also became chief executive officer and board chairman of that company and of the Quebec and Ontario Transportation Company, Ltd. He also was a director or officer of many related companies. Mr. Schmon was appointed a trustee of the McCormickPatterson Trust in the will of Colonel McCormick. The trust has controlling interest In the Tribune Company, which publishes 5 newspapers and operates 15 subsidiaries and affiliates. Mr. Schmon was also made I a trustee of the Robert R. McCormick Charitable Trust, to which the colonel left the bulk of his estate. He was born in Newark, N. J., on May 10, 1895, and received a B.A. degree from Princeton University in 1917. Mr. Schmon was founder and past president of the Princeton Alumni Association of Canada and a member of the university's executive committee. His first wife died in April, 1983. On Feb. 17 of this year Mr. Schmon married Mrs. Chesser M. Campbell, widow of the publisher of The Tribune and president of the Tribune Company. A son, Robert McCormick Schmon, president of the Ontario Paper and Quebec North Shore Paper Companies, and two grandsons also survive.

MIAMI BEACH, Feb. 25 (AP)—Among the interested listeners at Jack Nilon's dressing‐room conference tonight were Rocky Marciano, the former heavyweight champion, and Cus DAmato, the former manager of Floyd Patterson, twice a one‐round knockout victim of Liston. “Clay sure surprised me,” said Marciano. “I didn't realize he was that good a fighter. He was quick and deceptive. He fought a smart fight.” D'Amato kept shaking his head in an “I‐told‐you‐so” manner. “That's the way Patterson should have fought. Hit and run . hit and run. This kid did just that. He put up a perfect fight. He kept sticking and movout of the way. “That's the way to beat Liston. If Patterson had fought that way, he would still be the champion of the world.' One of Liston's trainers gave a slightly different version of how and when Liston sustained his shoulder injury. “Liston threw a hook in the fifth round,” said Joe Polino. “Clay stopped it in midair and Liston felt something crack in his left shoulder.” Polino, who stayed behind when Liston was whisked to a hospital, said Sonny was crying as he left the dressing room. “He was disgusted,” the trainer added. “He was broken up. He was crying.”

889-> SOUTH IS WARNED ON NEGRO POVERTY; Georgian Bids Colleagues in House Drop ‘Old Ways’
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28—A Georgia Representative warned today that the South would remain poor as long as the Negro continued “at the bottom of the heap.” Appealing to Southern colleagues to discard what he called the “old ways” of the past, the Georgian, Charles Longstreet Weltner, told the House: “Where before we sought to exclude him, we must now seek ways of bringing the Negro into a better life. Where before, we have been content with personal charity and individual kindness to the Negro, we must now recognize the dramatic need for bettering the lot of all the poor—white and Negro.” Mr. Weltner, 36‐year‐old Democrat, serving his second year in the House, spoke even as his home city of Atlanta was embroiled in bitter racial turmoil. Representative Weltner said that almost half the families in the South were poor, with annual incomes of less than $3,000. Besides the gap between the South and the rest of the nation, he noted, “there is also a gap, within the South, between the material well‐being of white and Negro Southerners.” The median income of the Negro in Georgia, he said, is $927 a year while that of the white Georgian is $2,470. He suggested that, instead of continuing to “point accusatory fingers, make excuses and find scapegoats” to explain its poverty, the South should seek to do something about it. Further ammunition for President Johnson's “war on poverty” came today in two labor surveys issued by the White House. One report showed that the well‐being of 6.3 million Americans was affected by unemployment of the family bread winners. The other report showed that unemployment had been steadily rising in the Appalachian coal fields because of competitive and technological changes. Commenting on the survey dealing with the unemployment of family heads, President Johnson said: “The cycle of poverty begins here. If we are to wage a successful war against poverty in the United States, then we must begin by helping all workers with family responsibilities to find a productive place in American economy.” The survey reported that in 1962 about 11.5 million children under the age of 18 were being raised in families with annual incomes of under $3,000—less than $60 a week. To meet the problem, the Department of Labor proposed the expansion of training and retraining programs. President Johnson is expected to call for this in his special poverty message to Congress early next month. In releasing the report on unemployment in the coal industry, a White House spokesman said: “The depression in coal unemployment is at the core of the complex of economic and social problems in the Appalachian region.” Appalachia, stretching from eastern Pennsylvania to Alabama, is considered the worst pocket of unemployment in the country. The Appalachian Regional Commission, appointed last year by President Kennedy, is expected to submit a report to President Johnson Feb. 15. The commission will ask for a$4.25 billion five‐year program to restore economic health to the region.

891-> Chou Says Peking and Moscow Will Stand Together in a Crisis
Premier Chou En‐lai of Communist China has declared that what he described as “a dispute” between brothers would never find China and the Soviet Union apart in a time of world crisis. Mr. Chou's opinions were aired last night over Channel 13 in a broadcast of National Educational Television. The program, taped in Peking before the Premier left on his African trip, was an interview given by Mr. Chou to Felix Greene, a British writer and lecturer. In a second, separate, part of the one‐hour broadcast, Roger Hilsman Jr., Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern' Affairs, discussed the Premier's views with Saville Davis of The Christian Science Monitor. Differences Conceded “There are differences in principle between us and the Soviet leadership on a number of major problems of MarxismLeninism,” Mr. Chou conceded in reply to a question. Speaking in Chinese, he continued: “They constitute a dispute inside the international Communist movement. In the end, these differences will surely be resolved and the movement is bound to become stronger and firmer as a result.” He condemed as despicable efforts by “reactionaries” to drive a wedge between Peking I and Moscow. But as I see it, “they had better not rejoice too soon.” he added. Mr. Chou asserted that the fundamental interests of China and the Soviet Union were the same, “an objective fact and no one can deny it. He added: “Whatever happens, the fraternal Chinese and Soviet peoples will stand together in any storm that breaks out in the world arena.” Later Mr. Hilsman objected that American policy had not changed with respect to the Soviet Union and China. “It is the behavior of the two that is different,” he explained and added: “What is different, recently, is that the Chinese Communists have remained in this had Stalinist cold war posture whereas the Soviet Union has behaved more responsibly.” Much of what Mr. Chou said prior to his African trip was repeated in Cairo, Algiers, Tunis and Accra. He stressed the peaceful intentions of his country and the belief that Peking was not isolated. Indeed, the Premier contended that, as things are now developing, Communist China has a growing number of friends and those who “are really isolated are the imperialists and reactionaries.” Mr. Hilsman defined Unitecl States policy in the face of China's challenge as one of “firmness, flexibility and dispassion.” Most important of all, Mr. Hilsman said, was “dispassion,” by which he meant that the complicated problems posed by China today must be approached “coolly, unemotionally, objectively, with the best interests of the United States and of all of our allies, and of humanity as a whole. in our minds.” Trial by strength was mentioned by both the Premier and Mr. Hilsman. Mr. Chou said that "we believe that only by demonstrating the will to fight to the end can people deter imperialism from redl:iess adventures.” Mr. Hilsman observed: “I think the Chinese Communists would be hesitant to do anything that didn't take into account the strength of the free world.”

893-> EARNINGS RAISED AT JIM WALTER; Builder Nets 88c a Share in Half, Up From 50c
Consolidated net income of the Jim Walter,Corporation, Tampa, Fla., builder of small homes, for the six months ended Feb. 29 rose to $1,718,997 from $972,132 in the similar period last year, the concern reported yesterday. The earnings were equal to 88 sents a share on 1,949,721 common shares outstanding and compared with 50 cents a share in the period a year before. Revenues increased to $74,629,910 from $61,984,599. Figures for 1963 have been restated to include sales and the company's equity in earnings of the Celotex Corporation, which was consolidated with Jim Walter at the end of the 1963 fiscal year. Celotex Corporation's results were sharply higher. For the six months to last Feb. 29, net earnings climbed to $971,767, or 83 cents a share of common stock from $164,901, or 4 cents a share, in the year‐earlier period, based on 1,018,651 common shares outstanding. Revenues totaled $54,481,806, compared with $43,334,524. Figures for 1963 were restated by the company to include South Coast Corporation, consolidated with Celotex at the end of fiscal 1963 Sales and earnings of the ABC Vending Corporation last year were the highest in its history. A report yesterday put net income of the vending machine operator at $2,819,971, or $1.03 a share, last year, up from $2,694,203, or 98 cents a share, in 1962. Net sales totaled $102,637,909 and $97,027,956, respectively. The Santa Fe Drilling Company last year earned a record $2,466,504, or $1.64 a share, the contract drilling company reported yesterday. This compares with $2,195,909, or $1.46 a share, in 1962. Revenues advanced to $26,194,405 from $24,276,291 in 1962. Sales of J. J. Newberry Company, variety and department store chain, rose in 1963 to $319.3 million from $312.5 million in 1962. However, the company had a loss of $2,556,050 last year from operations, against a profit of $1,984,203 in 1962. The company also made a nonrecurring charge of $2.22 million in 1963 against retained earnings. The loss and the nonrecurring charge, according to the annual report issued yesterday, were due chiefly to adjustments in inventories. Walter C. Straus, named president of New berry last April in a management shake‐up, called 1963 “a year of correcting many unsatisfactory conditions” with a consequent effect on earnings. The rise in sales last year was ascribed to the opening of new stores. Those stores that were open throughout 1962 and 1963 showed an 8 per cent decrease in sales in 1963. Discussing the future, Mr. Straus commented: “With our inventory situation corrected, many expense savings programs now in effect, improved merchandise assortments in the stores ... we believe that Newberry will be back on the road to reasonably good earnings in 1964.” Despite lower sales, net income of M. Lowenstein & Sons, Inc., big textile producer, Inc., last year advanced to $2,215,242, or 78 cents a share, from $2,306,725, or 81 cents a share, in 1962, it reported yesterday. Net sales declined to $265,521,987 from $270,602,037 in 1962. Net income of Foremost Daires, Inc., for the first quarter will rise about 10 per cent from the $1,218,000, or 15 cents a share, recorded in the 1963 period, R. J. Drews, president, predicted yesterday. Net sales in the first quarter are expected to be down slightly from the $102,684,000 a year ago. The drop in sales, he said, will result from the divestiture of northeastern regional properties after the first quarter last year under a Federal Trade Commission order. The F.T.C. in 1962 ordered Foremost to divest itself of 10 milk and ice cream concerns acquired between 1952 and 1955. The company is in the process of deciding on a method of divestiture for its southeastern region properties under the F.T.C. order. The company is studying a proposal under which a new subsidiary might be organized with the shares offered on an exchange basis to existing Foremost shareholders. Foremost plans to use tne money from its divestitures for acquiring companies in diversified food product lines. Under the F.T.C. order the company cannot acquire dairy product companies. It already has about $14 million; “pretty much intact,” from the sale of its former northeastern region properties, Mr. Drews said.

900-> Roving TV ‘Radar’ Checks on Audience
CHICAGO, April 5—Television viewers may soon be unable to keep their program choices a secret. A device exhibited here today can count how many TV sets in a household are turned on and determine to which channels they are tuned. The viewersin the house would not even know that the tabulation had been made. A truck containing a device much like radar would roam the streets and pick up tiny signals radiated by all TV sets. The signals indicate the number of the channel to which a receiver is tuned. The device is part of the engineering exhibit at the annual convention of the National Association of Broadcasters, which formally opens tomorrow. Donald H. McGannon, president of the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company and chairman of the N.B.A. research committee, said the device might augur a “total revolution” in the business of compiling estimated audience sizes, better known as ratings. Mr. McGannon said that the idea inherent in the electronic counting of television households had been tried 10 times in the last 10 years without success but that the new device apparently used a substantially different technical approach. The inventor of the device is James L. Tanner, who with his brother, Thomas, operates the Tanner Engineering Company of Wilmington, Calif. At the N.A.B. engineering exhibition, at which the giants of electronics pre‐empt the choice space, the two Tanners were in the most remote corner. They did not, however, lack for company. The Tanner machine is eerie in appearance and it prompted a number of “Big Brother” jokes to which the two men had to listen. The key to undetectable electronic eavesdropping on television households lies in a technical fact little known to the average set owner: As part of the process of receiving a picture a set also acts as a tiny transmitter. When a person has his set turned on, he is radiating a signal that could come only from the particular channel to which his set is tuned. The function of the Tanner machine is to collect these tiny signals, sort them out and then total the number tuned to each channel in an area under survey. To collect the signals, which are technically known as horizontal oscillators, the Tanners use a truck on the front of which is mounted a rotating screen roughly similar to the radar screen used by ships and airplanes. As the truck proceeds at a minimum speed of five miles an hour, it can reach out electronically about three blocks on either side. Only a fraction of a second is required to register the incoming signal from a set. The signal is then compared with those on small portable receivers in the truck, one for each channel, to determine the originating channel. James Tanner said that he could count the signals coming from more than 100 sets every minute. At this rate, he could get 3,000 samplings in a half‐hour, the most common running time for TV programs. A broadcast attorney said he doubted if any rights of privacy would be violated. “At the very least it would require a new interpretation of the law as it now stands,” he said. “I can't think of anything that bears on such a question.” In communications law, the lawyer went on, most Federal provisions are directed toward protection of the secrecy of private conversations or messages between two parties. All existing rating systems require the consent and knowledge of any set owner participating in a survey. They involve attachment of a recording device directly to a set or learning viewer choices either by telephone inquiry or through diaries in which viewers record what they have watched. With a smile, he acknowledged that probably something along the lines of instant voting was now scientifically feasible, enough trucks, money and interest. It television viewers were to answer “yes” to a question by leaving their sets tuned all night to channel X and “no” by leaving them tuned to Channel Y, by morning there could be a fairly precise measurement of public opinion, he said. The question whether the use of the Tanner device might involve a legal problem of invasion of privacy appeared moot tonight. In an isolated rural area an intercepted signal could be traced to a particular house and the residents' choice of program could be determined. In a heavily populated area the task of pinpointing the signal's source would be more difficult, if not impossible Mr. McGannon and other TV researchers cautioned that the Tanners might face an uphill fight in winning acceptance for their machine. Obtaining a representative cross‐section of the population might be difficult because touring all kinds of neighborhoods within the same half hour could prove expensive. However, several persons with good connections in official Washington suggested that the Tanners could not have picked a better time to display their equipment. What the public watches on TV, at least as reflected in the rating figures uniformly accepted by the TV industry, is determined now by recording devices attached to only 1,200 TV sets across the country If 30 trucks could be carefully distributed in the 30 cities with the largest populations, these sources went on, the public might be more favorably impressed by a resultant sampling of 90,000 homes. Mr. McGannon stressed that the interest of the N.A.B. research committee in the Tanner device was whether it would provide one more tool and criterion for more accurate audience measurements. A West Coast engineer who had ridden in the truck said the results were “impressive,” according to Mr. McGannon. So far the truck has not been taken on the road in Chicago. En route from California it developed a defective axle.

901-> Army's ‘Laser Rifle’ Shoots Bursts of Light
BOSTON, March 3 (UPI) —A “laser rifle” has been delivered to the Army's Frankford Arsenal in Philadelphia by a Boston concern. A spokesman for Maser Optics, Inc., said today the device, which produces intense bursts of light, could be used to ignite objects, detonate explosives or to blind persons temporarily. It also could be used as navigational instrument or as a ranging device in surveying, he said. The device is shaped like a rifle and has a line‐of‐sight range similar to that of radar. The operator releases a burst of light by pressing a trigger. “Laser” is an acrostic for “light amplification by stimulated electromagnetic radiation.”

UNITED NATIONS, N. Y.. Feb. 12—India stayed away from a British reception last night, apparently irritated by the British statement on Kashmir in the Security Council Monday. Sir Patrick Dean, the British delegate, supported Pakistan's argument that the Kashmiris should decide their own political status by plebiscite—a position opposed by India. Sir Patrick was host last night at a party attended by R. A. Butler, the British Foreign Secretary, and most of the delegation leaders from the: British Commonwealth countries. A spokesman for the Indian delegation gave the usual dip‐ lomatic excuse of a “previous engagement” in explaining the absence of the delegation members.

903-> Polaris Submarines Getting Spanish Base
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22—The United States will reinforce its missile fleet with a new Polaris submarine facility at Rota, Spain, early next week. Navy officials suddenly confirmed today the long‐rumored agreement with Spain for the assignment of a new Polaris submarine squadron to the Rota base on the Bay of Cadiz. In fact, a Pentagon source said Spain gave its approval for the base “several months ago,” long before the United States indicated concern over a Spanish sale of fishing boats to Cuba. The sale has placed in question the United States program of aid to Spain, in accordance with a policy of isolating Cuba. Technically the new installation will not be a base. The Navy described it as a “replenishment facility.” It will consist chiefly of a Polaris submarine tender and a floating drydock.

904-> Public Writing Many Letters to Mrs. Johnson; She Is Asked to lntercede With Her Husband on Legislation —Daughters' Mail Heavy
WASHINGTON, Feb: 29 —Judging from the White House mail, people believe that Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson has the Presidents ear. There are more “tell‐it‐to‐the‐President” letters to the First Lady than there have been in Administrations back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the number is growing. This is probably because, unlike Jacqueline Kennedy, Mamie Eisenhower and Bess Truman, Lady Bird Johnson has been and continues to be deeply involved in her husband's political life. Letters to the Johnsons faithfully reflect the change in the occupants of the White House. With three teen‐agers now in residence, mail from their age group is on the upswing. Lynda Bird, Lucy Baines (who now is spelling it “Luci”) and the star boarder, Warrie Lynn, get 100 letters all told each week. What the White House staff describes as “old brocade” notes dealign with the furnishings and renovation of the Executive Mansion, so important during Mrs. Kennedy's tenure, are on the decline. Hortense Burton, head of the family's correspondence section, says there has been a “subtle change” letters to the First Lady that is growing more obvious every day. “Mrs. Johnson is so interested in anything having to do with legislation that people are writing in encouraging her to prod the President a little bit on different legislative matters, or telling her to commend him on various stands, such as the war on poverty,” Miss Burton said. “This kind of mail is growing all the time.” The staff also refers to this kind of mail as “eyes‐and‐ears” mail, in which the people use the First Lady as an intermediary between them and the President. “They believe the President is too important and too busy to approach directly,” one employe explained. For the first time in recent Administrations, the President's wife has asked for a weekly substance report from her correspondence section on types of mail, with samples, coming in to the First Family. She has also met with those who handle mail for her on how letters should be answered. Some she likes to see and reply to herself. “I don't want to be devoured by my mail, but neither do I want to be insulated against it,” she told her staff. “While it is pleasant to see those that praise me and my family, it is also necessary to see those with some complaints,” Mrs. Johnson said. “I know these letters are not just quarrelsome but the criticism may be constructive and help me to learn to do better.” Mrs. Johnson receives between 1,500 and 2,000 letters a week. She has asked her staff to give all except obvious crank mail “a careful, thoughtful answer.” About 30 per cent of the mail consists of invitations to speak before various groups, or to send messages of sponsorship. Forty per cent involves requests for autographed pictures and information about the family—what it is like to live in the White House, what kinds of pets thcy have, what they do in their spare time and biogra phies of the daughters. Into this group also fall queries about White House furnishings. At the beginning of the Johnson Administration, the “tell‐it‐to‐the‐President” mail totaled about 10 per cent. It has spiraled upward ever since, as the public came to know more about the interests of Mr. Johnson. About two‐thirds of the “tell‐it‐to‐the‐President” letters are from women of every economic level—miners' wives, teachers, matrons of the leisure class. Some are typed, others are written on fancy stationery or Laboriously penciled on lined school paper. A woman of sentiment with a prodigious memory, Mrs. Johnson also calls nostalgic letters from old friends “a delight to receive.” One that came in this week was from Grace N. Cowles, who had been a teacher of Mrs. Johnson's in the Fern Elementary School near Karnack. Tex. “Dear Lady Bird,” the letter began, “I have thought of you so often during the years since I knew you at the age of 9” Mrs. Cowles said that in those days “I was never called anything but ‘Teacher,’ so I just wonder if you even remember me.” She said she still kept a picture of the 9‐year‐old Lady Bird with the five “Jones children” taken in front of her school. After 40 years, she said, she could only remember three of their names. Mrs. Johnson replied: “Of course I remember you—and so much about those days—walking up the long red clay hillside to school, rolling in the piles of stacked‐up leaves in the fall.” “You mentioned the Jones family,” the First Lady went on, “The other two are Joe and Paul. I still hear from Maydell, who now lives in California.”

905-> Police Get Identity Cards To Help Expose Fakers
If a stranger should approach you and flash a city detective's badge, ask him to prove he's a real detective. If he whips out a light green identification card that bears his photograph, physical description, thumbprint, signature, shield number and tax registry (payroll) number—as well as the official shields of the City of New York and Police Department, and the Police Commissioner's signature—do as he says. He's real. The Police Department has just issued 25.900 such cards to members of the force. Deputy Police Commissioner Walter Arm said yesterday that their primary function was to give the public additional means of establishing the identity of detectives and policemen in plain clothes. If anyone claiming to be a detective does not produce the new identification card on request, Commissioner Arm's advice is to call the police—the “detective” is probably a fake. The cards had been under since last sum– mer. Yesterday Commissioner Arm said that the final decision had been influenced by the rising number of crimes committed by holdup men, confidence men and other criminals posing as detectives or plainclothesnmen. Mr. Arm said that although all members of the force had received the cards, only detectives and policemen and policewomen in plain clothes were required to produce them on request. The department stilI considers its distinctive uniform together with the official metal shield sufficient identification for uniformed patrolmen. According to regulations that went out with the new cards. a detective who has reason to identify himself will first show his shield and will not produce the new card unless asked. Commissioner Arm emphasized that the card was valid only when presented with an official shield. He also admonished the public to examine the card carefully in case of any doubt. Patrolmen's and sergeants' cards bear the same number that appears on their metal shields, but for ranks above sergeant the card has no number. since shields of the higher ranks are not numbered.

912-> Food: Tangy Marmalade; Supply Good of Bitter Seville Orange That Is Vital to the Flavor of Preserve
THE Seville orange is back in town, with only a week or two left of its one‐month stand. Consequently, now is the time for all good preservers to condition that strong right arm for the tedious slicing of fruit and strenuous wielding of that heavy old preserving pan. Although the orange is generally known as a Seville, due to its sunny Spanish origins, it is frequently called a bitter orange. This makes sense, not only because the orange is, indeed, bitter, but also because the small supplies that reach New York hail from sunny Florida, not Spain. “One of the orange growers in the Indian River section has set aside one part of his orchard for this type of orange,” explained Teresa Pedi of Calarco Gaetano, a company specializing in wholesaling fancy fruits. “He saved it specially for my father, and we still receive his crop about February of each year.” Last year, along with the rest of the Florida citrus crop, the bitter oranges fell victim to the weather's foul play. This year, however, the crop is of good size or, in Teresa's words, “a nice one.” “The oranges are almost pretty this year,” she added, “which is unusual. Normally they look terrible.” Fortunately, lack of photogenic qualities matters not, since the destiny of these oranges is to be sliced into the preserving pot. Their cost is $2 or more a dozen, according to size. Seville oranges are currently available at Martin's Fruit Shop, 1264. Third Avenue, and the Charles & Co. stores at 340 and 684 Madison Avenue. “We've been shipping these oranges all over the country,” a spokesman for Martin's commented. “One woman even sent us a telegram from Missouri, saying she's heard Sevilles were in and asking us to ship her three dozen.” People were also coming into the store from “all over —Westchester, Long Island, etc.,” he added. “They're not young folks mostly. The young people don't know what marmalade is.” Anyone who does know what marmalade is also knows that the bitter Seville oranges are indispensable for a really good, tangy product. BITTER ORANGE MARMALADE 2  1 9 8 1. Slice the oranges and lemon very thinly and place, with the juice that runs out during slicing, in a large bowl. Remove the seeds, tie in a muslin bag and add to the bowl. Add the cold water, cover and let stand 24 to 48 hours. 2. Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer gently until the peel is soft, one hour or more. Remove the muslin bag, squeezing gently. Add the sugar, stir until it dissolves, raise the heat and boil rapidly until the mixture gives a jelly test—two drops form on the edge of a metal spoon and drop off simultaneously. For a stiffer marmalade, continue boiling until the drops run together as they fall off. 3. When the marmalade has reached the desired consistency, skim the foam from the surface and pour immediately into sterilized jars. Seal. Yield: About four pints.

913-> RULING EXPECTED ON FREEDOM BANK; Court to Decide on Suit to Block First Meeting
Federal Judge Edmund L. Palmieri is expected to rule today on whether the Freedom National Bank may hold its first stockholders’ meeting tomorrow. A number of would‐be stockholders, led by Dunbar S. McLaurin, have brought suit to block the meeting and to expel from control of the $1.5 million bank the present leadership, headed by Jackie Robinson. The bank, conceived and initially organized by Mr. McLaurin, is scheduled to open sometime in June at 275 West 125th Street, near Eighth Avenue, in Harlem. Mr. McLaurin had a falling out with the other organizers. They expelled him from the organization committee. He is striving to win back control of the bank and to become president. Before Judge Palmieri in Federal Courthouse in Foley Square yesterday,he questioned the legality of his expulsion. Mr. McLaurin added a postscript to more than an hour of oral argument by lawyers for both sides that began at 5:13 P.M. At issue was whether the stockholder meeting, scheduled ‘or 9:30 A.M. tomorrow, should be allowed to go on. Marion O. Jones, representing the plaintiffs, whom he described as spokesmen for a stockholders’ protective committee, said the holding of the meeting would lead to election of the Robinson group as directors. That would give them control of the $1.5 million bank, he said, and irreparably harm 200 to 300 persons who have sought in vain to buy stock in the bank. Mr. Jones, with some prompting from the judge, contended that the frustrated subscribers to the stock had a contractual right to buy the stock because they had accepted a public offer made by the organizers. Samual R. Pierce Jr.. one of the organizers and the banks lawyer, replied that no tender for stock‐had been refused before March 15, when, he said, all 60,000 shares — offered at $25 each — were sold out. Mr. Pierce said that no irreparable harm to tle plaintiffs could flow ‘from the meeting because the election of directors could be invalidated” if a hearing on the merits of the suit showed the meeting should not have been held. Mr. Pierce said another purpose of the stockholder meeting was to secure the shareholders approval of certairxontemplated expenditures s Mr. Pierce said. the organizers had authority from the Controller tospend the money but wanted stockholder sanctionfor“psychological’ reasons. But he said, failure to hold the meeting as scheduled would cause new uncertainty ‘about the ‘bank. Stockholders will start asking fOr their money back. This bank will not be able to recover,” Mr. Pierceaid. Mr. Pierce is a member of the New York State Banking Board and a former judge of General Sessions. The eight plaintiffshave charged that the ’ bank falsely asserted in an offering brochure that Harlem businessmen and residents would get priority in allocation of the stock. Mr. Pierce said that Mr. McLaurin was told by the ‘Controller of the Currency, James J. Saxon, last Dec. 10, that he could not be president of the bank. The Controller, in granting preliminary approval for the bank in September, had indicated Mr. McLaurin was acceptable as president. Following the Dec. 10 “meeting, Mr. Pierce said, there was a brief period of harmony. Then Mr. McLaurin “embarked on a kind of campaign to control this bank or to destroy it.” ‐ Mr. Pierce said that he believed “Mr. McLaurin is the one behihd this lawsuit although he is nominally named as a defendant.” Mr. McLaurin, who arrived in the courtroom at 5:57P.M., was granted a brief appearance by Judge Palmieri after Mr. Pierce finished. The judge listened while on his feet Mr. McLaurin said that he had selected the other organizers of the bank on the basis of their reputation. As things turned out, he said, “certain persons were unable to resist an opportunity for personal gain.” He did not say whom he had in mind. He charged that the banks leadership intended to make “a kangaroo sessioin’ of the stockholder meeting. In support of that assertion. he cited the fact that the meeting was scheduled for 9:30 in the morning “in a working community” andthat the bank had invited stockholders who could not attend to send in proxies. The meeting is scheduled to be held in the Y.W.C.A. at 361 West ‘25th Street.

914-> Southern Pacific Quits Association
The Southern Pacific Company, the biggest railroad in the West, has withdrawn from the executive, legal and public relations activities of the Association of Western Railways, the organization of the 41 Western carriers. The resignation became effective on Dec. 31, but was announced yesterday by the association and the railroad. The latter continues as a member of the association's rate, car ‐ weighing and inspection bureaus. Both the Southern Pacifio and the A. W. R. declined to comment on the move. Executives of other railroads minimized the S. P. decision. While Clair Roddewig, association president, would not discuss it for the record, he was quoted by press agencies as saying that he did not feel it would have any substantial effect on the association. It was learned, however, that one reason for the Southern Pacific's withdrawal was that other Western railroads had questioned late last year the appointment of a labor representative of the Southern Pacific to a committee of the National Railway Labor Conference now dealing with a labor contract for shop craft employes. These are car men, repair men and mechanics. An alternate was, soon named. The Southern Pacific did not hide its annoyance. It is an open secret that there was considerable criticism within the industry of the labor policies of Donald P. Russell, S. P. president, about 26 months ago. At that time the S. P. made a labor agreement with the Order of Railroad Telegraphers under which the line agreed to a contract providing permanent work or equivalent wages during the lifetime of its then 946 regular telegraphers. That contract provided for a job ceiling of 1,000 positions and stipulated that jobs could be abolished in the future only if the necessity was proved, and then by no more than 20 jobs a year. The last prominent withdrawal from a railroad trade organization occurred in 1947, when the late Robert R. Young withdrew the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, of which he then was chairman, from the Association of American Railroads. This is the industrywide trade association. Its annual budget in recent years has been one‐half that of the Association of Western Railroads. The budget of the A. W. A. runs to $12 million a year.

916-> LEGISLATORS VOTE OWN ETHICS CODE; Permit Continued Practice Before Court of Claims—Laporte Bills Scored
ALBANY, March 23 — The Legislature gave final approval tonight to its own version of an ethics code for legislators. In doing so, it turned down the proposals of the Laporte committee, which the Republican legislative leaders appointed late last year to recommend ways of strengthening the existing code. The existing code was adopted 10 years ago and has not been changed. Tonight's action disposed of one of the top issues that remained to be resolved before adjournment, which is scheduled for Wednesday. The Laporte committee, which was headed by Cloyd Laporte, chairman of the New York City Board of Ethics, was denounced in both houses. Legislators said the committee's report had left implications of wrongdoing by lawmakers. The Senate, which acted first, had before it only the Rules Committee bill. It approved the measure, 54 to 1. In the Assembly a companion bill, and two bills incorporating the recommendations of the Laporte committee, were debated together. The Assembly approved the companion bill, 142 to 4, then recommitted the Laporte bills when a show ofhands indicated Overwhelming opposition to bills. However, 21 Assemblymen were recorded against the motion to recommit the first,of the bills and 15 against recommitting the second. While there were a number of differences between the proposed codes, the principal conflict was over a recommendation by the Laporte Committee to prohibit lawyer‐legislators from practicing before the Court of Claims and before most state agencies. The Legislature's. bill would permit such practice but would make it unlawful for legislators to accept cases on a contingent fee basis. The approved bill also sets up restrictions for accepting and tendering gifts, including entertainment, and expands the present legislative committee available to provide guidance on ethical questions. The only vote against the bill in, the Senate was cast by Frank Glinski, Democrat of Buffalo, who explained: “By voting for a code we ourselves are pleading guilty that maybe we need a code., I have the Ten Commandments and I have my integrity and as far as I am concerned tliat is enough.” He declared that the Legislature would be “losing the confidence of the public by voting for a code,” and added, “if we haive nothing to hide, why have we a code at all.” That was approximately the sentiment of the four Assemblymen, all Republicans, who opposed the bill. They were Assemblymen Joseph C. Young-love of Johnstown, Robert Hatch Jr. of Onondaga, Verner M. Ingram of St. Lawrence and Robert A. Blakeman of Nassau. In addition to barring practice before state agencies and the Court of Claims on a contingent basis, the approved code Would also do the following: ¶ Make it a misdemeanor to accept any gift, including money, service, loan, travel entertainment or hospitality having a value of $25 or more if it could reasonably be inferred that the gift was intended to influence official actions… ¶ Require the disclosure of Any stock interest in a business regulated by the state, instead of just amounts of $10,000 or more as is now required. ¶ Bar companies in which any legislator has a stock interest of 10 per Cent or more from providing goods or services of $25 or more to any state agency except on a competitive bid basis. ¶ Require legislators to list offices in any corporations and to disclose any other relationships that might reasonably be espected to be particularly affected by legislative action. The expanded advisory committee will be composed of the two standing committees, on ethics plus the dean of the Albany Law School and the president of the New York State Bar Association. Also included in the bill are a list of “general standards” to help legislators avoid compromising situations. It admonishes them not to Use their official positions to obtain ‐ special privileges, to avoid employment that could affect their independence, to avoid seeking advantage from the possession of confidential information and to pursue a course of conduct that will not arouse public suspicion that a trust might be violated. The bill, which will become effective Dec. 31 if signed by Governor. Rockefeller, . applies also to employes of the Legis-lature. John Hughes, Republican of Syracuse, spoke longest during the Senate debate and devoted much of his remarks to an attack on The New York Herald Tribune, although he did not name the paper. A series of articles in that newspaper concerning alleged conflicts of interest was among the developments that preceded the appointment of the Laporte committee. Senate Majority Leader Walter J. Mahoney did. not speak. The minority leader, Joseph Zaretzki, said that possibly some members of the Senate had made mistakes in judgment “public relations‐wise” and that the new code would be “a guide for public relations”. The assembly debate was led off by Assemblyman Donald Campbell of Amsterdam, chairman of the Assembly Ethics Committee. Urging defeat of the Laporte bills, he declared the Legislature should not be “coerced” into accepting them. Eight other Assemblymen participated in the attack, and only two, Daniel Kelly and Albert H. Blumenthal, both Democrats from Manhattan, defended the Laporte proposals. Before the Legislature passed its ethics bill, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York issued a statement contending that the bill “Would accomplish few of the special reforms recommended by the Special Committee on Ethics, under the chairmanship of Cloyd Laporte.”

JAKARTA, Indonesia, Feb. 11 (AP) — The Antara news agency said today that a Cornmunist‐led union had defied President Sukarno and seized six British‐owned plantations covering 8.5 million acres in East Java. The official agency said the Sarbupri Plantation Workers Union up a red flag last week at the plantations, which produce rubber, coffee and cocoa. Antara also said the 4,500ton British freighter Troon Breeze was seized in Eastern Borneo Jan. 19, but was released. President Sukarno ordered a ban last month on the takeover of any more British property in Indonesia, but he installed supervisory teams at British concerns in apparent preparation for a take‐over.

921-> Food News; Balance Vital in Diet of Teen-Agers
IN spite of the abundance of good food available in the United States, there are many groups of people who do not enjoy adequate or balanced diets. Research and studies have shown that teen‐agers are one of these groups and that the teen‐age girl is usually the poorest fed member of the family. During adolescence, there is an increased need for nutrients due to rapid growth, maturation and the development of new stresses and strains. The teenager's diet is frequently lacking in calcium, vitamin C and vitamin A, and low in iron. Nutritional studies in 11 Western states showed that six of every ten girls and four of every ten boys got two‐thirds or less of the nutrients recommended for their age by the National Research Council. Eaten as Snacks Sometimes a nutritionally inadequate diet is accompanied by obesity because of excess calories eaten in foods that contribute little else. Many of these high‐caloric foods are eaten as snacks between the regular three meals a day. More children of obese parents are overweight than children of normalweight parents, suggesting that family food habits are an important factor. More teen‐age girls than boys are overweight and this may be due partly to the fact that girls need about 1,000 calories a day less than their brothers and tend to engage in fewer strenuous activities. Attending the same functions and eating the same school lunches can prove to be a problem unless girls are well informed, establish sound food patterns early and have a strong incentive for curbing their appetites. Skipping breakfast because of lack of time or in the erroneous belief that it will “make you fat” has been called a prime reason for poor nutrition among teen‐agers and is one area where the home can exert a positive influence. Motivating teen‐agers to improve their nutrition is a difficult task, but it can be easier if there is an understanding of their habits, customs and needs. When food is related to teenagers' appearance, popularity, vigor and future health, it becomes an important issue and they are more likely to make a wise choice. Best Taught in Home Sound nutrition can best be taught in the home through well‐balanced family meals, especially breakfast. However, a teen‐ager's world revolves around social occasions that inevitably include food. Providing acceptable and nutritious snacks to satisfy the weightwatchers and others should be the responsibility of every teenage hostess, youth group leader and committee in charge of planning young people's activities. Fruit juices, fruit punches, milk shakes, malteds, overstuffed hero sandwiches, pizzas, hamburgers, frankfurters, chili and beans, pasta and meat sauces served with fresh salads and raw fruits and vegetables are sound choices and, happily, teen‐age favorites.

922-> Food News: Fine Cheeses of France
ALFRED SCHRATTER may have one of the largest collections of personal passports of anyone in the United States. He holds 10 of them, and he remembers when, prior to 1918, they were not even necessary for travel to Europe. He does not remember precisely how many voyages he has made to France to select fine cheese, but he is one of the foremost importers of French cheeses to this country an enterprise that he began in 1914. As in wine tasting, the selection of fine cheeses demands a discriminating palate, a certain stamina and, of course, a basic admiration for the stuff that gives milk its greatest distinction. Mr. Schratter qualifies on all counts. He is a spry gentleman who is “around 70” and he is not averse to dining on cheese three times a day. As a result of his labors, the French Government has made him a Chevalier du Merite Agricole and he has the award of the Conseil Municipal de Paris. When he is not on tour, he conducts his industry from a small office in a rambling warehouse on Greenwich Street, and the sheer bulk of his imports is prodigious. Within the course of a year he brings to New York between 350 and 400 tons of cheese in three principal categories—soft, semisoft and hard. He does not deal in grating cheese such as Parmesan or Romano since France is not distinguished for such cheeses. “Americans,” he said recently, “are becoming more and more aware of the merits of cheese. There is no doubt in my mind that New Yorkers today eat 50 per cent more cheese than they did five years ago.” Many people seem to think that there are a static number of cheeses available in any given country, but this is far from the case, the gentleman added. New Cheeses Introduced “Within the last three years,” he noted, “we have introduced nearly a dozen new cheeses.” One of the most glorious of these is Boursin, which rapidly the public fancy when it first appeared about three years ago. In its freshest state, it is an incredibly rich cheese with a soft‐running center, an ideal cheese to complement a fine red wine and a crusty loaf of bread. Of all his imports, Mr. Schratter himself is partial to his Gervais double cream. “There is nothing like it,” he said, “on God's earth.” The Gervais is what is commonly thought of as a dessert cheese. It is mild yet rich, smooth yet pleasantly tart, and is a splendid cheese to eat at breakfast with toast and jellies or jam. It is also delicious as a dessert with sweetened berries and a well‐chilled bottle of imported Sauternes wine. In addition to Boursin, Mr. Schratter imports several other cheeses of a similar variety, that is, those that are as starkly rich as butter and seductive to the palate. These would include those packaged as Brillat Savarin, Excelsior and Fromage de Monsieur Fromage. Also, a fine and beguiling Triple Creme Parfait, a heavily creamed cheese with a restrained and altogether admirable tang. It, too, is comfortable in the company of fine red wines. At its best, Mr. Schratter's Saint Marcellin is something to reckon with. It is a small, round cheese couched in chestnut leaves, and one recent random sample was a few days beyond its prime. The gentleman's Chabichou is a goat cheese, a mild version that is delectable and possessed of the characteristic pungency of all in its class. Mr. Schratter's cheeses are available in more than 40 outlets throughout the city and presumably wherever fine cheeses are sold.

926-> CAREY WILL SEEK GAINS IN CONTRACT; Electrical Workers' Leader Rejects Johnson's Plea
DETROIT, Jan. 29—The International Union of Electrical orkers does not feel bound by President Johnson's recent call for moderation in labor demands, James B. Carey, the union's president, indicated today. Mr. Carey said he did not believe the President's plea applied to the automobile and electrical companies with which the union will bargain this year, because they are more profitable than most concerns. But he said at a news conference that the President's call for price reductions in highly profitable industry should be heeded by the auto company. Mr. Carey's remarks are in line with the thinking of the United Automobile Workers, which intends to press ahead year for its biggest contract gain since 1955. The autoworkers believe the industry can afford a big contract without raising prices, and conclude that their demands would not be inflationary if prices do not go up. Walter P. Reuther, U.A.W, president, is expected to set forth his views on the matter in a leter to President Johnson this week. The International Union of Electrical Workers normally does not pioneer labor agreements with the auto. companies, and generally accepts a contract similar to one reached by the auto union. “The companies I deal with are not guided by the President or his economic advisers,” Mr. Carey said, and therefore the President's request for labor moderation does not apply to these companies, either, Re called for “a substantial reduction in prices” of autos and appliances “to expand the markets for these products.” Mr. Carey's union will negotiate major contracts this year covering 75,800 members. Mr. Carey said bargaining had begun with the Philco Corporation subsidiary of Ford Motor Company, where the union represents 10,000 workers. The union will shape demands next month covering 25,000 workers at the General Motors Corporation, 21,000 at the Radio Corporation of America, and 19,800 at the Sperry‐Rand Corporation. Mr. Carey also disclosed that the union would ask its inembers at a September convention to approve a new method of computing dues that will result in a substantial increase in dues payments. He said the union hoped to drop its policy of collecting $4 to $5 a month from each member and begin collecting 1.5 per cent of a member's weekly income.

927-> POLICE SHIFT HUNT IN SLAYING AT HOTEL
New York City detectives spent yesterday checking the names, mostly in Philadelphia and Baltimore, of persons in the address book of Mrs. Edna V. Petro, who was fatally shot last Thursday night in Delmonico's Hotel. The address boor, a roll of white adhesive tape, plenty of partial fingerprints and a pair of leather gloves apparently are the only real clues in the case. However, the police virtually ruled out the gloves yesterday‐, saying there was no label in them and no way to identify their owner. Assistant Chief Inspector Walter F. Henning said txe police had enough partial fingerprints to identify the killer if he were captured. Mrs. Petro, 16 years old, a divorcee of Baltimore, was a beauty consultant for Charles of the Ritz, Inc. She had come here with several other employes for a special training program.

928-> Care in Shoveling Snow Urged for Over‐40's
Life may begin at 40, but snow shoveling should play no vigorous part in it, according to the Health Department. Health officials warned yesterday that persons who had reached 40 and were not accustomed to heavy exercise should be careful if they do shovel snow because they can injure the cardio‐vascular system. If it is necessary for a person over 40 to clear the walks and driveways he should take his time and lift only small amounts of snow, the Health Department said. Elderly persons should not shovel any snow and should stay indoors because of the danger of frostbite and falling on ice, the department warned.

929-> NATIOAL CITY NET IS $5.90 A SHARE; Some Analysts Surprised at Its Failure to Rise More
The First National City Bank reported yesterday that its net operating earnings rose to $76,942,000, or $5.90 a share, in 1963. The 1962 figures were $74,108,000, or $5.68 a share. Some securities analysts expressed disappointment that the bank, second in New York only to the Chase Manhattan Bank, had not lifted earnings to $6 a share. Whatever the analysts had been anticipating — and some had expected $6 or a little more —a high official of the bank said it was not disappointed.“We're pretty well pleased with this year's results. $5.90 is not below our estimate,” he said. The City Bank report had been expected several days earlier. Traditionally it has been released within the first two or three business days of each quarter. A spokesman said that with the bank's annual meeting coming later this month than it did in January, 1962, “we didn't see any reason to rush out the figures.” He also pointed out that for the first time the bank included its subsidiaries in its assets total and said that took a little extra time. City Bank reported resources, or assets, or $11,797,700,000, including $53 million for subsidiaries. At the end of 1962 the bank's resources stood at $10,448, 900,000. Officials suggested that one reason the independent analysts earnings projections had been off was that the bank changed in 1963 from an accrual method of estimating certain expenses to a cash basis. The accounting switch was also said to explain why the bank's fourth quarter earnings, $19,594,000, fell markedly below those of the fourth quarter of 1962, which were $21,327,000. Deposits increased by $1,240,-000,000 to a record of $10,425,000,000. The bank declined to say how much it had added to its bad debt reserve for loans secured by vegetable oils that appeared to be uncollectable. “The situation is so involved that we don't think we should attempt a definitive statement at this stage of the proceedings.” the bank said. It was pointed out that on Nov. 22 City Bank filed a claim in Superior Court in Jersey City for a $2.5 million loan to Ira Haupt & Company secured by warehouse receipts of Harbor Tank Corporation for crude soybean oil valued at $3.6 mil‐ lion. Ira Haupt, a prominent brokerage house, is in liquidation as a result of loans to Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Corporation. The latter and the Harbor Tank concern have gone into bankruptcy. A City Bank spokesman said the bank had no uncollected loans to Allied Crude or to its president, Anthony DeAngelis, who has been indicted on Federal charges of transporting forged warehouse receipts. Royal National The Royal National Bank reported net operating income of $2,124,856 in 1963, or $2.75 a share. The Royal absorbed the Gotham Bank on Feb. 1. Pro forma figures for the two banks for 1962 showed a net income of $2,109,517, or $2.73 a share. Kings County Trust Net operating earnings of the County Trust Company, Brooklyn, rose to $1,268,699, or $4.32 a share in 1963, compared with $1,254,359, or $4.28 in 1962. The per share figures were adjusted to reflect 5 per cent stock dividend declared lat November. Stockholders of the Bank of Commerce approved an increase in authorized capital yesterday that will permit payment of a previously announced 5 per cent stock dividend. It is to be paid Feb. 28 to stockholders of record Jan. 22. An increase in capital fronm 210,000 sharesto 220.500 shares was also approved. The National State Bank of Newark, largest national bank in New Jersey, yesterday reported net profit of $4,189,000 for 1963, Compared with $4,123,000 in 1962, equal to $2.91 a share compared with $2.89. The bank reported that for the first time in its 152‐year history its total deposits, as of Dec. 31, 1963, exceeded the half billion dollar mark, at $506,105,000. At the end of 1962 total deposits were $470,179,000. The bank had a substantial increase in loans, which totaled $285,258000 outstanding at the end of 1963 compared with $236,430,000 at the end of 1962.

933-> Six Negroes Barred At Alabama School
NOTASULGA, Ala., Feb. 5—Mayor James Rea today turned back six Negroes who sought to enter the all‐white Macon County High School under a Federal court order. He said later that their presence would have created a fire hazard. Tonight, the city's water plant was heavily damaged by fire, according to Mayor Rea. He ordered all schools closed as a result of the fire. “Definitely, the plant is out of operation for three days,” he said. Justice Department attorneys moved immediately to meet the challenge posed when the Mayor blocked admission of the Negroes. It was the first major move against Federal authority on the issue since President Johnson took office. The lawyers filed a suit tonight in th Federal District Court in Montgomery, 50 miles to the west, for a preliminary injunction prohibiting further interference by Mayor Rea. A hearing was set for 10 A.M. Friday before Judge Frank M. Johnson. It thus appeared that the second showdown over the admission of the six students might not come before next week in this farming and textile town of 1,000 persons in east‐central Alabama. Six other Negro students were admitted this morning to the all‐white Shorter High School, 15 miles southwest of here, without serious incident. More than half of its white students attended classes throughout the day. This indicated at least a temporary failure of segregationists' efforts to promote a mass boycott. Sixty state troopers, trained and equipped for riot duty, sealed off the Shorter High School area. Their chief, Col. Albert J. Lingo, director of the Department of Public Safety, and 75 troopers stood guard at Notasulga (pronounced NOTE‐uhSULL‐gah), which was consiere far more tense. The troopers had been sent, at the request of local officials, by Gov. George C. Wallace. The Governor is under a temporary restraining order issued by Judge Johnson prohibiting any move to prevent desegregatian. He confined his public participation in the dispute to ssuing statements, predicting local resistance and possible violence. However, only a few spectators gathered here in front of the Macon County High School at 7:30 A.M. One reason was that the word had been passed yesterday that the Negroes would be barred. It was also raining and cold. On the high school flagpole, instead of the United States flag, the state flag and the Stars and Bars of the Confederate battle standard flew. A small but angry crowd of three dozen men gathered in a yard across the street in front of the school. All were dressed in rough work clothes—overalls and khakis. A few were unshaven. Several carried hickory walking sticks. They cursed newsmen and hacked at them with the walking sticks. On the opposite side of the street, Colonel Lingo waited with a friend, Sheriff Jim Clark of Dallas County, in the western Alabama Black Belt. Mayor Rea, who was standing in the schoolhouse door, surrounded by local policemen and deputies, invited Sheriff Clark. into the area. He said later, “We thought we might need his mounted posse.” The posse had figured prominently in a Birmingham riot last May, when it drove Negroes at rifle point and shotgun point from the A. G. Gaston Motel. A yellow school bus driven by a N egro pulled up at the entrance shortly before 9 o'clock. Sheriff Clark, clutching an electric cattle prod wrapped in black tape, jumped aboard, followed by a local deputy. Crouched in the aisle was a white photographer. Vernon Merritt 3d of Birmingham, son of former Gov. Gordon Persons' executive secretary. Sheriff Clark began jabbing the prod into Mr. Merritt's stomach and then started flailing him with it. The deputy, who had snatched the photographer's two cameras, smashed them over the metal bars at the back of the bus seats. The sheriff then threw the man off the bus and stood over him jabbing him occasionally with the prod. The bus pulled up to the high school door. Mayor Rea approached and told the students he was invoking a“safety and fire prevention ordinance” adopted Jan. 27. The bus then returned the students to Tuskegee, the county seat, nine miles to the south, where they live. Mr. Merritt was released after the departure of the bus. A threatening crowd of young men followed him up the street, cursing, but was halted by state troopers. Apparently on orders from Colonel Lingo, who said he feared that the photographer be killed, a trooper official picked up the photographer in a car and drove him away. Mr. Merritt said later he had not been injured seriously. He is a free‐lance photographer working for the Black Star photographic agency. At Montgomery, Ala., The Associated Press reported that governor Wallace had instructe Colonel Lingo to proect news personnel. Refering to the Merritt incident the Governor said: “This sort of thing must not be allowed to happen.” According to Mayor Rea. segregation was not a factor in the turning back of the six students: Anthony T. Lee, Robert Judkins Jr., illie B. Wyatt Jr., Patricia Jones, Marsha Sullins and Shelby Chambliss. The Mayor explained his position in a news conference. He said the fire ordinance was necessary because of a temporary water shortage caused by repairs to the water system. In line with its provisions, he said, he inspected Macon County High and determined that it would be unsafe to house more than 175 persons He noted that the present student body and teaching staff numbered 171. The 12 Negro students were enrolled at all‐white Tuskegee High last September. desegregatin the school. In the week of controversy tht followed the school's closing by Governor Wallace and its reopening by Federal action, new opposition developed. All of Tuskegee High School's white students withdrew. Last week the State Board of Education issued a ruling closing the school because, the board said, it was uneconomic to operate it with 13 teachers and 12 students. Governor Wallace is ex‐office chairman of the board The Macon County Board voted last Friday for closing. The boycotting white students had been allowed to transfer to Shorter High and to Macon County High here. Judge Johnson, in issuing his restraining order against Governor Wallace and the two boards, said he would not prevent the closing of Tuskegee High. But he said the Negroes' applications for admission to the two other white schools must be approved.

936-> CARNEGIE RECITAL BY GRACE BUMBRY; Young Mezzo Demonstrates Her Technical Command
In her recital in Carnegie Hall last night Grace Bumbry repeated to a large extent the impression she made in her debut here in the fall of 1962. The young American mezzo‐soprano has a voice that deserves the overworked slang adjective “gorgeous,” and she handles it with a good deal of technical command. Yet she still needs some vocal and interpretative discipline to make the most of her outstanding gifts. The voice gives pleasure by itself, with its dark chest tones, velvety middle range and brilliant top. The singer uses it with a vitality that communicates itself to the listener, and where this vitality found a proper outlet the performances were exciting. This was true of the two operatic arias in the program, “Mon coeur s’ouvre ta voix” from Saint‐Saëns's “Samson et Dalila” and “Voi lo sapete” from Mascagni's “Cavalleria Rusticana.” At these points in the evening Miss Bumbry was completely attuned to the musical style. But in five songs by Schubert and four by Brahms the mezzo‐soprano might just as well have been singing opera, too, with exaggerated dramatics taking the place of restraint and intimacy, with a simple melody being subjected to intense emotionalism. There were exceptions to this. In Brahms's “An eine Aeolsharfe” Miss Bumbry found and sustained a melancholy mood that made this an affecting performance. Even in the first two of the four spirituals that ended the program the singer was inclined to overdo one or another aspect of the music. She poured so much intensity into “Ride On, King Jesus,” that it lost rhythmic shape and the last note flew sharp. The simplicity of “Let Us Break Together” suffered from an unbearably slow tempo. With a singer less gifted one would not bother to detail the flaws. But Miss Bumbry is good enough to make one care what she does with her talents. Franz Rupp was again at the piano, giving the singer strong, boldly outlined musical support.

937-> CARDINAL JULLIEN OF THE CURIA DIES; French‐Born Former Dean of Roman Rota Was 81
ROME, Saturday, Jan. 11 (AP)—Andrd Cardinal Jullien, a French member of the Vatican Curia, died today at a hospital where he was taken last month suffering from leukemia. He was 81 years old. Born Near Lyons Cardinal Jullien, the former dean of the Roman Catholic Church's Roman Rota, or high court, was a member of the Curia without a specific position at the time of his death. He was born Oct. 25, 1882, at Pelussin, in the Archdiocese of Lyons. He was ordained a priest on Oct. 1, 1905, at Lyons. After his ordination, he continued his studies at the Pontifical Apollinare College in Rome. Upon his return to Lyons, he held the chair of Canon law for four years in the Lyons Seminary. In 1912, he became a member of the Roman Rota, and 10 years later became one of its judges. He was promoted to chief judge by Pope Pius XII in 1944. He was niade cardinal in the consistory of Dec. 15, 1958, by Pope John XXIII. Cardinal Jullien was a member of the Vatican Congregations of the Sacraments, of the Council, of Religious Orders and of Rites. He was also a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretaion of the Code of Canon Law and of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signature. He was the author of numerous publications and studies on legal matters that achieved international recognition. The Cardinal, who was being treated at a private hospital, I was visited by’ Pope Paul a week before Christmas. The death of Cardinal Jullien brought the number of Cardinals in the Sacred College to 79 and reduced to nine the number of non‐Italian Cardinals in the Curia, which includes 21 Italians. Of the entire college 27 are now Italians and 52 non‐Italian. His death also reduced the number of French Cardinals in the college to seven.

940-> INDIANA COURT VOIDS VETO ON DISTRICTING
INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 10 (UPI)—The Indiana Supreme Court today gave the state a legislative reapportionment law by ruling, 3 to 2, that Gov. Matthew E. Welsh waited too long to veto the bill. Judge Norman Artenburn, who wrote the majority decisision, said “This means we have a reapportionment act.” The majority opinion means that three bills Mr. Welsh had vetoed after the three‐day veto limit became effective as laws. Actually, the court did not rule directly on the reapportionment veto. The ruling was made on a bill to permit the Indiana Supreme Court to appoint special prosecutors in counties where there had been failure to enforce criminal laws. The ruling upheld Judge Wilbur Grant of Marion Superior Court in a suit brought by the Northwest Indiana Crime Commission. The commission had fought to force Secretary of State Charles O. Hendricks to publish the prosecutor bill as part of the acts of the 1963 Legislature. One of the other two bills Mr. Welsh vetoed gave the state a reapportionment act to bring about the first reapportionment since 1921. The third vetoed bill provided medical care for the aged in a state adaptation of the Federal Kerr‐Mills Act on medical care.

941-> U. N. Reports Chinese
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Feb. 5—Developments in Communist China in 1962 and early 1963 indicate a recovery from the economic disasters of the preceding few years, according to the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. A survey by the Commission reports the opening in 1963 of coal mines providing raw materials for fertilizers, new oil wells, exploitation of natural gas, increased food output, a rise in steel production, although some plants are reported working far below capacity, and an especially rapid development of synthetic textiles. The survey, prepared for a meeting in Thailand last month of the commission's Committee on Industry and Natural Resources, was said to have been based on “information a ppear ing in standard journals.” Crude‐oil production rose fom 3.7 million tons in 1959 to 5.5 million tons in 1960, the commission reported. While exact figures since then are unavailable, that level of output is believed to have been maintained in 1961. The 1962 output was estimated at 5.3 million tons. Progress is also reported in chemicals. Pyrite and phosphate mines are believed to have been opened recently in an expansion of the fertilizer industry. In the first six months of 1963. the output of chemical fertilizers was reported to have risen 42 per cent above the same period of 1962. The increased supply of steel was directed toward the output of more farm tools and small machines, including pumps for irrigation. At the end of 1962. it was reported, 100,000 tractors were in use, as compared with 67,000 in 1961.

942-> U.N. Sees Trade Gap as World Issue
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Feb. 15—Dr. Raul Prebisch, an Argentine economist, declared today that the increasingly unfavorable trade balance of the less developed countries must be redressed by finding them customers for manufactured goods. Dr. Prebisch is secretary general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, scheduled to open March 23 in Geneva. He said in a report that the poorer countries' excess of imports over exports would exceed $20 billion by 1970 if their present concentration on commodity exports continues. Dr. Prebisch told the preparatory committee for the conference that this potential gap must be the starting point of the United Nations parley. In his report the economist summarized the problems to be tackled, the background of each and some of the solutions he and his consultants considered possible. The basic decision for the conference is the future pattern of trade, Dr. Prebisch said at a news conference. Unless agreement can be reached on this matter, he said, it is futile to discuss establishment of an international trade organization. Formation of such a unit is particularly desired by the Soviet Union to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the European Common Market, the European Free Trade Association and similar economic groupings of which the Soviet Union is not a member. In the view of the United States and other Western countries it is unrealistic to attempt to reconcile within one international organization the contrasting economic systems of capitalism and the planned economies. Dr. Prebisch said all phases of the economies of the emerging nations must be considered, since the goal of the conference is to help them speed their evolution toward self‐sufficiency. The greatest opportunity for their rapid progress, the economist said, lies in wider acceptance by the developed countries of manufactured goods from the less developed. This is one of the most sensitive points to be negotiated at Geneva. The industrialized countries protest that it confronts them with formidable competition for their own manufacturers because of lower labor costs in the underdeveloped regions. Dr. Prebisch reported, how ever, that after conversations he had held in several of the developed countries he sensed a lessening of this negative attitude and a growing awareness of possible advantages. The lower labor costs of goods manufactured in the poorer countries are often canceled out by far higher rates of interest on loans to manufacturers, he explained. In Latin America they often are more than 20 per cent. These and other manufacturing expenses in the emerging countries narrow the competitive margin, he declared Genuine conflicts in production costs as between the two groups of countries exist in only a few lines, he added.

The University of Massachusetts won its third “College Bowl” victory yesterday by beating Iowa State University 285 to 140. The Iowa State team, made up of Robert Schroeder, Ervin Wolff, Alan Beals and Robert Carr, got off to a good start by identifying Desdemona as the Shakespearean character who received a kiss from her killer. But the four students from Amherst, Mass., led by Mike Berrini, quickly regained control by identifying Mount Kilimanjaro as the highest mountain in Africa and Mount Everest as the highest peak in Asia. Mr. Berrini's colleagues were William Landis, Susan Tracy and David Mathieson.

945-> U.N. SEEKS ACCORD ON KASHMIR ISSUE; Council Debate Suspended as Private Talks Go On
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y.. Feb. 15—The Security Council heard a plea today from its President, Carlos Alfredo Bernardes of Brazil, for direct negotiations to settle the longstanding dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. At his suggestion, the Council adjourned until Monday morning to allow further consultations among members who have been trying to find grounds for reaching agreement without a vote. The unusual Saturday afternoon meeting was called because the representatives of India and Pakistan were eager to get back to their capitals. Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, said the Kashmnir question was so important that he would not object to the adjournment for further study. Mahomedali Currim Chagla, Indian Minister of Education, also accepted the move. In Council sessions since Feb. 3, the main line of thought has been to get the two sides to accept mediation, possibly through the Secretary General, U Thant. Today's unusual Saturday afternoon meeting was called because the representative of Pakistan, Foreign Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, has to return home. Most members of the 11‐nation body have hoped to avoid any resolution calling for action by the Council. Negotiations have been going on privately for a fortnight in search of an agreement that could be reached by consensus without a vote and that would persuade the two countries to negotiate directly or through a mediator. The most basic point of difference has been that India would not agree to any move that recognized the validity of past resolutions calling for a plebiscite on the future of Kashmir, and Pakistan would not accept any plan that did not call attention to the validity of those resolutions. The Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia have been supporting India's point of view. The nine other Council members have wanted to endorse past resolutions, though they have been willing to compromise if it would help to get agreement. Pakistan asked on Jan. 16 to have the Kashmnir question taken up again by the Council on the ground that India was endangering peace by moves to integrate Kashmir into the Indian Union against the wishes of the majority of the population of Kashmir. India has been represented by her Minister of Education, Mahomedali Currim Chagla. He has presented the Indian view that resolutions calling for a plebiscite have become obsolete. He asserted that the resolutions were conditional on “the vacation of aggression by Pakistan.” Since January, 1949, Kashmir has been divided by a cease‐fire line, with Pakistan holding about a third of Kashmir and India the rest. Resolutions since then have called repeatedly for a plebiscite. In the early days India repeatedly affirmed her willingness to have one. More recently India's argument has been that elections held in Kashmir amounted to the same thing as a plebiscite. The question of Kashmir is one of the oldest on the Securitv Council calendar. it was first brought before the Council. on Jan. 6, 1948, on a complaint by India that Pakistanis had been invading the state of Jammu and Kashmir. When India became independent in 1947 and the Moslem state of Pakistan split off from it, the Hindu Sultan of Jammu and Kashmir elected to join his state to India. The predominantly Moslem population objected. Tribesmen from Pakistan then joined this cause and war developed between India and Pakistan.

BOSTON, March 1 (AP)—The Boston Celtics defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 108‐93, today and maintained their 21/2game lead over the Cincinnati Royals in the Eastern Division race of the National Basketball Association. The Celtics and Royals are heading for an important twogame series this week. The teams will meet here on Wednesday and in Cincinnati Thursday. Tom Heinsohn's early scoring sparked the Celtics to a 27‐24 lead midway in the second period. Philadelphia fought back into contention when Boston scored only 4 points in the next 71/2 minutes. But at the end of this stretch, the Celtics still led, 51—48, and they gradually wore down the 76ers, who played with only seven men. Jim Loscutoff, who will end a nine‐year career with the Celtics at the end of this season, was honored at halftime. BOSTON (108)  G. F. P. Heinsohn 8 2‐2 18 Sanders 4 2‐3 10 Russell 6 3‐6 15 S.

947-> CENSUS TO BE TAKEN BY MAIL IN A TEST
LOUISVILLE, Feb. 15—A special census will be conducted in metropolitan Louisville May 14 to determine whether it is feasible to take the 1970 national census by mail. Instead of the usual house‐tohouse canvassing, special forms will be mailed to all households here. The completed forms will be returned by mail to the Bureau of the Census in Washington, where the data will be “read” by a scanning machine and tabulated by a computer. The purpose of the trial run here—first in a major metropolitan area—is to discover what percentage of households will return the mailed‐out census forms and what percentage will fill out the form properly. Census officials hope for an 85 per cent return. There was an 85 per cent return in a test in Huntington, L. I., but only a 75 per cent return in Little Rock, Ark. To determine the accuracy of the mail census, Census Bureau experts will spot check 2 per cent of the returns. Enumerators will make personal interviews to those who do not return the census form.

952-> CHANGE IN DRESS FAVORED BY NUNS; Visitors Here Agree Sisters Should Update Outlook
“There is one thing about a nun's habit,” Sister St. John of Dallas commented during a visit here last week. “She can never complain that she doesn't have a thing to wear.” Nevertheless, she thought it was time for a change. Sister Charles Borromeo of South Bend, Ind., agreed, adding the vast majority of nuns were tapping their feet in impatience waiting for a simplification of their dress. Beneath discussion of externals, however, the two sisterswho were here to make a television program about the nun in the modern world—find that the Roman Catholic sisterhood is being asked to take a vital part in the renewal of the church. Sister St. John, who is 38 years old and was born in Waco, Tex., is a member of the Sisters of St. Mary of Namur. She is an instructor in English at Dallas University and Southern Regional chairman of the Sisters Formation Conference, a group that helps nuns of various orders prepare for their work. Sister Charles Borromeo of the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross is dean of Graduate School of Theology at St. Mary's College in South Bend, Ind. She is 40 and was born in Chicago. Both of the nuns appeared to be nervous on Friday after their first experience at a television studio. They joked that their absence of make‐up on‐camera hopefully might prevent friends from recognizing them. The producer assured them that they had done fine. The program — “Directions 64”—will be televised by the Broadcasting Company next month. Much of the discussion centers on “The Nun in the Modern World,” a book written by Leo Joseph Cardinal Suenens of Belgium and published in 1962. It recommends that sisters,—and the church as a whole—become more relevant to modern times. Traditionally, the sisterhood has been something set apart from the world. The Cardinal asks nuns to break down some of the walls and become apostles in the world. “At least the book didn't drop like a lead balloon,” Sister Charles Borromeo said. “The early defensiveness in Catholic circles is dying out and the problems are now being discussed on the official level.” The sisters agreed that a change in the nun's habit, while long overdue, was a minor part of the drive toward renewal. “You don't renew a community by changing its habit,” Sister Charles Borromeo said. “We have to renew as persons.” They agreed, too, that some sort of costume was necessary to indicate their special calling. “You can't walk around and be just you,” Sister St. John said. “You always carry the church with you.”

953-> HOSPITALS SCORE REVISIONS IN CODE; Private Institutions Contend Board’;s Plan Would Drive Them Out of Existence; CHARGE DENIED BY CITY; Trussell, at Hearing, Says Statement is Ridiculous—Other Agencies in Favor
The Association of Private Hospitals charged yesterday that stricter professional and con struction standards prepared by the Board of Hospitals would “drive the private hospital out of existence” in the city. Morris B. Abram, special counsel for the association made the charge at a one‐day hearing at City Hall on the pro posed revision of the chapter of the city’;s Hospital Code governing these institutions. He said it would be unfair to set a higher standard for them than for the nonprofit voluntary and municipal hospitals. Dr. George Baehr, chairman of the hospital board’;s code committee, which conducted the hearing, denied any intention to harm the private hospitals. He emphasized that theboard envisaged waivers and variances so that no private hospital “which will meet reasonable standards” would be closed if the proposed chapter is adopted Dr. Ray E. Trussell, the Commissioner of Hospitals, winding up the hearing, called the charge “ridiculous” and said, “If we thought we were going to put them out of business, we wouldn’t have spent a year developing a new code.” The new standards on construction “will only apply fully to future hospitals,” Dr. Trussell said. The proposed code‐tightening drew commendations from spokesmen for the United Hospital Fund, the Greater New York Hospital Association, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York and the Associated Hospitals Service of New York (Blue Cross). Dr. Samuel L. Berson, president of the private hopitals association, asked that guide‐line policy interpretations be placed in the code to avoid labeling existing private hospitals as “obsolete.” He said he feared that under the new chapter, the proprietary hospitals would have to spend large sums to improve their facilities without being able to obtain permission to add to their number of beds. Dr. Jerome B. Flynn, president of the Bronx County Medical Society, and a number of other physicians, expressed concern over a proposed restriction of the specialist rating for Workmen’;s Compensation Board cases in private hospitals. Dr. Trussell said that the proposal, limiting the rating to physicians who had been qualified since May 1, 1960, was in line with state legislation recommended by the private hospitals association. He suggested that physicians qualified before that date would have no trouble going through a “one‐shot” review by the workmen’;s compensation committee of their county medical societies.

956-> WISCONSIN'S VOTE A TEST FOR RIGHTS; Wallace's Tally May Give Clue to Foes' Strength
MADISON, Wis., April 4—Wisconsin's Presidential preferential primary, to be run off Tuesday, is not expected to decide who will be this nation's next President, but it may indicate how much political dynamite is in the civil rights bill now under debate in the United States Senate. Representative John W. Byrnes, is unopposed as a favorite son candidate on the G.O.P. ballot. On the Democratic ballot Alabama's Gov. George C. Wallace is running against Wisconsin's Democratic Gov. John W. Reynolds, who heads a ticket pledged to support President Lyndon B. Johnson. Mr. Reynolds has leveled his attacks on the segregationist views of Governor Wallace. Mr. WalIace, has largely ignored his Wisconsin counterpart, and concentrated his fire on the civil rights bill and has championed states' rights. Leo Fahey, Director of Elections in the Wisconsin Secretary of State's office, predicts that a million votes will be cast Tuesday. If his prediction proves accurate it will be a surprisingly heavy vote. When the late John F. Kennedy ran in the 1960 Wisconsin Presidential primary in a highly publicized contest with Senator Hubert Humphrey, Minnesota Democrat, 1,182,160 votes were cast. Adding zest to the campaign is the fact that members of both parties can cross over and cast their ballot in the other party's primmary. In the past, Democrats, who have been a minority party, delighted in crossing over and voting in the Republican primary. Some political reporters foresee a heavy crossover in Tuesday's election, with Republicans moving into the Democratic column to vote for Mr. Wallace, not because they approve his segregationist views, but because they want to embarrass Mr. Reynolds. Estimates of Mr. Wallace's vote in Tuesday's election range from 86,000 to 175,000. One political expert said flatly that Mr. Wallace would carry the Sixth Congressional District, in the Fox River Valley, which is represented in Congress by William Van Pelt, a Republican. He is the only member of the state's Congressional delegation to vote against the civil rights bill. Mr. Wallace is expected to draw strength from strongholds of the late Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and in Milwaukee's South Side, where there is a heavy concentration of people of Polish origin, who have opposed state civil rights legislation. More significantly, Mr. Wallace has drawn opposition from important segments of the influential Catholic diocesan press who have branded the Alabama Governor “morally evil.” Governor Reynolds, a Catholic, is expected to draw support from the churchmen's stand.

The Dominican Government pointed out that the extradition treaty with Spain dates from 1875 and that Mr. TrujiiIo and the three other Dominicans were not political refugees but fugitives from justice. The nine men were taken from their prison cells on the eve of Mr. Trujillo's departure from the Dominican Republic and put to death.

958-> Wings Down Leafs, 2‐1, and Lead Stanley Cup Series, 3‐2; HOWE STANDS OUT FOR DETROIT CLUB; Scores First Goal and Stars on Defense—Joyal Tallies for Wings in 3d Period
TORONTO, April 21—Sid Abels hustling Detroit Red Wings headed for home ice tonight with a 3‐2 edge in the four‐of‐seven‐game final series for the Stanley Cup after beating the Toronto Maple Leafs, 2—1, at Maple Leaf Gardens. Gordie Howe and Ed Joyal scored the goals for Abel's socalled “old” team. Howe hit at 10:52 of the first period and, following a scoreless second period, Joyal registered at 7:50 of the last period. Toronto, pressing desperately in the last period, finally scored when George Armstrong beat the hard‐working Terry Sawchuk at 14:57 while the Wingswere two men short. A crewd of 14,311 saw Punch Imlach, the Toronto coach, remove Johnny Bower, the goalie, with 30 seconds to go and send in six forwards. But Sawchuk held th}em off. The sixth game will be played in Detroit Thursday night. The Leafs had many scoring chances, but the hustling Wings, led by. Sawchuk in goal and the 36year‐old Howe, foiled them with a well‐knit defense. In the second period, after a goal by Gerry Ehman of the Leafs had been nullified by an offside Howe made a brilliant defensive play. He took out Bob Pulford with a body roll and halted him again on a breakaway. Sawchuk turned away Pulford's shot following Howe's second check. Bower had a busy first period,After Dave Keon had missed” on a shot at an open net, Bbwer stopped Alex Delvecchio's hard drive and Howe, stationed just outside the crease, missed a shot. Bower finally yielded to the pressure and Howe sank the first goal on a rebound of his own shot after a pass from Delvecchio. Bower apparently thoughht he had Howe beaten, but Gordie cornered the puck and flipped it over the sprawled Bower. After Ehman had missed twicee once with an open net—early.in the third period, the Wings made it 2—0 when Joyal beat Bower on a 20‐footer from the right lane. Bill Gadsby and Marcel Pronnnevost were in the penalty box for Detroit when Armstrong made good on passes by Frannkk Mahovlich and Andy Bathgate. It was Armstrong's fourth goal of the playoffs. Howe has eight. The Leafs lost Don McKenney for the series. The former New York Ranger suffered torn ligaments in the right knee after he was tripped by Al Langlois at 15:35 of the first period. McKenney had scored four goals and had made eight assists in the playoffs. DETROIT (2)  TORONTO (I)  Sawchuk . .Goal ... . Bower   Langlois .Defense Brewer 1) 3 M. Pronovost ..Defense..

961-> Witness
Dunia Wasserstrom, a Jewish survivor of Auschwitz, gave the following testimony in the Frankfurt courtroom where a score of former members of the concentration camp staff are on trial: I remember a day on which Jewish children were brought to Auschwitz. They arrived in a truck that stopped a moment in front of the political department. A small boy, clasping an apple in his hands, jumped off the truck. Boger and another S.S. man by the name of Draser watched the scene from the door of the political department. I was standing at a window outside. The child stood by the truck fondling the apple in his hand and seemed to enjoy himself. Boger approached the boy, grabbed him by his feet, and smashed him head first against the wall of the barracks. Unruffled, he then picked up the apple and Draser told me to wash “that” off the wall. About an hour later I was called to Boger to interpret an interrogation during which I saw him calmly munch the boy's apple. The bestial stories emerging from the West German war crimes trial become more revolting every day. What they tell us is of a time—our own—when humans were considered “that” by others in power who considered themselves superior humans. Children‐killers were not only sadists but something else: functionaries of a state that promoted genocide and condoned unspeakable cruelties committed in its name. This is the lesson beyond the sorrow. A witness to an unknown boy's death makes all men, long afterward, witness.

962-> AROUND THE GARDEN
: Plant dahlia tubersi in an open, sunny site. …¶ pinch hack terminal shoots on snapdragons, petunias, Salvias, marigolds, zinnias to encourage branching.… ¶Mark, seeded rows with wooden or plastic labels. …¶Use sevin to control adults of the holly leaf miner. …¶Malathion or sevin control birch leaf miner. … ¶Use trimmer to tidy wisps of grass around fences and shade trees. The first long weekend of the gardening season sends urbanites scurrying to their summer hideaways. This is an excellent time to check out#the tool shed to be sure all power and hand tools are in good working order. The lawn may look a bit scraggly without regular tending and a proper mowing and raking will be order. Also, weeds may#have taken over the Once regal flower beds. Out they Tubs and planters will need refurbishing with such faithful blooming plants as petun‑ias, geraniums, lantanas or begonias. Vinca is a good trim for a viney touch. If the short‐season vege‐ tables have not been sown, they should be. Leaf lettuce, a few onion sets, beets and chard can be sown now. Also, save a few square feet for a tomato plant or two, and may‐ be some pepper plants. Pots of herbs are handy by the kitchen door for salads and barbecue sauces. Remember the trick to easy gardening at the weekend hideaways is Minimum planting with those sturdy performers that grow and bloom on schedule with little care. Unless chrysanthemums are “pinched” they become leggy. Pinching is the term applied to taking out the vegeta‐ tive shoots on the growing tips. This deed stops plant growth at this point and forces buds to break below. The first pinch is made now, when the young plants are about six inches high. As the plants mature, the side branches will spread out and form bushier plants. The ’mums will need to be headed back a second time, usually about a month later during the first week of July. For the second pinch, the growing tip of each side branch will be removed. This again stops growth and forces branching. The result is fully developed chrysanthemum plants with a great number of flower buds. Only two pinches are necessary as the Plants must be allowed time to grow and set flower buds by fall. Mid to late July the deadline for any pinch‐ Ing.Plants nipped back after this date will not set buds and flower properly. For the standard or “foot‐ ball” as they have come to be called, the opposite Procedure is followed. Rather than pinching back the ter‐ minal#Shoots to encourage branching, the single termi‐ nal bud is allowed to develop by taking out all the side buds. With but one bud to develop, the result is a large, oversized flower. Of course florists who want their flowers to bloom on an exact day follow a rigid schedule of pinching. They also introduce black cloth, lat‐ er in the growing season to shorten the day‐length of the plants. Such precision culture is well‐suited to commercial endeavors, but the home gard‐ ener is not fussy, nor need he be. As long as the chrysanthe‐ mums burst into bloom when fall foliage is displayed he has no complaints.

963-> CENTRAL BANKERS OPEN DOORS A BIT; Settlements Bank Admits Japanese and Canadians as Observers at ‘Club’; NEW ATTITUDES NOTED; Move Reflects Continuing Tendency Toward Global Monetary Cooperation
PARIS, May 3— Japan and Canada have been admitted as observers in the exclusive Bank for International Settlements—the central bankers' club that meets each month in Basel, Switzerland. Their new status reflects the fact that, more and more, international finance is being handled through intimate harmonization and cooperation among governments. The immediate spur to their being invited to the bank's meetings was that they are members of the special 10‐nation committee formed last September to devise more adequate international monetary machinery. The bank's dinectors are central bankers of Western Europe's seven most potent financial powers—Belgium, Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and West Germany. U. Went to Meetings For some two years now, the United States has been attending bank meetings and sharing with the seven full members in responsibility for the international gold pool that was created in late 1961 to combat speculation in the gold markets. The regular United States representative at the monthly meetings is Charles A. Coombs, vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Japan and Canada are not participating in the pool at this point. But Japan, and presumably Canada, has substantial dollar deposits with the bank itself. The bank was created in the early nineteen‐thirties to manage the complicated finance of Germany's post‐World War I reparations payments — the Dawes and Young loans. Japan, incidentally, was one of the founding members. Other Roles Held In the post‐World War II era, the bank has had a number of significant technical roles as an international financial institution in its own right largely within Europe, but increasingly in the outside world. More recently it has developed a significant informal role as the central bankers' meeting place. On the second Monday of every month the bankers converge on the bank's headquarter at Basel. What they say to each other is a well‐kept secret. So is the attendance list. It is known, however, that since the invitation was extended to Canada and Japan several months ago, Louis Rasminsky, who heads the Bank of Canada, has attended once, and Masamichi Yamagiwa, Governor of the Bank of Japan, plans to attend for the first time next month. Except on the occasions when these two principals are present, their countries are represented by lesser officials and on a more distant fringe of the intimate circles.

967-> ARGENTINA FACES GROWING DEFICITS; Decline in Political Unrest Gives Hope for 1964
BUENOS AIRES—Argentina began emerging from her storm cellar in 1963 after the economic and political tornadoes of the last two years. She found much of her shanty‐built structure and commercial structure in considerable disarray, but under the flimsier timbers there was still a large, solid structure of industry left to build on. The country remains a contradiction. A considerable amount of its newly built‐up industry is not only solid but is also changing the country over to modern ways. Argentina in many respects has Western European living standards, and it has an immense agricultural wealth and a large middle class. Yet her economic picture for 1964 remains confused, even murky in some areas. Severe problems remain unsolved, and a sense of urgency in cleaning up abuses that could bring on new crisis is not apparent. Much depends on whether the country can avoid the renewal of the political turbulence that toppled a President in 1962 and later triggered several attempts at a coup. The newly elected President, Arturo Illia, is already finding that the political honeymoon is ending. The country has a persistently high unemployment rate (around 8 per cent), a huge and worsening financial deficit and a cost ‐ of ‐ living index that climbed by a fifth in 1963. The index for Buenos Aires is up by 100 per cent since 1960. More discouraging is the fact that real wages in mid‐1963 were 3 per cent below 1962's. Harvests were smaller and wool output per animal was less last year than before World War II. The gross national product per capita dipped again in 1963, by 4 per cent, according to the preliminary estimate. After more than a year of recession, there were upturns in several sectors in the last half of 1963, but the picture was mixed. One bright spot was foreign trade: severely reduced imports plus an excellent meat export year gave the country a favorable trade balance estimated at more than $400 million. The automobile industry rallied strongly after midyear. At the end of November the number of Ramblers, Fiats, Valiants, Falcons and other autos manufactured in Argentina totaled 62,000. The comparative figures for 1962 and 1961 were 73,000 and 66,000. Steel production reached a record, with the total approaching 900,000 tons, compared to 645,000 in 1962. The industry proudly began turning out sheets for car bodies for the first time, and looked forward to other expansions in 1964. Also, a reserve of at least 50 million tons of ore has been found in Patagonia. Another good meat export year is in prospect, and the Government is scoring impressive gains in its battle to wipe out hoof and mouth disease. Argentina's peso has held firm or gained in recent months However, economic observers concede that the nation's recovery problems are still far from licked. Its foreign debt exceeds $2.5 billion, of which $1.3 billion is due by the end of 1966. In other words, roughly a third of the nation's export earnings would be eaten up by debt payments. With her foreign currency and gold reserves severely depleted, Argentina plans to negotiate her foreign debt. A record Federal budget deficit seems certain in 1964. In the fiscal year that ended last Nov. 1, the budgeted expenditures were almost twice as high as the total cash revenue. Nearly half the Federal deficit is caused by the inefficient, featherbedded, stateowned railway system, but authorities remain reluctant to take drastic remedial action in the face of labor opposition. The new head of the railways has announced a cutback in buying equipment and talked optimistically of wiping out the operating deficit by tripling the freight revenue. However, he gave no concrete details and conceded that half the locomotives and three‐quarters of the rolling stock were in need of repair. Economy Minister Eugenio Blanco said in a year‐end summary that Argentina's problem was essentially a moral one. He said the country had suffered a collective demoralization in recent years that led to the flight of capital abroad and to the exodus of hundreds of its top technicians to the United States. Foreign Minister Miguel Zavala Ortiz estimated that Argentines had banked $2 billion overseas. Others have put it at $1 billion. Foreign investment has dropped off drastically in the last year. In November, the Illia Government, carrying out a campaign pledge, canceled the contracts under which foreign companies had been producing oil or drilling wells in Argentina for the State Petroleum Authority. The companies, mostly from the United States, had invested more than $250 million in Argentine operations. Mr. Illia said that the contracts signed with the old Frondizi regime were unconstitutional in that they were disguised concessions, and that they were extremely burdensome to Argentina. The companies replied that they signed with a legal government. The courts` are now to decide “who owes whom.” The government is willing to repay the “real investment,” but it also has an extensive list of damages and claims against the companies that might exceed the investment. The Illia Government insisted it had nothing against United States interests and only wanted to follow a fully legal course. Its action nevertheless jolted international investors. The Illia Administration, which is pledged to protect the development of Argentina's basic resources, has also miffed the State Department by refusing to ratify an ArgentineUnited States agreement guaranteeing American investments here. This is not necessary, the Illia Government says, adding that Argentina will obviously fulfill its agreements. An agriculture minister complained in 1963 that Argentina had allowed herself to fall a quarter of a century behind the times in farming techniques. Yields are down. Even though a much‐improved wheat crop is foreseen for 1964, it will be far short of the harvests of the thirties. The newspaper La Prensa said in a year‐end editorial that the country was suffering from too much laziness—from high costs resulting from paying for work that is not done. Soaring living costs continue to be the main problem and at the year's end consumers were alarmed by the climbing prices of meat and other foods. The Government talked of price controls, then introduced a bill in Congress that would give it sweeping investigatory and control powers over pricing annd business operations. The bill was sharpy attacked by business as unwarranted intervention and Congress balked.

968-> Eisenhower Isn't Talking, but...; Some Visitors Think He Will Give View on G.O.P. Contest
  INDIO, Calif., April 30 —Some of those who have talked recently with former President Dwight D. Eisenhower have come away with a distinct impression that he may yet say publicly what kind of candidate he believes should be his party's nominee in November. It is no more than an impression, for General Eisenhower seems to do a lot more listening than talking on the subject of candidates. But his mobile face can speak volumes to the visitor whose purpose is to have the former President express publicly his preference for some candidate. When someone first men tioned the possibility of a Goldwater nomination on the second ballot, General Eisenhower's expression was much the same as that shown in the famous news photograph that caught his reaction to President Truman's dismissal of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. But he said nothing. By now General Eisenhower has been asked by supporters of every potential candidate still in the Republican contest—and of some who are not—to give his public endorsement to their candidate. His consistent reply has been that as the most recent Republican President he will not indulge in personalities, that he will remain neutral. An even stronger impression left with some recent visitors is that he will not depart from this rule unless he is convinced that his pronouncement will not on balance add to the divisive influences already apparent in the Republican party. General Eisenhower has long felt that only a united Republican party can win a Presidential election. He knows from personal experience that only through such unity can it make up for its historic weakness in the South and its organizational weakness in the big cities. Thus, the chances seem better than even that if he has anything to say publicly about the party's choice of a nominee, it will not constitute a personal endorsement of any one contender. Much more likely would be a broad statement saying what he has said many times in the past —that the problems of the nation at home and in its relations with the rest of the world call for the nomination and election of a forward‐looking and progressive Republican who can inteipret the main stream of Republican thinking and who is qualified by experience and temperament to cope with such problems. There is no certainty at this time that General Eisenhower will depart from his self‐imposed neutrality even to this extent, but the pressure on him to do so has been increasing. General Eisenhower has said several times that he would not be a part of any movement to stop Goldwater or stop anybody else before or during the convention. He has also said that he could actively support say candidate that could gain his party's nomination. Any statement by Generall Eisenhower about the kind of candidate he favors would probably be interpreted by the extreme right‐wing supporters of Senator Goldwater as an attempt to diminish the Senator's chances to win the nomination. On the other hand, General Eisenhower appealed to Senator Goldwater months ago to make clear during his primary campaigns just where he stood on all major issues. One view from Palm Desert is that this process is far from complete. . General Eisenhower finds much of the current published speculation about candidates . and about his own attitude on them more than a little irritating. An amazingly vigorous man for his 74 years, the former President is pictured by visitors as appearing doubly vigorous when striding about his tiny office at Indio gesturing with both hands to make a point. That is usually what happens when he is explaining how he has tried to avoid “discussing personalities” because he wanted to get people to think and talk more in terms of ideas and issues rather than candidates. He has tried to keep himself out of the national political picture as much as possible because he wants the party to concentrate on the men who will have to shoulder its responsibilities from now on. General Eisenhower tolerates few criticisms of the Republican party from others. But as a self‐styled “has‐been,” one criticism that he has been known to permit himself is that there has been too much “looking back,” instead of looking ahead, by too many Republicans. He has been known to remark with some impatience that he does not want to be thought of as the party leader, preferring to be regarded as the former party leader. This seems just another way of saying that he prefers the casual slacks and open‐throated western shirt he wears in and around his cottage bordering the fairway at Eldorado Country Club at Palm Desert to the business suit and four‐in‐hand tie he wears to the little office at Indio. He thinks politics in its proper sense is important and fascinating. But he has developed an even stronger aversion to “politics”—as popularly understood—than he had when he was President. General Eisenhower has been asked time and again whether he dislikes Senator Goldwater and, if so, why. He has been heard to say that he likes Mr. Goldwater but deplores the Senator's confessed weakness of “shooting from the hip” on important issues without sufficient reflection and, in General Eisenhower's view, the Senator's apparent unwillingness or inability to state clearly what he, as President, would do on such specific questions of domestic policy as medical care for the aged, urban renewal and farm laws. Regarding this matter of a positive approach, General Eisenhower feels little better about the other prospective candidates. General Eisenhower also likes Henry Cabot Lodge, Ambassador to South Vietnam, Governor Rockefeller of New York, Gov. William W. Scranton of Pennsylvania and Gov. George Romney of Michigan. But in what order he is not about to say in any offhand manner or in the immediate future. For much as he may dislike the pulling and hauling Of practical politics, he is not so innocent as to suppose that a statement by him on the candidates would not have some effect on their chances for the nomination. So for the time being General Eisenhower is trying to avoid trouble while enjoying his golf and the plush world of the desert country. When someone asked him recently what he would do or say in the event of a deadlocked convention, he shrugged and said he would cross that bridge when he came to it.

969-> Maps and Travel Advice: $15 Million for Goodwill
YOU can't get there from here,” the farmer chuckles, and then goes on to direct the wandering, mapless motorist: “Go back about steen miles and this time take the left fork. That's right, the left. Watch for a general store about four doors up from a gas station maybe a quarter‐half‐mile used to be a barn and a mile up ahead you'll see a big highway that's Route 26 can't miss it.” But the motorist does miss it. He recalls “left”; his passengers insist “right.” The children are restless, his wife is disdainful, he is hungry and the temperature gauge is edging up. Unless the motorist is an incorrigible do‐it‐yourselfer with a spiritual kinship to Columbus, the chances are that next time he'll join the growing millions who have found that you can get there from here with the help of the expert routers of the American Auto‐ mobile Association and the major oil companies. Their knowledge and their maps , representing an outlay of $15 million for goodwill in 1963; have evolved from more than half a century of road nmapmaking. The bicycle craze (10 million two‐wheelers in 1900 for a population of 76 million ) resulted in the “Cyclists’ Road Map of Connecticut” in 1888 and a similar map for New Jersey in 1889. In 1900, about 50 manufacturers turned out 4.000 cars, although there were only about 250 miles of paved roads outside the cities. Two years later, the A.A.A. was bornn and brought out the first primitive road map for tourists — a map of Staten Island, By 1906, more than 100.000 cars and trucks were moving across short stretches of tarred roads and through puddlles or ovver frozen lumps of clay. The firstx filling station opened in 1907 two years after the first tourimg guidebook was published for “automobilists,” by the Hartford Rubber Company. It sold for $2. And the Official Automobile Blue Book, also a guide, was published annually by the A.A.A. Today, the drivers of the nation's 73 million cars can choose from a wide selection of routes — direct, scenic, offbeat — detailed from door to door. They can easily get information on where to stay and what to do. There are maps for the autumn route, the white‐capped‐mountain tour, the summer way through beach or woods, and the byways of springtime. The Auto Club and oil company specialists pore over maps with the prospective traveler, suggesting routes and answering questions. Last year, the A.A.A. distributed more than 13 million maps. They are revised monthly by 38 full‐time employes who are in daily contact with 750 clubs and with state highway departments. The major oil companies turn out millions of maps, marvels of four‐color art, of geography and of encyclopedic tourist information. Texaco has touring service information available at offices in five major cities. Last year, inquiries at the five bureaus exceeded half a million. One Texaco specialist has driven more than 400,000 miles through the United States and Canada gathering information for tourists. The staffs in the five centers (New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and New Orleans) review each day reports of highway conditions, and data on floods, storms or forest fires that may affect routing. Rand McNally makes Texaco's maps, and one of the biggest will be the Texaco road map at the World's Fair this year. Esso operates four information bureaus in the United States, one in Brussels and one in Paris. Last year, it distributed 21 million maps and helped to plan nearly a billion miles of travel. A driver can get free from any major oil company—or, if he is a member, from the A.A.A. or its affiliated clubs—a map tracing the shortest route but including information to help assure an enjoyable tour of the United States or Canada. South and Central America, Western Europe and many countries east of there. Most maps show at a glance road conditions, mileage between cities, points of interest, speed limits tolls, historical information and so on. Drivers who fear tunnels, bridges or winding mountain roads can learn about alternate routes before they start. One travel counselor in Esso's New York office has built up a file showing when flowers and trees in various states bloom. And drivers of trailer homes can find out how to bypass steep grades, prohibited parkways and tunnels. Apparently no route problem is beyond these specialists. One tourist planning a trip between New York and Quebec, asked for a route on which he would be no more than 50 miles away from a hospital at any time. His nine‐monthspregnant wife was going along. The route was provided, but the hospital wasn't needed.

970-> Syria Revolt Reported Growing; Bazaars in Damascus on Strike
DAMASCUS, Syria, April 19 —The bazaars of Damascus went on strike today to protest against socialism in Syria and to support the rebellion that broke out last Wednesday in the city of Hama. Hundreds of merchants, disgruntled over business restrictions and repeated declarations by the Baathist regime that Syria would become a democratic socialist state, put up the shutters on their shops. The capital was quiet and the entire business section was deserted. Tanks and the barbed wire that have ringed military headquarters here since last summer are still in position, but no troops were seen in strength and there were few signs of tension. Members of the rightist Moslem Brotherhood put pressure on small shopkeepers to protest the army's fight against the rebels in Hama, 130 miles to the north. Security forces there have been trying to end the insurrection led by the Moslem Brotherhood and what the Government called “reactionaries and feudalists” opposing land reform and socialist measures. The Baghdad radio, broadcasting from neighboring Iraq, where the Government opposes the Syrian regime, declared that strikes had been proclaimed in other cities and that Syrian planes had bombarded the city of Abu Kemal in northeastern Syria, near the Iraqi frontier. In ” Damascus there was no confirmation of the Baghdad statement and a Syrian Government statement said calm prevailed across the country. In the capital, however, people besieged grocery shops and bakeries to stock up. Other reports, denied by the Government, said merchants in the city of Horns had been on strike for four days over the fighting in Hama. Maj. Gen. Amin el‐Hafez, chairman of Syria's Revolutionary Council, warned earlier in Hama that the rebels would be crushed, that citizens would be disarmed and that buildings harboring snipers would be demolished after women and children were taken to safety. A statement by the Information Ministry denied that residential quarters in Hama had been shelled. It said almost all arms in Hame had been confiscated and most troublemakers arrested—eight while trying to flee to Iraq. Hama was sealed off under curfew. There were no confirmed reports whether fighting was continuing there. Earlier reports said that security forces had shelled mosques where Moslem Brother hood rebels had taken shelter and that the casualty toll was high, but a Government statement made no mention of mosques or continued fighting

971-> APPEAL BY SYRIA ON ISRAEL DENIED; Members of Arab League Adopt Moderate Approach
CAIRO, Jan. 18—Syrian demands that the Arab nations strike dramatically and soon against Israel over the Jordan River water issue received little support at the Arab League conference that closed yesterday. The moderate approach of most conferees was reflected in the mild closing communiqué. It urged practical measures to defeat Zionism and the “dangerous new aggression” represented by the river diversion, but it stressed the Arabs' desire for peace and peaceful means of attaining their objecives. Details of the resolution, calling for a vast Arab reclama‐tion project in the Jordan River valley and for an Arab joint military command, are being kept secret. Thus, in reality, the Arab kings and other heads of state ended their five‐day meeting without committing themselves to anything. There is no public timetable for building Arab dams or irrigation ditches, for organizing the joint command, and least of all for attacking Israel. It now seems unlikely that the Arabs as a whole have any specific move in preparation for the day Israel taps the Jordan's waters at the Sea of Galilee. This is expected to be in May or June. The demand for decisive action, military if necessary, was voiced at the first meeting last Monday night by Maj. Gen. Amin el‐Hafez, President of the Syrian revolutionary command. General Hafiz, strong man of the Baathist regime in Damascus, reasoned that now was the time for the Arabs to mass for a strike against Israel. His argument was that the Arabs could and would unite on the Jordan River issue because it was clearly an act of “aggression” against Arabs. If the Arabs do not stop Israel from watering the Negev, he contended, that region will soon be ready for settlement of at least two million Jewish immigrants, who will eventually make Israel harder to defeat. General Hafiz was answered at once by President Habid Bourguiba of Tunisia, and later by President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic, and King Hussein of Jordan. Their rebuttal was that the Arabs must develop strength and unity before starting a military attack against Israel, because Israel would surely get the support of Britain and the United States. The moderate view that prevailed is that the Arabs would be in a better world position if they allowed Israel to go ahead with the unilateral “usurpation” of waters the Arabs should share. The Arabs, instead of concentrating on attacking Israel, would proceed to develop reclamation plans forthe Jordan's headwaters. These could eventually reduce the Jordan's flow in Israel to 23 per cent of present volume. This is much less than Israel plans to take now. Then, if Israel attacked the Arabs, she and not the Arabs would be guilty of having struck the first blow. Meanwhile, the Arabs would have time to develop their joint military command, a development that might take a long time. General Hafez received no support at the conference, not even from President Abdel Salam Arif of Iraq, whose re‐gime has had Baathist party support. As a result General Hafez became an isolated figure. Syrian taunts first prompted President Nasser to request the Cairo meeting. Syrian Baathist newspapers charged that the United Arab republic would not fight Israel over the Jordan River diversion. Now all the Arab states, including Syria, are committed on the subject of fighting. Abdul Khalek Hassuna, Secretary General of the Arab League, said last night that $18 million was committed for “urgent operations” in the reclamation field.

974-> Talks May Be Renewed in Belgian Physicians' Strike
BRUSSELS, April 9—The first real break in the nineday strike of Belgian physicians came this morning when the Minister of the Interior, Arthur Gilson, met with a group of doctors to discuss emergency‐service plans. Mr. Gilson reported after the meeting, which covered the arrangements for the minimal force that is providing hospital treatment for urgent cases while most of Belgium's 10,000 doctors are on strike, that the doctors had demonstrated enough goodwill to warrant further contacts. Tonight, Premier Theo Lefevre and other Cabinet ministers held a preliminary meeting with a committee of doctors to consider resuming over the weekend the negotiations that were broken off nine days ago, a break‐ off that began the strike. The showdown had been building since the Parliament passed the new national health insurance law last year. The doctors characterized the bill as the first step toward fully socialized medicine. The attitude of the physicians contrasted to their position yesterday. Much of the change resulted from the release this morning of two doctors who had been under arrest since Monday, pending an investigation to determine if the death of an 18‐month‐old baby could have been caused by their negligence. Other signs of hope in the strike have appeared. A delegation of Christian Socialist leaders urged Premier Lefevre to spare no effort to bring about a resumption of the negotiations. Mr. Lefevre is the national leader of the Christian Socialists, Belgium's majority party. In Seraing, an industrial town near Liége, the local medical society reached a part agreement with city officials and trade unions officials. The three parties said tonight they hoped to complete their agreement tomorrow. This would mean the end of the strike in Seraing, assuming the agreement is endorsed by Government officials in Brussels. Opposition to a compromise settlement could come however from the Socialists, Belgium's second largest party. The Socialists, who control more than a third of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies, were instrumental in winning parliamentary support for the national health insurance law. There have been three crucial points in the dispute. The doctors have objected strongly to tighter and broader control over medical practice, which they say would be inevitable in the program. The physicians object to the financial provisions, which they contend have been deliberately designed to reduce their income. The doctors have objected on ethical grounds as well. They say the plan would compromise the confidential nature of the doctor‐patient relationship.

975-> Nassau Police Inspector Is Endorsed for Sheriff
GARDEN CITY, L. I., March 16 — Inspector Raymond L. Smith of Port Washington, commanding officer of the Nassau County Police Department's sixth precinct in Roslyn, was endorsed by the North Hempstead Town Republican Committee today as the Republican candidate for County Sheriff. The endorsement virtually assures Inspector Smith the nomination by the Republican County Executive Committee when it meets Thursday night to confirm the full slate of county candidates. Inspector Smith, 52 years old, will replace Sheriff Jesse P. Combs, the Republican incumbent, on the ticket. Sheriff Combs, who had been a prime target of the county Democratic administration, announced last week that he would not seek the nomination for a fourth term. The North Hempstead Republican Committee also endorsed Frank X. Altimari, a lawyer of Westbury, as its candidate for Third District Court Judge.

976-> Witness Tells of Galindez Pilot's Death
WASHINGTON, April 5—The young American pilot involved in the 1956 disappearance of Dr. Jesús Maria de Galindez was reported today to have been strangled in a Dominican prison and secretly buried. An account of the death of the pilot, Gerald Lester Murphy, and Dr. Galindez's purported assassination by henchmen of the late Dominican dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina was obtained last month in Sannto Domingo by former Representative Charles O. Porter of Oregon. The testimony was given by the former assistant warden of a Dominican prison to Mr. Porter in the presence of two United states Embassy officials. It shed new light on the Galindez‐Murphy case. It was Mr. Porter who first publicly linked Dr. Galindez's disappearance with the vanishing of Mr. Murphy, a 23‐yearold Oregonian, in a speech before the House of Representatives in February, 1957. Subsequent evidence uncovered by the Justice Department indicated that it was Mr. Murphy who flew Dr. Galindez from Zahn's Airport in Amityville, L. I., to the Dominican Republic on March 12, 1956. Dr. Galindez, a Basque scholar, was kidnapped that night in New York City by Trujillo agents. According to the testimony, Dr. Galindez was shot to death at Generalissimo Trujillo's rural estate of LaFundacion, wwhere he was taken for a confrontation with the dictator. The former assistant warden said he was not present at Dr. Galindez's murder but had obtained an account of it from someone who was. However, he said he was present at Mr. Murphy's murder. He gave the following account: There were two police officers and two corporals in the prison office with nim when a telephone call came from an army colonel ordering Mr. Murphy's killing. Mr. Murphy had been arrested about Dec. 1, 1956, when he had tried to obtain permission to leave the country. Mr. Murphy was then brought from his cell, and “one of the corporals hit him on the chin.” The pilot “crumpled to the ground” and the two. policemen then “placed a rope around his neck and each pulled it until Mr. Murphy was choked to death.” Mr. Murphy's body was then wrapped in a bag and taken to the Arroyo Salado Cemetery in the Dominican capital. The former official was said to be willing to repeat his testimony in a trial the present Dominican Government is considering holding on the Murphy murder. The two police officers and two corporals implicated by the testimony have been in prison since the overthrow of the Trujillo regime in 1961. Mr. Porter said he had a photostat of a page of the cemetery's ledger showing the section and the number of the grave where a body of an unidentified man was buried late at night on Dec. 2, 1956. The former lieutenant also told Mr. Porter that a Dominican nurse had flown with Dr. Galindez to the Dominican Republic and that she was subsequently slain. It was the nurse, Ana Gloria Vieira, the former official said, who told him that she had wit‐ nessed the slaying of Dr. Galindez. According to her story, the former official said, she was ordered to fly to New York and return with Dr. Galindez, acting as a nurse. After accompanying Dr. Galindez to La Fundacion, Miss Vieira was quoted as saying she witnessed the confrontation between the prisoner and Generalissimo Trujillo. In a fury, she said, the dictator told Dr. Galindez that “your life now is as worthless as an empty page in that book you were writing.” Mis Vieira said Dr. Galindez was then shot. She was subsequently imprisoned and in August, 1956, her battered body was found at the bottom of a ravine, off a highway some 30 miles from the Dominican capital. She was alone inside a wrecked and burned car, though her friends insisted she could not drive. The former prison official's testimony indicates that Mr. Murphy was strangled in the secret police prison after the Trujillo regime became suspicious that the pilot had offered to sell Dominican documents to Fulgencio Batista, then Cuban dictator who was then at odds with Generalissimo Trujillo. When the United States Government made inquiries about him in January, 1957, it was informed by the Dominicans that the young flier had been mnurdered by a fellow aviator who then committed suicide in jail.

977-> Hospital Is Accused of Mistreatment
The Department of Hospitals is investigating reports of mistreatment of patients at Bird S. Coler Memorial Hospital and Home on Welfare Island. In disclosing the inquiry, Dr. Ray E. Trussell, Hospital Com‐missioner, said: “I have been concerned about care at Bird S. Coler for some time.” The hospital is a 1,900-bed city chronic‐disease institution that deals almost exclusively with elderly people. It was learned that the re‐ports of mistreatment came from relatives of patients and from Miss Margaret Kelly, a supervisor of nurses at the hos‐pital, Miss Kelly, who has been at Coler for six years, said yester‐day “by my standards, the pa‐tients are very much neglected.” As an example, Miss Kelly said that in the geriatrics‐psy‐chiatric ward “Many patients are kept strapped in uncush‐ioned -wheel chairs from morn‐ing to -evening.” Miss Kelly also said that pa‐tients had complained to her about being slapped and pushed by attendants. On one occasion, she said, an attendant carried a 101-year‐old man who had refused to go to bed into a bed with bars on tha sides. When the attendant left, she said, the man at‐tempted to climb out of the bed, fell to the floor and died. “I’ve reported these and other conditions several times to my superiors, but nothing's been done. Something should be done for these poor, abandoned souls.” souls.” Expressing his concern, Dr. Trussell said it was fortunate that steps have just been taken to improve patient care at Coler. The Commissioner was refer‐ring to a recently announced affiliation contract, under which New York Medical College will take over the staffing of Coler Hospital.

978-> A Reader's Report
NOW that American Writers seem to have given it up, the British have cornered: the market on urbanity. You can’ t touch us for moral indignation, for the probing of unhappy adolescence, for the manufacture of regional fantasy. But for a sophisticated view of social flux, over a dozen Englishmen come to mind‐to which add the name of James Kennaway, who provides a delightfully askew view of the class struggle in  (Atheneum, $3.95). “I'd fixed myself,” says the author's heroine, “to live the rest of my life in direct conflict with what I believe.” StelIa Vass, the coiner of this statement, is a London City man's wife, seven years away from the university, but still addicted to the leather coat, black stockings and Harold Laski‐ism that were a part of her educational affiliation. What Mr. Kennaway does, in this elegant successor to “The Mind Benders,” is to explore—with wit and subtlety —the implications of Stella's crisis of values. The substance of the novel is a conventional enough triangle: Stelia finds her husband's boss, an upperclass manipulator named J. T. Sarson, more magnetic than her rosy‐cheeked Andrew. But her moral dilemma is compounded by a social one: is not having an affair with a financier of doubtful business ethics even more in the nature of “selling out” than being married to his underlin? If this is a bald statement of the novel's conflict, let me hasten to add that there is nothing didactic in the author's exploration of it. Mr. Kennaway has a remarkable knack for catching the amorphous, amoral tone of our times. He has an artist's talent for depicting the juxtaposition between states of mind and external appearances—and he threshes out his moral and social conundrums without creating stereotypes. Sarson the seducer is a moneybags whose agile mind is devoted not to moral principles but to problem solving. Stella is an intellectual —without being intelligent enough to understand the source of her own miseries. Andrew is a man of his times, warm, sensitive and flexible. The chemistry produced by these three is rewarding indeed. In William Wetmore's  (Doubleday, $5.50), a pious octopus of a financier moves one of his tentacles into the old Connecticut town of Gravenhurst. His intention is to raise the status of journalism there by killing off its daily newspaper through merger with a tabloid of his own creation. As the crisis in Mr. Wetmore's breezy and often entertaining novel deepens, there are revealed a surprising number of clay feet. Old Clarence Woodruff, the autocratic owner of The Gravenhurst Daily Watch, is human enough to go into a funk as the tabloid slices into his paper's circulation. Jesse Rosenfeldt, its publisher, finds that cost‐accounting isn't all in a small town where human orneriness can upset the best‐laid plans. The introduction of “a competitive newspaper climate” into Gravenhurst journalism has a surprisingly invigorating effect on its moral tone, though not in the platitudinous terms that the author's latter‐day Munsey had envisioned. Using Larry Woodruff, scion of The Daily Watch as his mouthpiece, Mr. Wetmore makes some sympathetic observations on smalltown life and on the excitement of putting out a small newspaper, where “the principal characters are the linotype machine, veins pumping molten lead ... and the rotary press, belly full of newsprint, soul full of thunder.” Richard Martin Stern, author of (Scribner's, $4.95), put in a stint of several years in the aircraft industry, which lends visible authenticity to this profile of an electronics boy wonder. Marvin Ross, the character about whom the novel revolves, is a 41‐year‐old whiz‐kid whose manufacturing plant is about to disintegrate while he lies under an oxygen tent, trying to survive a massive coronary. Mr. Stern depicts his hero's history in a series of flashbacks recalled by Bill Carson, a former associate, who had been the actual creator of the firm, but who had been squeezed out by Ross's compulsion to accept more and more responsibility. The novel's thesis, that Ross's “strength” is in reality based on weakness, on a fear of failure, is credible although inanimate. The wheeling and dealing necessary to run a converted bowling alley up into $50 million components factory is entirely convincing, as are the maneuvers Carson engineers to salvage the sinking firm. But the vitality needed to lift the book from a novel about business to a novel about people just isn't there. East meets West in Glendon Swarthout's  (Random House, $4.95), and the result is instant decadence. Professor Carleton Cadell comes out to Arizona from Connecticut in search of the rugged virtues; Eddie Bud Boyd, a cattle broker, hits town in order to spend his pile. The dude hoping to go native and the native trying to dude up both come different kinds of croppers in an avalanche of land developers, country clubbers, recalcitrant servants and all the other blights of what the author regards as a corrupted frontier. Mr. Swarthout's heart is clearly in his work, as he elegizes the ravaged West with references to such as Joseph Wood Krutch, George Meredith and H. Allen Smith. Indignation is not enough, however, in a comic novel in which the nonsense is not very well organized and the prototypes are as arid as their cactus‐covered homeland.

979-> ARCH SYMBOLIZES HOPE IN ST. LOUIS; New Landmark Is Going Up, as Is Area's Economy
ST. LOUIS — Resurgent in 1963, St. Louis entered its bicentennial year of 1964 with more than hope and prayers. The city has plans. Last year was one of preparation, good business, unparalleled construction and a beginning of projects that will change not only the face but also the image of St. Louis. Foremost among these, and the symbol of the new St. Louis, is the Gateway Arch on the Mississippi riverfront on the edge of the central business district. The stainless steel arch will reach a height of 630 feet, higherthan the Washington Monument, and will be the central feature of a national park symbolizing the role of St. Louis and the Mississippi as the gateway to the opening of the West. By the end of 1963, the arch's south leg had risen to 120 feet and the north leg to 170. St. Louis residents expect that when the arch is completed early in 1965 it will become a major tourist attraction. That possibility was the major factor in the start ofconstruction in 1963 of two downtown motor hotels and planning for a third, the first new downtown hotels in 30 years. It also had a bearing on the decision by a group of city business leaders to build a new 55,000‐seat sports arena near the arch as part of an $89 million redevelopment project involving 82 acres just off the central business district. This construction, begun in 1963, is expected to be completed in 1965. As an outgrowth of that project, a block‐long entertainment area has been planned. Walt Disney has been asked to develop it. The arch and the bicentennial aside, the judgment on 1963 and the promise of 1964 can be seen in these additional factors: Federal spending in Missouri totaled about $2 billion, the greatest ever, with the state ranking 10th in military contracts, second in National Aeronautics and Space Administration research and development contracts. Missouri's largest private employer, McDonnell Aircraft Corporation of St. Louis, had record sales, added a million square feet of floor space, increased employment by 11,700 from mid1961 and predicted another increase of 3,000 shortly. The firm's Gemini (two‐man spacecraft) contracts alone total $456,650,062. In 1963, the first residents moved into the 454‐acre $48,500,000 Mill Creek Valley urban renewal area, said to be the largest of its kind in the United States. The construction of warehouses, industrial units, highways and a new St. Louis University campus in the area got under way. Much construction was completed. Major companies reported record years and predicted increases in 1964. Among them were Pet Milk Company, Emerson Electric Company, Brown Shoe Company, Laclede Gas Company and Aetna Finance Company. Many corporations talked of expansion plans. The General American Life Insurance Company reported selling 83 per cent more life insurance in 1963 over 1962. Monsanto Chemical Company reported a large volume year with improved earnings. The St. Louis County Water Company pumped a record number of gallons for a year. The brewing industry, one of the city's strongest, had outstanding, in some cases record. years. Some businessmen cautioned against overoptimism. But St. Louisans, for the most part, had their eyes on the Gateway Arch. And it was going up.

980-> HOUSE COMMITTEE VOTES ALL OF AID; Panel Leaves Authorization
WASHINGTON, May 27—President Johnson's request for a $3,516,700,000 foreign aid authorization was formally approved today by the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It was the first time in the 17-year history of the legislation that the group refused to cut the amount. The vote was 22 to 7. As ordered reported to the House, the measure empowered the Federal Government for the first time to guarantee private credit sales of military equipment and services to any country as long as the President found such assistance would strengthen American security and promote world peace. Such sales of military equipment would be entirely outside the military aid program, for which the committee approved a total of $1,055,000,000. The Administration estimated that these sales would reach $262 million in the current fiscal year, and could reach $400 million through the Federal guarantee provision in the fiscal year beginning July 1. In a report on the bill scheduled to be submitted to the House tomorrow, the committee said: “There are a number of countries able and willing to purchase military equipment in this manner where the political situation is such that commercial lenders are reluctant to extend credit at going rates. The purpose of the new authority is to provide a sales guarantee similar to the investment guarantee program.” The authorization figure approved by the committee included $2,461,700,000 in various forms of economic loans and giants and $1,055,000,000 for military aid, such as planes, tanks and guns and maintenance of present equipment It included the full $125 million asked by the President as additional aid to South Vietnam. This embraced $55 million in military hardware and $70 million in so‐called supporting assistance, a form of budgetary support to shore up the economy of countries with larger defense establishments than they can finance without outside help. In its report on the authorizing legislation, which sets ceilings of items for which money must be provided in a separate appropriation bill later, the committee said: “The fact that the President has requested approximately $1 billion less for foreign aid than was requested for fiscal 1964 does not indicate that providing assistance to other nations is any less essential to the implementation of our foreign policy or to the maintenance of our security than in previous years.” Much of the committee report was devoted to answering arguments for cutting the Administration's request. It condemned as “specious philosophy” contentions that the foreign aid agency usually approached the end of a fiscal year with “tremendous unobligated” amounts on hand. This argument was based, the majority said, on the unfounded premise that “money appropriated must be spent.” It added: “The committee does not endorse this imprudent approach to the handling of public funds. If a particular program does not materialize as planned, it is a mark of sound management to withhold the obligation of funds.” While it did not condone “those instances where foreign aid funds have not been used most productively,” the com mittee observed that “this is a global program that must operate in areas where sound fiscal practices are not well established.” At the same time, the committee said it “noted with concern, the large proportion of development loan funds devoted to so - called program loans and used primarily for commodity imports having no relation to specific projects such as highway, hydro‐electric, school, housing or to well‐defined health and sanitation projects” “In general,” the majority said, “the committee recognizes that whenever the administrators of the aid program are convinced that the financing of commodity imports is essential, it is better to finance such imports with loans rather than grants.” Figures made available by the Agency for International Development showed that de velopment loans authorized in the fiscal year ending last June had totaled $1,248,795 000. The report for the majority also sought to answer those who argue each year that aid should be cut because, in addition to the unobligated funds left over, the program entailed “large unexpended balances” of obligated funds at the end of the fiscal year. “This interpretation of these balances (popularly called the pipeline) ignores the fact that they represent funds already obligated for goods and services that have not yet been delivered. When delivery is made, payments must be met. The greater emphasis on loans rather than grants tends to build up the pipeline, Representative Thomas E. Morgan, Democrat of Pennsylvania, chairman of the committee, said he would ask for Rules Committee action on the bill next week in the hope of bringing the measure to the floor in the week of June 8.

981-> CHANGES IN MASS ARE MADE PUBLIC; English to Replace Latin in the Epistle and Gospel
WASHINGTON, May 21 (AP) —Details of the shift from Latin to English in many parts of the Roman Catholic mass for Americans were made public today. But the National Catholic Welfare Conference noted that the change could not go into effect until new liturgical books were published and distributed. It had been indicated earlier that this might not be accom‑ plished before the start of the church year, Advent Sunday, which falls on Nov. 29 this year The United States Conference of Bishops will set the exact date later. The welfare conference said that missals for altar use were being speeded to press but hand missals in English for use by the congregation would not be published for some‐time. This is because other changes are expected. The Vatican's new Liturgical Commission is engaged in extensive revision of mass texts and rites and this is expected to take years. Bishops from nine English‐speaking countries are preparing a common text for use throughout those nations. Meanwhile, English texts for the mass will be made available to the people on cards, leaflets, and missal inserts. The Vatican council of the world's Bishops adopted last Nov. 22 a constitution permit‑ ting the mass and other serv‑ ices to use the local language instead of Latin. This was promulgated by Pope Paul VI Dec. 4. The United States Bishops, meeting April 2, adopted proposed chanages for American Catholics. These were approved May 1 by the Vatican commission for implementing the Pope's decree. The United States changes include both sung and recited masses as well as other liturgical services. English will replace Latin for the lessons of the mass—the Epistle and Gospel and other readings that sometimes precede the Epistle. They are to be proclaimed with the priest fac ing the people instead of the altar. The United States Bishops de‑ cided, too, that English would be used in other parts of the mass such as the Kyrie, the Gloria, the Creed, the Sanctus, the Lord's Prayer, the Agnus Dei, the Ecce Agnus Dei and the triple “Non Sum Dignus” before communion. Also in English will be the invocations by the faithful after the Gospel and sermon; the introit, gradual, offertory and communion anthem and various salutations and dialogue such as: “The Lord be with you. And with your spirit.” Latin will be retained for opening prayers at the foot of the altar and the collect, the preface and the rest of the canon of the mass, except the Sanctus‐Benedictus. English will also be used for all sacrament and sacramental rites, except Holy Orders—the ordaining of priests. The detailed list of changes includes elimination of the archaic “thou” and “thee.” They will be replaced by “you.” The new decree will allow the local Bishop to permit vernacular languages other than English when he decides “the true and certain necessity of the church requires.” For instance Spanish‐speaking communities in this country could have the liturgy in their own tongue.

984-> INCENTIVE PLANS TESTED IN SOVIET; Scholar Tells of Attempt to Increase Productivity
The Soviet Government, according to Prof. Alec Nove of Glasgow University, has introduced a profit‐incentive system in 80 industrial enterprises to determine if it can increase production. Professor Nove made the disclosure at yesterday's panel discussion on “Sources of Postwar Soviet Economic Growth” at the first national meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies. The profit‐incentive system introduced in the Soviet enterprises, Professor Nove said, is a modified form of the plan originally proposed by Prof. Yevsey G. Liberman of Kharkov. Professor Liberman's plan generated heated discussions in the Soviet Union and was reported to have attracted the sympathetic attention of Premier Khrushchev, who was combatting a falling rate of national economic growth. Professor Liberman urged that factory bonuses be tied to profit and recommmended that management be given considerable latitude in use of its share of profits for the modernization of plants and extra payments to workers. An important role would presumably be assigned to worker advisory committees. The role of the worker committees under the Liberman plan bears some resemblance to that of the worker councils in the Yugoslav industrial system. That system is also characterized by a profit‐incentive system under which management can invest its bonuses in plant improvement, housing, education and social welfare. Two Soviet economists, V. Belkin and I. Birman, writing in Izvestia in November, 1962, related the price‐inventive system to the need for a new method of computing wholesale prices. They supported a recommendation of Prof. Aksel I. Berg in Pravda that computers be used to devise a new price system based on actual costs. The panelists generally agreed that there had been a decline in the Soviet economic growth rate but they seemed chary of endorsing the widely publicized Central Intelligence Agency report that the annual rate had fallen to about 2.5 percent. One panel participant ridiculed the public methods employed by the intelligence agency. In discussing the possible reasons for the decline of the Soviet growth rate, the discussants advanced several hypotheses. Prof. Robert W. Campbell of Indiana University suggested that the Soviet political and administrative structures were perhaps not able to cope with the new environment that the great postwar industrial and economic advances had brought into being. Professor Campbell said there were hints that the Soviet system, characterized by its ability to mobilize manpower and material resources, could not cope with its economic system. Professor Campbell suggested that if the Soviet Government was to deal effectively with the problem it must find a way of releasing the initiative of its people and permitting them to make spot decisions because the central administrative apparatus was too cumbersome to do so. Professor Nove agreed that the inadequacy of the organizational structure had contributed to the falling growth rate and that major organizational changes were in order. He also agreed that a deceleration of investment had played a part in the declining growth rate. Professor Nove said that there was discussion in the Soviet Union of the need for decentralizing management control. The discussions also concern profit incentives, he said. A panelist urged his colleagues to resist the temptation of drawing unduly negative conclusions from the declining growth rate because the Soviet Union had great “hidden” manpower and material reserves that had not been brought into play in the economic development programs.

The 27‐year‐old flier took one hour and 17 minutes to negotiate the 8,000‐foot Owen Stanley Ranges from Port Moresby. She will take off tomorrow on the 1,500‐mile stretch to Guam that she regards as the most dangerous part of her 27,000‐mile trip. It was between Lae and Guam that Amelia Earhart disappeared during her round‐the‐world flight in 1937 Miss Merriam, of Long Beach, Calif., is attempting to complete Miss Earhart's route. She left Oakland, Calif., in her twinengine plane last March 17 and hopes to return there by next weekend.

988-> Victory Claimed by Saigon
SAIGON, South Vietnam, March 3 — South Vietnams' army took the occasion of a North Vietnamese Communist holiday today to claim a heavy casualty toll against the Vietcong in a three‐hour battle near the Cambodian frontier. The army's contention that 110 Vietcong had been killed in the action was, however, disputedputed by other sources, including witnesses. One United States Army officer advising the Vietnamese paratroopers in the engagement was killed, a United States military spokesman reported. Thirteen South Vietnamese troops were also reported killed and 85 wounded in the battle at Thuong Phuoc, 100 miles west of Saigon. Reliable military sources reported that another United states officer was kilid today, in a clash with the Communists near Trung Lap village, 27 miles northtvest of Saigon. [United Press International said the deaths today brought to 190 the number of Americans killed in South Vietnam, 110 of them in combat.] The Government of Premiere Nguyen Khanh is eager to claim a military victory now that a month has elapsed since the overthrow of the previous military junta. The forthcoming visit of Secretary McNamara is also a factor. But the results of today's engagement did not live up to extravagant early reports. The large Vietcong casualty figure was based on a Vietnamese Army report of a count of bodies. Later reports from qualified military sources, however, said there had been no body count and the Vietcong losses were estimated at no more than 35. A United States spokesman also announced today that a United States Navy officer was killed in a helicopter crash Monday at Cao Lanh, 75 miles southwest of Saigon. [The Associated Press reported in Washington that the Navy had identified the man as Lieut. Cmdr. Paul A. Wildauer of Reynoldsville, Pa.]

989-> Knicks Rout 76ers, 142‐118, to Snap Philadelphia's 5‐Game Winning Streak; NEW YORK AHEAD THROUGHOUT GAME; Boozer's 26 Points Pace Victory—Lakers Beat Celtics by 97‐95
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 5 (UPI)—The New York Knicks smashed Philadelphia's fivegame winning streak today by scoring a 142‐118 National Basketball Association victory. The 76ers stayed with New York only for six minutes of the first period. The Knicks then went ahead to stay on a basket by Art Heyman with 5:49 remaining and never trailed again. New York built its margin to 38‐30 at the quarter and held a 75‐60 bulge at the half. The Knicks entered the last quarter with a 26‐point lead and were never threatened. Bob Boozer led the Knick scorers with 26 points and Len Chappel made 21. Len Morley was high for Philadelphia with 21. Larry Costello had 16. Philadelphia played most of the game without Hal Greer, its leading scorer. Greer suffered a contusion of his back in a fall last night at Baltimore. Greer started but left after 4 minutes 40 seconds in which he failed to score. Johnny Egan of the Knicks was unable to play because of a knee injury.  G. F. P.  G. F. P.

991-> I.B.M. FAIR SHOW PEEKS INSIDE MIND; Viewers in Dark Explore How a Woman Thinks
A wall of 200 people rose steeply and slowly and then disappeared in a 90‐foot high dome that looks like a bowl of jelled alphabet soup. There are only three letters in the alphabet—IBM—but they are embossed on the dome's exterior 1,000 times, and they spelled a world of excitement for yesterday's preview visitors to this World's Fair pavilion. The wall—called a People Wall — stands on a 45‐degree angle and has 12 rows of seats that can accommodate about 500 people on each trip. Weighing 60,000 pounds, the wall is lifted hydraulically and travels 53 feet up into an ovoid‐shaped theater. The wall then becomes the gallery. After 57 seconds of traveltime, yesterday's guests found themselves sitting under a darkened dome. A great trap door closed behind them, sealing them in darkness. Suddenly the darkness was broken by light and sound, and the interior came alive with synchronized projections of moving and still pictures on 16 screens. The viewers' eyes flash frantically from side to side and up and down. And because of the steepness of the seats and the resulting absence of heads in front of him, the viewer feels he is all alone. He finds himself in the middle of an auto race, in a wind tunnel, out in the country and even inside the mind of a won‐ an, planning a party guest list. The idea of the information machine, as the show is called, is to present ar entertaining explanation of how computers employ simple, everyday methods to solve complicated problems. In the case of the woman planning a party, the viewer sees her on one screen, her pencil drawing a seating plan on another screen, the people actually popping into place at the table on another, and closeups of people being considered for invitations all around the theater. “That's just how I think things out,” one woman in the audience confided to a friend. The auto race takes the viewer into the grandstand, into the cockpit of the car, under the eft front wheel, inside the engine, under the clocker's pencil —and all at the same time. The show, which is free, runs 1.2 minutes and, when the fair opens a week from tomorrow, will be shown every 15 minutes.

992-> SPEAKING OF BOOKS
JUDGING from the correspondence provoked by the column for Feb. 23, the collect ing of collective nouns is a widely popular hobby. Sundry lists of them have been a large part of my mail in recent weeks. In addition to these I have received various versions of the tale that turns on how best to describe a group of ladies of pleasure. Sometimes it is a quartet of Oxford dons who appIy their wits to the problem, sometimes a foursome of tweed-coated Englishwomen, but whoever the four are, they usually come up with the same suggestions: a jam of tarts, a flourish of strumpets, an essay of trollops, and an anthology of pros. Sometimes it is a blare of strumpets and one maverick has put in a plea for a Cockney candidate: a smelting of ’ores. Just now an old Elizabethan gallant has raised his voice and proposed a trifle of trulls. Suppose we lay the matter to rest. I have been reproved, justifiably, on three counts, for having written that “fish, unlike animals and birds, have been confined to one collective noun = sch.00ls.” I grudgingly admit that strictly speaking both fish and birds are animals, although we do not ordinarily think of them as such, and I am indebted to Mr. Martin Gross for reminding me that the following terms exist in application to fish: an army of herrings, a pack of perch, a troop of dogfish, a smack of jellyfish and a hover of trout. And in connection with my complaint that the sea gull has been denied a group designation of his own, Mr. Gross informs me that Nuttall's Dictionary assigns him the term “colony.” I can only protest that it is not a generally accepted term, and that I prefer my own suggestion, “congregation.” From Mrs. Morris Ernst, who has perceptively written about words, comes the apt proposal that a gathering of gnlls be described as a “Parlement of Fowles.” I call it apt because, erroneously or not, gulls sitting together in large companies, as they so often do, give the impression of collective deliberation. I am in trouble, toö, over my rejection of the word “gang” as ‐ applied to elk and buffalo in modern times. Mr. Richard Dillon, who is writing a biögraphy of Meriwether Lewis, leader of the Lewis and Clark expedition, tells me that in his journal, which I have read *only in part, Lewis used the word in connection with both animals. And Mr. Russell Thomas writes me that Lewis also spoke • of “a Drove of Buffalow.” INCIDENTALLY, Mr. Thomas asks me if I could not stimulate some paperback publisher to revive “Words and Their Ways in English Speech” by two great Harvard scholars, James Bradstreet Greenough and George Lyman Kittredge. The effort is not necessary, for that excellent book, first published more than 60 years ago, was reissued as a paperback ($1.95) by the Beacon Press of Boston in 1962, after having been out of print for many years. • Greenough and Kittredge did not concern themselves with this rather trifling matter of collective nouns, but they wrote one of the most interesting books about words and their ways that has ever been published. For all their learning, which they carry lightly, Greenough and Kittredge did not write about words in isolation, but always viewed them against the background of the human society in which they were born, developed, changed or died. A mere listing of some of the chapter headings conveys some idea of the book's range. I dispense with quotation marks: The Origin of Language, Learn ed Words and Popular Words, Slang and Legitimate Speech, The Literary Language, Fashion in Language, The Development of Words, Fossils, Degeneration of Meaning, Words From the Names of Animals, and so on. Two of the most fascinating chapters are those concerned with the distinctions between learned and popular words, and the manner in which many learned words become popular — that is, in the sense of becoming the property of the average person. When Greenough and Kittredge speak of learned words, they do not mean merely those that are used by scholars alone, but all words acquired through books and the cultivation of literature rather than through the actual needs of ordinary conversation. I like their insistence on the fact that every educated person has at least two ways of speaking his mother tongue: the first that which he in his family, among his friends and on ordinary occasions; the second the language he employs in discussing more complicated subjects, and in speaking to people with whom he is less intimately acquainted. When you stop to think of it, it is extraordinary that a learned word has in the course of time often actually displaced the popular word of identical meaning. This is true, for example, of contradict, which we now learn to use from childhood, yet it took its place iii the language much later than two exact and once popular synonyms which have fallen by the wayside=withsay, which is now obsolete, and which has become learned. By some incredible typographical alchemy, last Sunday's column was made to speak of the force of John Crowe Ransom's “indulgence.” Actually, the word was “influence.”

997-> HALL LEADS TRIALS FOR U.S. ROAD RACE
AUGUSTA, Ga.Feb. 29 (UPI)—Fourteen cars, led by Jim Hall's Chevrolet‐powered Chapparal, bettered the Augusta International Speedway record;today in qualifyingfor the first United Statesroad racing and manufacturer's championship race tomorrow. Hall's best lap, giving him the pole position for the race for points toward the United States driver's championship, was 1 minute 472 seconds, an average of 100.7 miles an hour over the three‐mile Course. The previous best lap here was turned inby Fireball Roberts at 93 miles an hour in winning last year's Augusta 510mile race for stock cars. Hall, who builds the Chapparal, was closely followed by the powerful Ford‐powered King Cobras of Carroll Shelby. Dave McDonald's Cobra turned the course a second slower than Hall, and the defending road racing champion, Bob Holbert, was seven‐tenths of a second slower than his teammate. Buck Fulp, driving for the Ferrari‐sponsored North American Racing Team, turned the course in 1:52. Fulp,. of Anderson, S. C., was driving the prototype Ferrari 250 L.M. Grand Touring car in itsfirst rae. Harry Heuer was behind Fulp in a Meister Brauser Chapparal at 1;54. The qualifying racing for the manufacturer's event, for production cars only, was dominated as expected, by Shelby's A.C. Cobras. The team manager, Ken Miles, turned the fastest lap for the A.C. Cobras, equaling Huerer at 1:54. McDonald was a second slower in the other team Cobra. There was a wide gap between McDonald and Graham Shaw's A.C. Cobra in third at 2:03.

999-> HARDY CAMELLIAS; Sasanqua Group Thrives In the Northeast
GARDENERS searching for beautiful fall blossoms plus glossy evergreen foliage should try the Camellia sasanqua group. The hardy ahrubs tolerate a wide variety ot soils, bloom profusely when small and many newer varieties are proving winter resistant. Growth habits vary from upright and compact to open and graceful. Many are suitable for espalier, as specimens, in foundation plantings and, when protected, screens and hedges. Jean May, a sasanqus variety bearing exquisite large shell pink, semi‐double ts double blooms from late swmmer into fall is one of the best in the hardy group. The shrub is noted for its quality and quantity of bloom end its attractive upright habit. During the winter of 1962–63 a bed of Jean May sasanquas growing in an open nursery field withstood oocasionai zero temperatures and weeks of cold weather. The only damage was slight browning of foliage; leaves did not drop. After such a rigorous test,I did not expect the usual production of blossoms. The plants bloomed profusely, however, and continued until late November despite sununer and fall droughts. Dependable Varieties Some other reliably hardy sesanquas are: Cleopatra, rose‐pink semi‐double to peony‐type blooms fastand compact grower, exceptionally hardy; Dawn, hardy with single to semi‐double soms of ivory white with blush pink at petal margins, upright and compact, withstands cold weather; Rosea, older popular variety with large single pink flowers; Shishi Gashira, heavy double blooms with bright rose‐red flowers, slow growing, low and compact, quite hardy. To grow camellias successfully, certain culture rules must be followed. Both the Japonica and sasanqua camellias like acid soil. Neither type tolerates alkalinity. (Never apply compost to which lime has been added around camellias.) All camellies need some protection in very cold clinriates They will grow in full sun but should be placed near a wall, underhigh shade of pine trees or on the north side of the house. An organic soil of equal parts peat moss, loamy top soil and sand should be used. Extra good drainage is essential. The top of the root ball should be slightly above the ground line and covered with a half inch of soil (whether planted in the ground or in a tub). Mulch the plants with pine needles, rotted oak leaves or peat moss. Because they are shallowly planted, water when necessary and especially during dry spells.

1000-> Marchi Predicts Passage
State Senator John J. Marchi said yesterday that he was “very optimistic” that the Legislature would pass a “substantial liquor reform program” that would meet the approval of all parties. Mr. Marchi, who is chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee for the Study of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, refused to elaborate, but he did indicate that the program would encompass “some middle ground” between Rockefeller's proposed liquor law revisions and the recommendations of the joint committee. The Staten Island Republican made his remarks after addressing a luncheon meeting of the Women's City Club of New York at 6 West 48th Street. He forecast that the compromise program would be “something that the Legislature will be able to support and that the Governor will welcome.” Two of the alternate proposals advanced by Mr. Marchi's committee have been passed by the Senate.

1001-> Hospital Officials to Be Honored
The Bay Ridge Community Council will honor two men on June 10 for their efforts in increasing hospital facilities in Brooklyn. The council will present bronze plaques to the men, George A. Aliano, president of Victory Memorial Hospital, and Thomas C. Ekeland, president of Lutheran Medical Center, at a dinner at the Elegante, 1060 Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn. The New York Hospital Association, in a survey several years ago, found that the Bay Ridge area needed hospital beds. Since then Victory hospital and the Lutheran center, under the leadership of Mr. Aliano and Mr. Ekeland, have built new wings to meet this need. Mr. Aliano headed a campaign that resulted in a new wing with 64 additional beds being built at Victory hospital. Mr. Ekeland was in charge of raising funds to build a wing with 87 new beds and to modernize the Lutheran center at a cost of more than $4 million. Mr. Aliano has been a trustee of Victory hospital for 20 years and president for 14 years. Mr. Ekeland has been a trustee of the Lutheran center since 1953 and was elected president a year ago.

1002-> Edward Zeltner, 56, Columnist For Hearst Papers Here, Dies; Wrote Daily ‘Over the River’ Feature on Brooklyn and Queens for The Mirror
Edward Zeltner, long a Hearst newspaper columnist here, died yesterday at Physicians Hospital, Jackson Heights, Queens, a few days after undergoing kidney surgery. He was 56 years old. Mr. Zeltner, who lived at 611 Wildwood Road, West Hempstead, L. I., wrote in his column about community affairs in Brooklyn, Queens and elsewhere on Long Island. He called it “Over the River.” It began in 1938 in The New York Mirror and, except when Mr. Zeltner was an Army sergeant in World War II, continued daily except Saturdays until The Mirror ceased publication last Oct. 16. Since then it had appeared on Sundays in The New York Journal‐American Mr. Zeltner wrote his last column a few days ago on a portable typewriter in the hospital. A tall, lively man who retained his early enthusiasm for newspaper work to the end, “as if he had been a cub reporter,” according to a colleague yesterday, Mr. Zeitner was a son of a newspaperman and former Alderman, the late Louis (Wireless Louis) Zeltner, so called because of the speed with which he gathered news and got it into print. Edward Zeltner was born on the Lower East Side. In the early nineteen‐twenties he became a copy boy and later sports reporter for The Mirror. Then came his column. At his death he had been, for about six months, writing a column, “Over the Airways,” for Aviation News, a trade paper. Mr. Zeltner was the founder and a former president of the Knights Before Christmas, a Brooklyn organization that gives Christmas parties and summer outings for poor and orphaned children. He was active in charitable fund‐raising campaigns. He was instrumental in having Shea Stadium in Flushing, Queens, the home of the New York Mets baseball club, named for William A. Shea, who had helped to bring the National League back to New York. Zeltner was a member of the Overseas Press Club of America, the Newspaper Reporters Association of New York City, the Newspaper Guild of New York, the Aviation Space Writers Association and the Pitt Street Boys Association. His marriage to Miss Leona Ehrman ended in divorce. Surviving are his widow, Mrs. Lillian Kazan Zeltner; a son, David E. Zeltner; six sisters, Mrs. Sadie Blatt, Mrs. Julia Sigelstein, Mrs. Frances Hammer, Dr. Edna Mortimer, Mrs. Hortense Paster and Mrs. Martha Chesnoff, and three brothers, Irwin, Paul and Harold Zeltner. A funeral service will be held at 11:30 A.M. tomorrow at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, 1 Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn.

1005-> CHALLENGE FACED BY PSYHIATRISTS; They Find Kennedy's Mental Health Plan Is Big Task
LOS ANGELES, May 3—As the American Psychiatric Association gathered here to open its 120th annual meeting tomorrow, it was generally conceded that its most challenging task was mobilizing to put President Kennedy's mental health program into operation. Mr. Kennedy's program of community health services reflects the growing trend of American psychiatry, which is moving closer to the people and the community it must understand and treat. Leading psychiatrists hold to the view expressed by Dr. Jack R. Ewalt, the association's president, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard University. “The patient's needs come first, before the doctor or the Institution,” he said. From experimentalist to practitioner to administrator, the theme of participation in the community mainstream is being stressed here. The aim, Dr. Ewait said, is to treat the patient “where, when and only as much as he needs treating.” It is away from long‐term and indiscriminate hospital confinement and isolation and even, many psychoanalytically trained therapists say, away from long periods on the psychoanalytic couch. Psychiatry is reaching for solutions to intercommunity problems such as the civil rights struggle. Most psychiatrists questioned here found in the Negro struggle a sign of national maturity arid mental health, dispite disorders and the threat of violence. “One hundred years ago civil rights was a bloody battle,” Dr. Ewalt said. “This is better. It is healthier to have some knocked heads and parades than a civil war.” On the whole, he and other colleagues find the present movement a sign of more, rather than less, sanity in the country. A knowledge of emotions and the need for their outlet may have helped bring about this sanity, they believe. “People have learned that it is not good to live with terrible frustrations, that the normal expression of them — the acting out, we call it — is right,” Dr. Ewalt said. “As bad as it is sometimes, it is good.” Dr. Ewalt headed the Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Health that made a report on which President Kennedy based his mental health program. He believes that the shift in psychiatry to the people is its own manifestation of mental health. Psychiatrists are no longer taking just the patients who interest them or fit into a research project, he said. He said that they should take more “character or personality disorder people who do not fit into a classifiable mentally ill category.” This group is perhaps epitomized in the assassination of Mr. Kennedy, he said, urging that psychiatrists interest themselves in the potential danger and treatment of such persons. This week psychiatrists will discuss refinements of drug therapy that have helped reduce population of mental hospitals by more than 100,000 since their application less than a decade ago.

1009-> HOUSE UNIT VOTES DEBT‐CEILING RISE; Excise Taxes Also Retained Over G.O.P. Objections
WASHINGTON, May 26 —Bills, to raise the national‐debt limit to $324 billion from $315 billion and to continue $1.9 bil‐lion of excise taxes for another year were approved today by the House Ways and Means Committee. Both measures were cleared by voice vote in the form recommended by the Johnson Administration. Republicans failed, 14 to 11, to win approval of a $530 million reduction in excise or sales taxes on jewelry, furs, toilet preparations and luggage. The Republicans also opposed the projected new debt limit, an increase of $9 billion, as too high, but made no effort to change the figure. The House is expected to pass the bills early in June and send them to the Senate for completion of Congressional action before the end of the month. The present debt limit of $315 billion will automatically revert to $309 billion on June 29 and to $285 billion on June 30 unless Congress acts in the meantime. June 30 is alse the expiration date for the $1.9 billion in excise taxes on liquor, beer, wine, tobacco, automobiles, telephone service and air travel. Both bills consequently must be enacted before then to prevent disruption of the Government's fiscal affairs. Without legislation on the debt limit, the Government would be unable to borrow money to pay its bills. Failure to extend the excise taxes would increase the prospective deficit of $5.8 billion in the 1965 fiscal year, which starts July 1, to $7.7 billion. Senate leaders hope to dispose of the civil rights bill, now on the floor, in time to act on the debt and tax measures before the end of the month. If they are successful, the rights bill aside probably have to be laid aside temporarily. The national debt subject to the statutory limit stands at $308.7 billion and is expected to rise to $311.8 billion by the nd of June. The $324 billion limit provided by the pending bill would cover the $5.8 billion budget deficit expected in the 1965 fiscal year and would also allow for seasonal fluctuations in tax collections. Largely because of these fluctuations, the national debt will rise to about $324 billion in mid‐March and then gradually decline to about $318 by the end of the fiscal year, according to Treasury estimates. Most of the excise taxes that would be extended under the other bill were imposed in 1951 to help finance the Korean War. The wartime rates were to have expired in 1953, but have been continued since then on a year‐to‐year basis. The bill postpones for another year these reductions: distilled spirits, from $10.50 a gallon to $9; beer, from. $9 a barrel to $8; wines, from various rates based on alcohol content to levels about 11 per cent lower; cigarettes, from 8 cents a pack to 7 cents; passenger cars, from 10 per cent of the manufacturer's price to 7 per cent, and automotive parts and accessories, from S per cent of the manufacturer's price to 5 per cent. The bill also continues present rates on general telephone service at 10 per cent and air passenger fares at 5 per cent. Those taxes would be automatically repealed June 30 in the absence of legislation extending them; The taxes unsuccessfully attacked by Republican committee men today are not affected by the bill, since no termination date is provided by present law. The rate on all of the items involved is 10 per cent of the retail price. The Ways and Means Committee has scheduled a comprehensive study of all excise taxes, starting in mid‐June, with the idea of possible reductions in 1965 or 1966. These plans were cited by Democratic managers of the extension bill in arguing against piecemeal cuts such as the Republicans proposed.

1011-> SPACE FUNDS STIR POLITICAL STORM; Midwest Complains of Lost Contracts—Studies Show Coasts Get Lion's Share
WASHINGTON, Feb. 29 —Space dollars from the Federal Treasury are falling in uneven showers in parts of the country that already are receiving a big share of defense research dollars. Most of the space funds, now being spent at the rate of $10 million a day, are bypassing the Middle West. Some of the money is going to the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf Coast, but most of it is reaching the already booming missile and electronic industries of the Pacific Coast. Fifty per cent of the contract dollars awarded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, for example, is going to California. Almost all of the rest is divided among only nine other states. Moreover, the biggest space contractors often are also the biggest defense contractors. Scientific policy makers within the Administration as well as politicians from the bypassed regions are becoming concerned over this increasing regional and industrial concentration of the Government's two largest research and development programs. Significantly, the regional concentration was one of the principal problems pinpointed for study by the. Select House Committee on Research which was set up last year to take the first comprehensive Congressional look at the Government's expanding involvement in research and development. In its first progress report, issued earlier this month, the committee observed that “there is a growing feeling of concern that more than a generous share” of the researchand development funds is “concentrated in a handful of states.” “It is clear that our national security must not be impaired by regional consideration in research and development expenditures,” it said. “It is equally clear that, to an extent perhaps not yet accurately measureable, these same expenditures have an extraordinarily powerful impact on the educational, industrial and employment sectors of every region's vitality.” In polite terms the committee report was reflecting the increasingly vocal complaints from politicians who believe that their states are not getting a fair share of the research and development dollars. While the regional desires are quickening, there are signs there will be relatively fewer research and development dollars to be distributed. A report by the House Space Subcommittee on Science, Research and Development pointed out today, for example, that there were indications of a leveling off in Government expenditures for research and development. Since World War II, these expenditures have been increasing at a rate of 19.8 per cent a year. For the Administration, this developing regional concentration and rivalry presents a difficult political dilemma of how to balance the specific objectives of research and development with its more intangible socio‐economic benefits. Partly because of the political complaints, but more out of a concern for the economic and educational growth of the nation as a whole, the Administration about a year ago began facing up to this dilemma. But its first tentative steps have not met with much political success. A year ago the Administration proposed to Congress a civilian technology program that was frankly predicated on the premise that the space and defense programs were creating an inbalance by draining away re‐ sources and manpower from the civilian economy. The proposal was to set up universities that would work on the technological and economic problems of a region in the same manner that the agricultural extension service has worked with land grand colleges on state and regional farm problems. The civilian technology program died aborning, largely because of the opposition from certain segments of industry that was reflected in the House Appropriatins Committee. Another, more indirect approach proposed by the Administration was to use National Science Foundation money to build up new, outstanding technological with the hope they could provide the stimulus for the technological growth of a region. Through a combination of poor salesmanship by the Administration, lack of support from the present leading universities and Congressional economizing, the “centers of excellence” program nearly foundered last year. On its own, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is attempting to broaden the economic and industrial impact of its rapidly expanding program through a somewhat similar approach. Working through u agency is atteming to enlist new regions in its program and to apply the technocological developments of its research to the civilian economy. The space contracts have tended to accentuate the existing research concentration on the East and West coasts. The high degree of concentration is illustrated by the fact that 90 per cent of the space contracts and 83 per cent of the defense research contracts are going to only 10 states. The states receiving the lion's, share of the space contracts correspond closely to those receiving the bulk of the Pentagon's reserach and development contracts as is illustrated by the following tables. PRIME SPACE CONTRACTS State Per Cent California ..... 50 Missouri ..... 9 Louisiana ..... 6 New York ..... 5 Alabama ..... 4 Florida ..... 4 New Jersey ..... 3 Texas ..... 3 Maryland ..... 2 Massachusetts ..... 2 PRIME DEFENSE CONTRACTS State Per Cent California ..... 41.4 New Jersey ..... 6.3 New York ..... 6.2 Massachusetts ..... 5.9 Washington ..... 5.4 Colorado ..... 4.1 Pennsylvania ..... 4.1 Maryland ..... 3.7 Florida ..... 2.8 Arizona ..... 2.4 Texas ..... 2.3 (Remainder widely scattered.) To a certain extent these figures present an incomplete picture since they do not reflect the fact that a considerable portion of the dollars find their way into other states through subcontracts or purchase of supplies or materials. A space agency study, for example, shows that 12 of its major prime contrators in fiscal 1963 subcontracted about a third of their work to 1,284 subcontractors in 40 states. Even with this subcontracting, however, there is still a high degree of regional concentration. The geographical distribution of the prime contracts, after first and secondtier subcontracting, was California, 44.7 per cent; New York, 10.6; Pennsylvania, 7; Minnesota, 6.1; Florida, 5.5; Massachusetts, 4.8; Connecticut, 3.8; Maryland, 3.2; Iowa, 2.7; and Arizona 1.6, with the rest scattered. Accompanying the regional concentration has been a concentration of contracts in relatively new companies. In fiscal 1963, 10 concern received 64 per cent of the contract dollars awarded by the space agency. The same concern also generally ranked high among defense contractors. The Defense Department has noted with concern the regional concentration of its research contracts but has assumed a somewhat passive attitude about dealing with the problem. The defense position is that it must award contracts on the basis of “merit” and that it is up to the local communities and industries in the “have not” regions to increase their technical capabilities for competing on defense contracts. Perhaps because it is still a young, adventuresome agency with considerable political leeway, the space agency has assumed a decidely activist role in meeting the regional prob1em. In fact, James E. Webb, the agency head, has become a salesman, flying around the country to enlist new regions, new universities, new industries in his expanding space program. Mr. Webb's approach is to work through the universities with grants for research, fellowships and building construction. In return, the universities assume an obligation to study how the space research can be translated into commercial products and to work with local industries in strengthening their technological capabilities. In many ways, the approach being followed by Mr. Webb corresponds to the civilian technology program proposed by the Administration. But as Mr. Webb likes to point out, he is doing something while everyone else is still talking. Some of Mr. Webb's more cynical colleagues within the Administration also point out that in the process Mr. Webb is broadening the political support for his increasingly expensive space program.

1013-> Hanoch Greenfeld, Pianist
Hanoch Greenfeld is a pianist whose playing has in the past been noted for its poetic sensitivity. Late yesterday afternoon in Carnegie Rental Hall, in presenting the first of three programs of Mozart sonatas, he indicated that he was going to adopt an impersonal attitude to this music. The first program began with Sonata No. 1 in C (K. 279) and continued unchronologically with the Sonatas in D, F, B flat and C (K. 311, 332, 570 and 330, respectively). Mr. Greenfeld played the first three of these in a strong, clear, straightforward style. The tempos were never too slow or too fast; the rhythms were almost rigid in their steadiness. Details of phrasing and ornamentation might have been questionable, but the notes were cleanly articulated within firm contours. Such performances are serviceable for hearing the sonatas pure and simple, but it is possible to find in the works—and project—much more musical interest without sentimentalizing or falsifying. Six sonatas each will make up Mr. Greenfeld's remaining programs in this cycle on the next two Sundays.

The bill would set up an international commission, made up of United States and Canadian members, to supervise the park, which is entirely in Canadian territory. A bridge connects the island to the mainland at Lubec, Me. The home is owned by Dr. Armand Hammer and the Hammer family of California and New York, art dealers, who offered the house to the United States and Canadian Governments as a park. Legislation to set up the park is pending in Canada. Annual operating costs are estimated at $50,000. All costs will be shared by the two, countries.

1016-> LEGISLATORS FACE FINAL-WEEK RUSH; Most Major Issues Pending With Just 3 Days to Go
ALBANY, March 22 — With adjournment scheduled for Wednesday, the New York Legislature will attempt to solve in the next three days most of the major issues it faced when it convened 11 weeks ago. Because of the prolonged fight over additional school aid, which held up enactment of Governor Rockefeller's budget until yesterday, decisions on many bills have been deferred. Holding top interest in the closing days will be the action the legislators take on a new code of ethics for themselves and what they do about revising the liquor laws. On both of these questions, the Legislature has had the benefit of recommendations made by outside study groups, which at best will be accepted only in part. The Assembly is scheduled to debate the ethics issue tomorrow. It will have before it two bills incorporating the recommendations of a study committee headed by Cloyd Laporte, chairman of the New York City ethics committee, and an alternate bill drafted by the ethics committees of the Legislature. While Speaker Joseph F. Carlino has insisted that both the Laporte proposals and the Legislature's own bill be reported out of committee, the Senate leadership is expected to limit consideration to its own bill. The main difference between the two versions is that the Laporte committee recommended that legislators be barred from practice before the Court of Claims and before most state agencies, while the Legislature's bill would permit such practice provided fees were not contingent upon the outcome of litigation. Governor Rockefeller has admonished the Legislature twice in the last week that it “cannot go home without taking strong, effective action on ethics.” But he has not insisted that the Laporte proposals are the only ones that are acceptable to him. The main issue on the liquor question is whether retail pricefixing on bottled goods is to be outlawed. This was among the proposals of a Moreland Act commission named by the Governor a year ago in the wake of scandals in the administration of the liquor laws. The liquor industry has strongly opposed eliminating price fixing, and until the last few days it appeared that its case had been won. However, bills to end price fixing have been sent to the floor in both houses and prospects for passage have brightened. Two other liquor bills, one ending the requirement for meals in taverns and the second eliminating the distance requirement between package stores, now appear to have a good chance of approval. The following is a status of other major pending issues: Housing—The Assembly is expected to reconsider the administration bill for a $165 million bond issue and subsidies to settle low‐income families in in middle‐income housing. Presentments—The Senate is expected to pass a bill adding safeguards to an Assembly bill restoring the right of grand juries to make presentments. Full Crew—The Assembly appears unlikely to pass the bill repealing the law that mandates the minimum size of train crews . Racing — Passage appears certain for an amended bill increasing the New York Racing Association's franchise tax, permitting state audits of the association's records and extending the 1 per cent extra share of the betting pool to enable the association to rebuild Belmont Race Track. Discrimination—The Assembly is expected to reconsider a bill that would outlaw discrimination in the selection of persons for job‐training apprenticeships. Theaters — Favorable action is expected on bills to set up accounting procedures for theater productions.

1017-> ARMY COURT CLEARS PHYSICIAN OF RAPES
FORT DIX, N. J., March 17 (UPI)—An Army court‐martial today acquitted Capt. Eugene Goldman of charges that he raped two servicemen's wives and committed indecent assault against a third. The verdict was returned after three hours of deliberation. An Army spokesman said Captain Goldman would be transferred from the post, as is customary in such cases. Captain Goldman, 30 years old, former chief of the urology section at Walson Army Hospital, had been charged with having raped Mrs. Barbara Hundley, 27, the wife of an Air Force sergeant, and Mrs. Thelma Hutchinson, 38, the wife of a Navy enlisted man. He also had been charged with indecent assault against Mrs. Hutchinson and Mrs. Carna B. Tilton, 48, the wife of a retired Air Force officer. The chief defense counsel Parnell Callahan, told the court that never had it been proven that any of the women had been raped. Captain Goldman declined to comment on the trial.

1019-> NASSER INSTALLS NEW GOVERNMENT; Draft Constitution in Effect —Assembly Meets Today
CAIRO, March 25—The United Arab Republic swore in a new Government tonight as President Gamal Abdei Nasser's draft Constitution went into effect. For the first time in more than a decade the nation had a.man officiaily in line to take charge in the event of the President's death or disability. Toe First Vice President is Field Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer. President Nasser selected Marshal Amer, who is also deputy supreme commander of the country's armed forces. The draft Constitution sets the pattern for a permanent Constitution to be adopted by the National Assembly, which will convene tomorrow. President Nasser also named three other Vice Presidents: Zacharia Mohieddin, Hussein elShafei and Hassan Ibrahim. All were among the officers who took part in.the overthrow of King Farouk in 1952. Marshal Amer heads the list of, new aides appointed by President Nasser. At least 10 of the new ministers had never held Cabinet posts. The Cabinet contains 11 newly created dgputy premierships and 30 ministries. Ali Sabry, who was chairman of the Executive Council, becamePremier of the new Government. He is the first to hold the post since Mr. Nasser relinquished it in 1956 to assumethe Presidency. Mr. Sabry and the other Cabinet members took the oath of offica in Heliopolis tonight. The deputy premiers will in effect form a super cabinet. Among them is a career diplomat, Dr. Mahmoud Fawzi, who had been Foreign Minister since 1952. The new Foreign Minister is Mahmoud Riad, delegate to the United Nations. Dr. Abdul Meneim elKaissouny, Minister of the Economy. retained his portfolio and becäme Deputy Premier for Firtancial and Economic Affairs, which also administers the Treasury. Dr. Aziz Sidky, Minister of Industry, became Deputy Premier for Industry and Mineral Wealth with direct charge of’ petroleum affairs and light industry. Dr. Abdel Kader Hatem, Minister of Culture and National Guidance, was appointed Deputy Premier of Culture, Tourism and National Guidance. Dr. Hatem for the last two years directed an ambitious tourism program, which became the country's third largest source of foreign currency after cotton and revenue from the Suez Canal. The other deputy premiers are: Kamal Rifaat, Scientific Affairs; Abbas Radwan, Local Administration and Services; Dr. Nour Eddinc Tarraf, justice, Labor apd Youth: Ahmad Abdul elSharabasy, Religious Affairs; Dr. Kamal Ramzy Stino, Supply and Internal Trade: Dr. Muslata Khatil. Communications Affairs, and, Abdul Mohsen Abu Elnur, Agriculture and Irrigation. Under the Constitution, President Nasser, the Vice President, the Premier and the otherCabinet officials are subject to by the oneparty Parliament. Theoretically, it will have the power to “withhold confidence” and force the resignation of any minister or, the entire Government. In practice, this will be hard to do since a proposal of no confidence cannot be voted on for three days. During this time the President can exercise his considerable influence on the Deputies or, as a last resort, he can dissolve Parliament. In that case, new elections must be called within 60 days. The Deputies are elected for five years and the President will serve a sixyear term subject to a plebiscite to be held in March, 1965.

1022-> ‘WINTERREISE’; Fischer‐Dieskau Collaborates with Moore in Superb Schubert Cycle
IETRICH FISCHERDIESKAU has been held by many to be the undiisputed king of liedersingers for some time now, and whenever he has recorded operatic roles, his unerring sense of drama has helped him fill those as well as anybody does today. The baritone has recorded Schubert's Die Winterreise for Angel (two disks, 3640; stereo S 3640) and this information should be enough to send Dieskauphiles running to their dealers. In truth, it is a superb album, the sort of singing that only Mr. FischerDieskau can do these days. It is, at one stroke, the best in the art of interpreting these songs and the highest kind of vocalism — one in which the voice is produced to the best of its potential, the words are sounded clearly and firmly, each with its own stress, and the melodic line a continuous thread. Gerald Moore is the baritone's accompanist as usual.. While he is not one with Mr. Fischer‐Dieskau in all details, he shares the spirit of the performance so that the joint effort is one of unified viSion. One area where the two are not of a mind is how rhythmically to approach a downbeat. Mr. Moorelikes to use slight agogic accents—pauses before stressed beats. Mr. Fischer‐Dieskau more often than not goes right into the stressed note, striking it on the beat. But the natural acoustical property of the voice is such that it comes to its fullest tone slightly after it is initiated. (The piano is of course at its peak when struck.) Some singers manipulate this phenomenon into a way of singing; they begin the note, sit on it, then open it up too late. Mr. Fischer‐Dieskau avoids this by inflecting the vowels similarly to the way one would in speech. As a result, all his notes have fullness and resonance. It would seem that accenting all the words would harm the smooth flow of the melody, but paradoxically, the notes hang together better this way. It is impossible to choose favorites in this wonderful, chill set of Schubert masterpieces. If one likes high drama, then it will be “Einsamkeit” or “Irrlicht.” If passion, then “Erstarrung”; poetry, “Der Lindenbaum.” And it is equally impossible to select the best performance. Suffice it to say that Mr. Fischer‐Dieskau has risen to his own best level in this album and has thereby eclipsed all others. Ned Rorem, a conservative American composer, accompanies five singers at the piano in a Columbia album devoted to 30 of his Songs, composed between 1946 and 1958 (ML 5961; stereo MS 6561). The singers are Gianna d'Angelo and Phyllis Curtin, sopranos; Regina Sarfaty, mezzo‐soprano; Charles Bress‐ ler, tenor, and Donald Gramm, bass. They all sing the songs well and Mr. Rorem's playing leaves nothing to be desired. His pianism is bright and facile and he obviously understands his own phrases. The songs fall into two sorts — short ones having spontaneity and naturalness, longer ones that lose interest in their working out. No change of style is apparent from the earliest to the most recent composition. Mr. Rorem is able on occasion to lapse into a humorous, almost café style. At other times he is almost self‐consciously aware of such oompositional devices as extensions. It is in the simpler songs where his most immediate effects are made—songs like “My Pappa's Waltz,” “Early in the Morning,” or “Rain in But when the intention is bent on more profound matters, as in “Root Cellar” or “The Silver Swan,” the ease of writing seems to fly. The sense of expert manipulation that takes its place, while admirable, is not as refreshing to the poetry. Mr. Rorem composes each song differently, that is, each has a form pretty much decided by the shape of its poetry. This is good. And most of them fall back on an old format, consisting of piano introduction, which states the kernel of mood; piano background, which keeps to one subject, not always the vocal lines; and piano epilogue, which resolves the uncompleted psychological life of the song. Rorem's feeling for vocal line is sensitive. His settings of words is advantageous for clarity, but his harmonies move rather too quickly for the turning melodies to generate friction against them. They also move too fast to anchor the tonality of a song or phrase securely enough for dramatic departure. Since his idiomatic domain is basically a conservative one, although his writing can be sharply spiced with dissonant harmonies, and since his main appeal seems to be emotional in these songs, the criticism seems valid. If the vocal line is set against a background that moves perspective too rapidly, focus is difficult. And when the piano part is busy with conflicting ideas too, the struggle for primacy clouds the directness of expressional intent. For all that, they are singable and wittily enjoyable, which cannot be said of much serious American song‐writing of recent vintaee. The voice of a great singer of the past, Frledrich Schorr, is heard on an Angel disk that presents the bass‐baritone in excerpts from his most memorable operatic role, that of Hans Sachs in Wagner's Die Meistersinger (COLH 137). Schorr was born in 18S8 and sang here as early as 1912 (in Chicago), but he confined subsequent appearances to European houses until 1923, when he sang at the Manhattan Opera House. His Metropolitan Opera debut was made the following year, and he was on the company's roster through the 1942‐43 season. He died in 1953 in Farmington, Conn., where he settled in 1931 as a refugee from early Nazi persecution. Those who remember his Hans Sachs say it was the best portrayal of the role of his generation. This disk is convincing testimony to that claim, for the voice rings with authority while the style of singing is simplicity itself. The words are just spoken out to the music, but what speaking! The voice was that of a true Helderibariton, trumpetlike yet rich and full. There are many fine baritones around today but none of this caliber. In fact, his singing of these “Meistersinger” excerpts not only gives insight into the character of Sachs, but he gives the role such breadth that he imparts profound insights into the opera itself. Should this not be, though, since Sachs holds the keys to Wagner's ideas? Thus the value of the disk stems not merely from being another Schorr album but as a study of one of the greatest operas through a definitive interpretation of the major role. Many Singers Several fine singers from the vintage years 1927‐31 are heard with Mr. Schorr. Eight of the excerpts were recorded in London, the other two in Berlin. Lauritz Melchior is the tenor for the Act III, Scene 1, “Abendlich gluhend,” but the tenor dialogue from Sachs's “Gruss' Gott, mein Junker!” up to that point is taken by Rudolf Laubenthal. The singing of the Quintet is surpassingly beeutiful. Elisabeth Schumann is the Eva, Melchior the Walther, Gladys Parr and Ben Williams the Magdalena and David. The precision of the singing is exemplary; the mood one of serenity and bliss. Sir John Barbirolli conducts this. Other conductors are Albert Coates, Leo Blech, Lawrence Collingwood and Robert Heger. Gota Ljungberg is the other Eva. The fact that the excerpts span five years does not harm the continuity, nor does the switching around of assisting singers for there is an extraordinary consistency hn Schorr's work.

1025-> Police in East Berlin Destroy Escape Tunnel
BERLIN, Jan. 9 — East German guards detected and blew up an escape tunnel under the Berlin wall last night shortly after three East Berlin girls used it to reach West Berlin, the West Berlin police reported today. The tunnel, about 450 feet long, ran from a border house on Bernauerstrasse in the French sector to a coalyardd on the Eastern side of the wall. The West Berlin police said Eastern workers had discovered the secret opening and then had informed the East German police. Eastern border troops were seen climbing into the tunnel for an investigation before blowing it up. Tear‐gas grenades were thrown by the Easterners into the West Berlin part of the tunnel, but the police said nno one had been injured or hurt. The tunnel was the first one built by West Berliners since early last summer.

1029-> POLICE ACCUSED AT LONG BRANCH; inquiry Charges Laxity on Gambling, Arson, Burglary
FREEHOLD, N. J., Jan. 24—A holdover Monmouth County grand jury handed up a presentment today charging the Long Branch Police Department with laxity in gambling, arson, narcotics and burglary case. The presentment to Judge J. Edward Knight in Superior Court did not specify any person responsible nor did the grand jury return any indictments. Richard J. Scudder of Navesink, publisher of The Newark News, was foreman of the panel, which conducted a three‐month investigation of the resort community's police. Prosecutor Vincent P. Keuper of Monmouth County began the inquiry last October after Representative Paul Fino, Republican of the Bronx, N. Y., charged that New Jersey was “a gangland gravy train.” Then Mayor Louis Collichio of Keansburg charged that both Long Branch and Asbury Park were meccas for organized gambling controlled by syndicates from Newark and New York. The grand jury heard officials of the Long Branch police force as well as members of the city administration. Several policemen were asked to submit their financial records. While Long Branch was under scrutiny Police Chief Robert Gurley applied for a permanent leave of absence and Deputy Chief Carroll Green was granted a temporary leave. The Long Branch Mayor and Council named a new acting Police Chief last week. Previous to the investigation there had been a wave of unexplained arson cases and burglaries in the town. Long Branch, which before the turn of the century was one of the leading summer resorts in the East, has a long history of gambling associated with it as a resort. The Phil Daly Casinos and other plush gambling places operated there in the last part of the 19th century and attracted many notable figures from New York, Philadelphia and Washington. The old Monmouth Park racetrack, which preceded the present racing plant at Oceaport nearby, was also a center fcr gambling activities before the days of parimutuel betting.

1030-> Verve Combines Art and Antiques To Form Shops
WHAT does a young woman law student have in common with three actresses? The respective ownership of two new shops, scraped together with verve, imagination, deftness and a capital of shoestrings. The shops are Antiques and Arts, at 320 East 49th Street, and Interiors, at 435 West 24th Street. Miss Nancy Benson, who goes to New York Law School at night, decided to open the Antiques and Arts shop when her collection of 19th‐century American antiques overwhelmed her three‐room apartment. She signed a lease on a small, unlovely store that was formerly occupied by a moving company. Pegboard, painted white, was put over unsightly walls. One wall was peeled down to the natural brick and whitewashed. Comfortably worn oriental runners cut a swath through a pleasant clutter of reasonably priced 19th‐century American china, glass, patchwork quilts and occasional tables that double as display counters. Crowded in wherever there is room is a collection of old wooden clocks in resoundingly good working order that whir, tick, chime and bong the passage of time. Prices for the clocks start at $56. The shop is not all quaint Americana, however. The “arts” half of the name refers partly to contemporary water‐colors, priced from $6 to more than $100. An amusingly eccentric note is sounded by the shop's collection of pop art objects. A mad pop‐art pole with unidentifiable accretions attracts a good deal of attention from a prominent spot in the small display window that fronts Antiques and Arts. At the other end of town, a pole is slated to do the same thing for Interiors. On a recent visit to the West Side shop, one of the proprietors was in the workroom in the back applying yellow paint to a sand‐filled basketball that had been nailed to an eight‐foot pole. Colette Wolff, waving a paint brush, explained that the monument, when completed, would be put outside the shop “to attract attention.” These kindred, eye‐catching devices are only one of many similarities between the two shops. Interiors, before its CinderelIa transformation, was a dark little tailoring establishment with exposed water pipes as its most notable architectural feature, according to its three owners, Diane Mathews, Anne Cotton and Mrs. Wolff. Tons of plaster and ergs of hard work later, the shop was shining under fresh coats of paint and new lighting. The shop sells mostly simple, well‐constructed second‐hand furniture dating from the turn of the century to the eclectic nineteen‐twenties. The styles, when they are identifiable, are largely 18th‐ and 19th‐century American. The pieces are stripped down to the natural mahogany or oak and then oilfinished. The three proprietors do the refinishing themselves in addition to reconstructing some pieces and making some from scratch. The shop also offers a limited decorating service. Tables and chests are generally priced between $100 and $150. Most of the chairs are less than $50. There is also a scattering of decorative accessories, and some craft objects such as the papier mache animals Mrs. Wolff makes. Like Miss Benson's shop, Interiors also carries art. At both shops, abstractions are in the minority, although the paintings look contemporary. Many of the sketches and paintings at Interiors are by Mrs. Wolff's husband, Theodore.

1031-> Propaganda by Bolivians In U.N. Charged by Chile
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., March 5—Chile told the Security Council in a letter today that she would not be induced by Bolivia to enter an “unbecoming game” of propaganda declarations. The letter was the latest in an exchange in whieh each country has accused the other of misrepresenting an incident of Feb. 8 in the Chilean port of Mejillones. Bolivia, in two letters, said that an anti‐Government uprising took place and that Bolivia's flag was raised before the revolt was suppressed by the Chilean Army. Bolivia, which lost her outlet to the Pacific in a war with Chile in 1879, had referred to Mejillones as “territory occupied by Chile.” Chile, in a letter last week. denied that there had been a rebellion. Today she objected to what she called the use of the United Nations by Bolivia for propaganda.

1032-> OFF‐BROADWAY PLAYBILL; OLD AND NEW TRIUMPH IN LONDON
LONDON. FOR the next month or so it will be easier than it often is to answer promptly and confidently the visitor's perennial request for a recommended evening in the theater. A rare unanimity of critics backs one's own unhesitating vote for two entirely different plays ‐ Chekhov's “The Seagull,” in a new production by Tony Richardson, and “Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” with its original New York cast. “The Seagull” season is limited and will end about the same time, in early May, as Uta Hagen and Arthur Hill come out of the Albee play and return to the U.S. The standing ovation that greeted the curtain‐fall at the opening of “Who's Afraid” was described by one critic as “not the least moving part of a staggering evening” and a typical eulogy was The Sunday Telegraph's summing‐up that the cast “performed like a virtuoso quartet to the rhythms of Mr. Albee's prose and Mr. Schneider's direction.” The Daily Mirror, which does not normally regard its vast readership as theater‐minded, nevertheless, reported “a stupendous event” and the town's most‐read afternoon paper, The News, simply stated “brilliant acting in a great play.” Milton Shulman, perhaps the sharpest‐penned of local critics, noted the experience as “terrifying and hilarious.” On “The Seagull,” Shulman thought Vanessa Redgrave added another success to her “already impressive list of triumphant performances” but it was on this point only that any reservations crept into the other critics's raptures. The fact is that Miss Redgrave's tall beauty has a sinewy strength and it does not come easily to her to present a lovelorn, wilting, over‐vulnerable Nina. Hence, the obviously reluctant suggestion that she was not entirely happily cast in this role had some justification. The Times of London man, though, found her final scene “heart‐stopping” and said it could only have been produced by “a great actress.” In the most memorable production of “The Seagull” in the last quarter‐century, Mme. Arkadina was played by Edith Evans and Nina by Peggy Ashcroft. Now Dame Peggy has moved to the senior role, and, whether by conscious effort or not, there was no echo of Dame Edith in her interpretation. There is nothing “grand dame” about this Arkadina and it is the essence of her success that (to quote Harold Hobson) “the great actress's jealousy, her egotism, her lethal playfulness, her preoccupation with her triumphs, do not destroy our sympathy for her.” Peter Finch, faced with that special difficulty of the film star returning to the stage after several years, has clearly gone back to Chekhov's own criticism (addressed to Stanislavsky) of the conventional playing of Trigorin as a sophisticated man‐about‐town. This is a quiet, inward man, and Finch was especially praised for the scene in which Arkadina reclaims him as her lover. The Times made the point that the scene justifiably was played as near‐comedy with melancholy implications. The Observer rated the production as not lagging far behind the Olivier “Uncle Vanya,” of Chichester and the Old Vic, which has now established itself as a classic. The Royal Shakespeare Company's 13‐week season of World Theater opened with the Comédie Francaise production of Moliére's “Tartuffe,” and a factor which had nothing to do with what was happening on stage made almost more news than the performance itself. To get over the language problem, the Aldwych Theater has introduced “lorgnette receivers” or, more plainly, earpieces by which it is possible to receive simultaneous translation. The new and native plays of recent weeks have included one which had a mixed but on the whole respectful reception ‐ Frank Marcus's “The Formation Dancers”and one which found the critics reaching for synonyms for “rubbish.” This was Sewell Stokes's “Mother's Boy,” on which David Tomlinson, who starred and directed, had the wit to bring the curtain down and the house lights up to cut short not only the bows but also some boos. “The Formation Dancers” is a four‐handed comedy about two intellectual husbands (an art dealer and a literary critic) who become emotionally embroiled with an uninhibited girl whose long, tangled hair and jeans suggest the dated word “beatnik.” She was described succintly by The Times of London as “a primitive, promiscuous poetess whose outrageous manners are calculated to attract the hyper‐educated male at a distance and gratify his masochism at close quarters.” But it was generally felt that middleclass adultery is something the British don't do very well. The Daily Express man said he was made to feel like a voyeur in a way which is only permissible if‐as in “Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” ‐the play “finally has something to say about the society we inhabit.” Joanne Dunham as the girl came fairly well out of the evening and the debutant director (Clive Donner, from films) was praised for being briskly stylish and sophisticated. Frank Norman, who had a hit with his first theatrical effort, “Fings Ain't Wot They Used To Be,” has had his second work, “A Kayf Up West,” directed, like the first, by Joan Littlewood. He is again operating in the Soho half‐world but the critical view was that it stacked up poorly against “Fings.” A musical version of Sheridan's “The Rivals”‐“All in Love”‐was slammed,

WASHINGTON, April 13 — The Government is spending more than $4 million a year on lie‐detector tests. Last year it tested more than 23,000 persons. While strapped to the machine, many of these people were also being peeped at by Sunday concealed behind “see‐through” mirrors and hidden microphones. “Big Brother is watching,” Maj. Gen. Ralph J. Butchers, Provost Marshal General of the Army, told the Congressional subcommittee which is looking into the whole thing. Naturally, it is un pleasant to dwell on this picture of our Government using old totalitarian p olice techniques. If it will not give them up, however, it shouldat least start using them, without discrimination, on the Government's kingpins as well as its helots. Fair is fair. If Big Brother is watching, the watched are entitled to know who is watching Big Brother. General Butchers can set an example for his superiors by being the first to submit to a lie‐detector test behind an evil mirror. The first question for him should be, “General, do you think Big Brother is on your side?” If the machine shows that the General believes Big Brother, he would then told that Lyndon Johnson is watching him through a trick mirror. He would then be asked, “General, have you ever, at any time, for even a fleeting second, thought of Lyndon Johnson as ‘old cornpone’ ?” Here are a few typical questions for typical statesmen after they have been strapped to the polygraph and advised that the overhead mirror conceals a network television camera: For Secretary of Defense McNamara: “Why do you always come back from Vietnam looking so happy?” “Is that so?” “Are you sure, Mr. Secretary, that Henry Cabot Lodge hasn't promised you second place on the Republican ticket?” For George Reedy, Presidential press sec retary: “Now, to the best of your knowledge, George, Mr. Johnson has never driven over 70 miles an hour?” For Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina: “You have often said that the Negro is more happily situated in the South than in New York. Now Senator, if you were a Negro—Senator, please I remind you that the mirror is watching your reaction; if you were a Negro, Senator, would you rather live in South Carolina or New York City?” For Governor Rockefeller: “Would you state your candid opinion, sir, of Ambassador Lodge ?” For Senator Barry Goldwater: “Senator, you have had many differing opinions about Social Security attributed to you. Can you remember, sir, just which of these opinions were yours and which ones belonged to your ghost writers?” For Robert F. Ken nedy: “Now as we understand it from these various newspaper stories and magazine pieces, Mr. Kennedy, the idea of dropping out of public life and going off some place to work with children interests you more than the Vice‐Presidency of the United States?” “Mr. Kennedy, have you ever, at any time, for even a fleeting second, thought of Lyndon Johnson as ‘old cornpone’ ?” For President Johnson: “Mr. President, tell us, please, who is Big Brother?” “How do you know that, Mr. President? “Mr. President, why does Big Brother insist on keeping the White House lights turned off?” “Your great compassion for voters of every stripe is well‐known, of course, sir, but we wonder whether —your great humanity notwithstanding, sir—you occasionally feel ill‐disposed to people who have at some time or another, just for a fleeting moment, thought of you as —if you will excuse the phrase, sir —`old cornpone‘ ?” The statesmen, fortunately, are not likely to sit still before a funny mirror for this sort of interrogation. They know that a person strapped to a machine in front of a peek‐a‐boo mirror is bound to end up humiliated. Why does Big Brother insist on humiliating people who don't have the political weight to kick the polygraph, smash the “see‐through” mirror and cackle like a hen for the hidden microphone?

1036-> POLICE SHUFFLED IN WESTCHESTER; Shake‐Ups in New Rochelle, Mt. Vernon and Yonkers Follow State Inquiry
MOUNT VERNON, N.Y., Jan. 27—Shake‐ups are taking place in the police departments of Westchester County's three largest cities as an aftermath of public hearings last October by the State Investigation Commission. Illegal gambling operations of $30 million a year in 16 Westchester com munities were reported in the testimony. Charges of police corruption are still being investigated by a Westchester grand jury. Mount Vernon, Yonkers and New Rochelle departments are involved in the shake‐ups. In Mount Vernon, 39 of the 170 policemen will be shifted Wednesday by order of George F. Kummerle, the Public Safety Commissioner. Different posts will also be taken by eight of the 28 officers and eight of the 17 detectives. Commissioner Kummerle appointed Capt. Carl Widell as head of the Detective Bureau, replacing Capt. John McCaffrey, who will take charge of the Traffic Bureau. Lieut. George A. Johnson retired from the Mount Vernon department after 25 years' service. At the state commission's hearings he told of Christmas gifts he had received from gamblers and other persons, but he denied extending special favors in return. In Yonkers, the Public Safety Commissioner, Daniel F. McMahon, ordered a reshuffling of all 10 police captains and said he was planning widespread changes among the other 331 members of the department. Commissioner McMahon said the shake‐up would give all the policemen a fresh look at responsibilities and an escape from old alliances. Chief William F. Polsen, who was appointed last week, has aided in effecting the changes. In New Rochelle, Mayor Alvin R. Ruskin, said a Police Commissioner, authorized by a new local law, would be appointed next month by City Manager Betty A. Meagher. The Mayor said he ”hopes the Commissioner is an outsider and has the endorsement of the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.“ Mrs. Meagher recently dismissed two policemen for misconduct and has moonlighting charges pending against two others, including a detective indicted for perjury by the grandjury.

WASHINGTON, April 18—The newest thing in neurosis goes by the medical name of  or, the use of the layman's term, “digit dudgeon.” The symptoms are an abrupt rise in blood pressure, a deep red flush, an alarming increase in the pulse rate and violent hand movements. The victim may clench and unclench his hands spasmodically or strike out with fist at inanimate objects—desks, tables, chairs, telephone directories. As he loses self‐control, he goes irrational and commits unspeakable rudenesses. In the aftermath, he becomes morose, brooding, apologetic and loses the capacity to think young. Over a prolonged period, Going the patient slowly comes Slowly unhinged. He loses his will Daft for a vice‐presidency, dwells morbidly on “the good old days,” starts carping about this electronic society and concocting juvenile plots to humiliate computers. It is a short step to disemployment and a quart of 69‐cent sherry behind the pawn shop on Skid Row. J. B., a typical case, tells of his own ordeal in these words: “It has now reached the point where I want a drink every time I reach for the phone. To call home from the office, I have to remember an eight‐digit number sequence. Long distance means eleven digits. One wrong digit and I'm ruined. “I tell myself, ‘You can do it, J. B.’ But every call is a test. I reach for the phone and catch myself thinking,‘Suppose I can't cut the mustard any more.’ “Even when I get through on the first try, I'm wrought up, curt, badtempered and rude. Sometimes I forget what I'm phoning to talk about. ” J. B. experienced Unhinged in his first seizure two a Cramped years ago while tryPlace ing to make a credit‐card call to Baltimore from a pay booth on the New Jersey Turnpike outside New Brunswick. The call required him to dial O (for Operator), recite his credit‐card number (021‐7219‐B18), the Baltimore code (301) and the number of the phone he wanted rung (9647385)—a sequence of twenty digits and one letter. He had run through the first fourteen or fifteen digits flawlessly, as he tells it, when some memory link snapped and he began reciting his Social Security number. On the second try, he blurted out his driver's permit number when he should have given his credit‐card number, and was informed that his card was out of date and that he would have to pay coin for the call. When J. B.' s wife finally found him, he was trying to tear the phone from the booth. The family doctor reminded him that he was no longer a boy and advised him to start golfing on weekends. A prudent man, J. B. decided never to be caught off‐guard again. He kept pocket notebooks which he filled with the accumulating numbers he needed to survive—phone numbers, credit‐card numbers, ZIP codes, license numbers, insurancepolicy numbers, V.A. numbers, club numbers, passport numbers, payroll account numbers, library card numbers, safe‐deposit box numbers, Blue Cross numbers, charge account numbers, etc. Friends began smilThe ing behind his back Tragedy and calling him “Old of J.B. Lumpypockets.” He finally sought professional care when, after trying to deposit some money one day at his bank, the teller demanded his account number. Until that instant, J. B. had never realized that he had an account number. He was calmed by a vice president with the aid of the bank dick. Fortunately, J. B. has an enlightened employer who realizes that “digit dudgeon” is not a vice, but an environmental disease of the age, like smoker's hack and overkill tic. His wife and employer are extending him the understanding he will need to get through to retirement age. Unfortunately, there is no cure. Like all the hidden sufferers of “digit dudgeon,” J. B. is simply obsolete. Evolution will ultimately replace all these sluggards with a new race bred to make life happier for computers. What a pity that J.B. will not be around to admire the marvelous life that the machines will create for man—one of these days. RUSSELL BAKER.

He said several attempts were being made to amend the agreement in the United States Congress. Mr. McEwen, replying to a question in the House of Representatives, said the United States Administration recently negotiated the agree‐ment with the Australian and New Zealand Governments. Under the agreement, Australia voluntarily agreed to restrict meat exports to the United States, he said. Subsequently an amendment proposed in the United States Congress would have required the United States Administration to enforce quotas against Austratlia's meat exports he said, but the amendment was defeated.

WASHINGTON, April 8—Paris reports a movement afoot to drive English out of the French language. Its Tom Paine is Prof. Rene Etiemble of the Sorbonne, whose book, “Parlez‐Vous Franglais?”, calls upon Frenchmen to repel such corrupting Anglicisms as “snack‐bar,” “le knockout” and “dinky toys” before it is too late. The English infiltration of French has been heavy since World War lI, and the professor seems to feel that a France speaking “Franglais” is ripe for plucking by meretricious dollar imperialism. The dollar, warns M. Etiemble, is out “to kill our language.” Citizens of the EngDo You lish ‐ speaking world Speak should not interpret nglench? the attack on “Franglais” as a slur on their tongue. Instead we should seize the occasion to purge our own language of the Gallicisms that make us vulnerable to French cultural colonialism. If France is threatened by “Franglais,” the United States has been subverted for years by “Englench,” an evil language which mobilizes the nasalized “n,” the accent aigu and the silent consonant to bully and demoralize the pure English speaker. The purpose of “Englench” is to destroy the English speaker's psychological security by making him feel like a provincial. By destroying his defenses, it makes him an easy mark for those who are out to gull him. When, for example, the Englishspeaker sees a menu offering “hors d'oeuvres” or “canapes,” he expects the meal to cost more than it is worth. Will he protest? He doesn't dare. Argument might require him to pronounce “hors d'oeuvres,” thus making him the laughing stock of the restaurant. He pays up, feeling cheated, spineless, incompetent and wretched. He is a victim of “Englench.” If “Englench” were The banned, the restaurant Profit would have to use the Motive English term for “hors d'oeuvres,” which is “sorry sandwiches.” The price of the meal would be realistic and the diner would rise from the table without needing his psychiatrist. In dozens of mercantile situations, however, “Englench” undermines economic and mental security. The cowed English speaker pays through the nose when he sees “chapeaux” (overpriced hats); “peignoir” rrobe); “negligee” nnightgown); “chemise” (dress for skinny women); “cinema” (flossy movie); “paté” (liverwurst); “chic” (expensive); “haute cuisine” (fancy cooking); or “potato du jour” (yesterday's potatoes). What a hollow sensation in the purse it produces to enter a restaurant, to ask for a table and to be told, “See the maitre d'.” (Invariably pronounced “mayder dee.” English: “headwaiter.”) How expensive it is to wander into a lunchroom and find it is a “cafe,” or worse, a “bistro. How costly to learn that the local “beauty shoppe” has become a “beauty salon.” “Englench” is Lost Among also a weapon the Englench for the social Speakers destruction of English spealkers. Who doesn't know the feeling of unworthiness that results from being trapped in a room full of people who say “passé” when they mean “over the hill”; “boudoir” when they mean “bedroom”; “rendezvous” when they mean “date”; “béte‐noir” when they mean “monkey on my back”; “au courant” when they mean “hip”; or “bon vivant and raconteur” when they mean “Pierre Salinger” ? The interloper among these “chi;chi” (phony) “connoisseurs” (eggheads) of the “haut monde” (upper crust) feels “naive” (square), “gauche” (like a hick from the sticks), struggles to produce a“bon mot” (an elephant joke), commits a “gaffe” (compliments the hostess on her apartment's atmosphere instead of its “ambiance”) and makes a “faux pas” (stirs coffee with his soup‐du‐jour spoon). Feeling humiliated, he hopes that no “recherché” (way out) wit will give him the “coup de grace” (knife him in the ego). The time is ripe for a deal (“détente”) with France. For a starter, we will take back our “snack‐bar” and “dinky toys” if France will take back its “élan” (pizzaz) and pie “a la mode” (3 cents' worth of ice cream for 15 cents).

1040-> PROGRAM HONORS RICHARD STRAUSS; 2 Song Cycles Presented in Concert at Town Hall
The Friends of Live Music, under the leadership of Eric Simon, made its second contribution to the Richard Strauss centennial in its program late yesterday afternoon at Town Hall. In one respect the program was interestingly dovetaile dwith the first tribute on Jan. 22. That earlier program included Op. 66 “Der Kramerspiegel” (“The Merchants' Mirror”), a song cycle that earned Strauss a rejection because the songs lampooned music publishers. This program included Op. 67, the Six Songs that he wrote to fulfill the contract that was not filled when the lampooning songs were turned down. These accepted songs really up two cycles, one devoted to Three Songs of Ophelia from Shakespeare's “Hamlet,” the other to Three Songs to philosophic texts by Goethe. Each group was interesting and all six songs were sung with sympathy, grace and imaginative understanding by soprano Ruth Morris, with Gilbert Kalish being a particularly helpful assistant at the piano. The Ophelia songs combined two celebrations, for this is the year of Shakespeare's quater‐ centenary. It was interesting to hear Strauss paying tribute to the Englishman. What, for instance, did Ophelia break into when, in mourning for her father. she was a little unhinged ? A waltz, of course, but the snatches were so brief that they did not seem incongruous, and the song as a whole was poignant and touching. The other Ophelia texts were “How should I your true love know?” and “Tomornow is St. Valentine's Day.” The songs deserve more renown than they have. So do the lovely ones by Goethe, especially the one whose opening was translated as “Did I ever council you how to wage wars ?” The songs were bracketed with two works that were tellingly juxtaposed. First came the Serenade for 13 Winds, Op. 7, which Strauss wrote when he was only 17. It is a work of welling sweetness and relatively uncomplicated lyricism. And after the songs came the Symphony for 16 Wind Instruments, which the aged Strauss wrote 62 years later. It was three times as long and much more complicated, but was still lyrical and gave the same welling sense of abundance. Mr. Simon was responsible for the Symphony's introduction to New York on Nov. 22, 1959, and he was again able to perform it because of the Boston Symphony's presence here and the subsequent availability of its expert wind players. The men played it again with skill and affectionate understanding. They also participated in the Serenade. Mr. Simon's two Strauss concerts may have presented only peripheral Strauss — the operas are the core of his work — but for the very fact that this was Strauss away from the best known made the programs the more welcome. Strauss was such a giant that only now are we catching up with his whole utput. What could be better ibute than to revive and reveal the surrounding works? No man wants only his famous pieces performed.

1045-> FIRE IN TENEMENT KILLS 6 IN HARLEM
A mother and five children were killed and a sixth child was critically burned in a Har­lem tenement fire early yester­day at 129 West 116th Street. Surging flames, and a door that had been nailed shut to bar intruders, frustrated at­tempts by the father of three of the dead children to rescue the trapped victims, he told the police. The blaze apparently started from a cigarette dropped in an overstuffed chair. Fire Commissioner Edward Thompson called the fire a “di­rect result of adult careless­ness.” He said the children might have been saved if the door had not been nailed shut. But the Commissioner was at a loss to explain why nobody in a crowd that watched the fire for a time had turned in an alarm. The fire was noticed by the crew of Engine Company 58, who saw smoke pouring from the fourth floor of the tenement Commissioner Thompson said the woman and children, in­cluding the survivor, were. crowded against the nailed door when firemen broke in with axes. The dead wers Mrs. Jane Rod­riguez, 47 years old, and two of her children, Jeffrey, 8, and Vic­tor, 7; Tommy Lee Byrd. 10, his brother Josh, 6, and sister Ter­ry, 5. Joyce Byrd, 13, was alive but badly burned. At Harlem Hospital yesterday her condi­tion was described as very poor.

He put the fire out, or so he thought, and left Shortly before 5 A.M., he said, he heard a commotion and rushed across the hall. Flames prevented his entering the Rod­riguez apartment at the front, and the nailed door barred him from the rear. The apartment was a com­plete ruin yesterday, and the flat next door had been dam­aged.

1047-> TWIN CITIES CRITICS PRAISE NEW OPERA
MINNEAPOLIS, Jan. 10 —Critical appraisals today of the Center Opera Company's debut last night at the Tyrone Guthrie Theater were generally favorable. The company performed two operas, a premiere of “The Masque of Angels,” by Dominck Argento, resident composer at the University of Minnesota' and “The Masque of Venus and Adonis,” by John Blow, a 17thcentury Englishman. Commenting on the Argento, Dan Sullivan of The Minneapolis Tribune, said, “It is a consumnate work of art.” John H. Harvey of The St. Paul Pioneer Press wrote, “Using a variety of techniques, Argento's style is gracefully melodic in essence and very resourceful in means. A great variety of textures is obtained in the interplay of individual voices, instruments and various choral components.” Reactions to the 17th‐century opera were mixed. Mr. Sullivan said it was “prettily staged and sung, but far less impressive than Argento's glowing masterpiece.” Edwin L. Bolton of the Minneapolis Star said, “it had to offer baroque charm and touching sentiment and fine vocal work.” All three critics praised, in additton to individual performances, the dancing of the First Chamber Dance Quartet of New York and the singing of the Minneapolis Madrigal Singers.

1052-> PROPERTIES SOLD BY CITIES SERVICE; Units in Ontario and Quebec Go to British Petroleum
The British Petroleum Company, Ltd., has agreed to purchase the marketing and refining properties of the Cities Service Company in Ontario and Quebec, the companies announced yesterday. The price to be paid for the properties was not disclosed. The transaction is dependent on the satisfactory conclusion of many details. Also, it is subject to the exchange control in Britain and to the approval by the boards of directors of each company. The properties involved in the transaction include a modern refinery, completed in December 1958, of 25,000 barrels a day capacity and about 750 retail outlets, of which some 260 are company‐owned. The retail outlets are predominantly in Ontario, with the balance in Quebec. The Cities Service Company has exploration and producing oil and natural gas properties in western Canada, but these are not involved in the proposed transaction. British Petroleum said the acquisition of these Cities Service properties in Ontario and Quebec would fit very well in its long‐term Canadian plans. The Cities Service refinery is the most modern and highly automated refinery in Canada and the chain of service stations is predominantly in Ontario. British Petroleum explained that these facilities would complement exactly its present refinery and marketing arrangements in Canada.

1057-> Emerson Crushes Pilic in Final of Houston Tennis; AUSSIE TRIUMPHS IN STRAIGHT SETS; Then Teams With Fletcher to Defeat Palafox and Osuna in Doubles
HOUSTON, April 19 (AP)—Topseeded Roy Emerson of Australia smashed his way to a 6‐1, 6‐4, 6‐2 victory over Nicola Pilic of Yugoslavia today to win the 30th annual River Oaks tennis tournament. Emerson's victory marked the fourth year in a row that a foreign star had won the tournament. Emerson then teamed with Ken Fletcher, also of Australia, to win the doubles final from the top‐seeded pair of Rafael Osuna and Antonio Palafox of Mexico, 6—2, 6—3. Emerson had twice been a finalist, but he had never won the title. He lost in the final to Rod Laver, also of Australia, in 1961 and 1962. Last year he was upset in the quarter‐finals by Hamilton Richardson of Dallas. Pilic, a tall left‐hander and the No.1 amateur of Yugoslavia, was the first unseeded player to reach the final in 10 years. Emerson had little trouble with Pilic in a match that lasted about an hour. He broke Pilic's service seven times. The Australian had advanced to the final earlier by defeating Boro Jovanovic, another Yugoslav, 10‐8, 6‐8, 6‐2, 7‐9, 6‐4. The match was called yesterday because of darkness with Emerson leading 3‐2 in the final set. The three‐hour battle was the longest of the tournament. Pilic rallied yesterday to upset Osuna, 7‐5, 0‐6, 1‐6, 6‐2, 6‐2.

1058-> ‘Two China’ Policy Rejected by France
PARIS, Jan. 29 — France moved today toward acceptance of a Chinese Communist condition on diplomatic recognition by declaring that the “two Chinas” thesis had no meaning in international law. A statement, circulated shortly after a Cabinet meeting, also included a broad hint that France would support Peking for admission to the United Nations. Yesterday an official spokesman denied that there was any “condition” that France would end diplomatic ties with Nationalist China. Alain Peyrefitte, Minister of Information, reported that President de Gaulle and his ministers had discussed the dispute that arose with Peking because Paris continued to maintain diplomatic ties with Nationalist China after having recognized the Communist Government. Yesterday, the Chinese Communist Foreign Ministry issued a virtual demand that France break relations with the Nationalists and end the “two Chinas” policy established Monday when France announced recognition. The Paris statement, quoting well‐informed French sources, a formula used to describe Government spokesmen, said: “The thesis of two Chinas has no meaning in international law and there is no example of a capital having an equal [diplomatic] representation of two governments of the same country.” This agreed with the contention made yesterday by the Chinese Communists. The Fr.ench Government, apparently playing for time, noted that there were not as yet two representatives of China in Paris. “As for the future, we will see, when the time comes, what changes should be made,” the statement continued. Allied diplomats considered this a clear indication that the Government was weighing a modification of its attitude toward the Nationalists once the Communist mission arrived here. The Government, qualified sources said, hopes that in the three months that will elapse before ambassadors are exchanged, something will turn up that will enable France to alter her recognition of the Nationalists as the Government of China to the recognition as the Government of Taiwan. No engagement was made by the French Government on supporting the Peking regime in the United Nations, the statement said. “But in fact,” it added, “the governments which recognized Peking always voted in favor of the admission of the Peking Government.” There could be no clearer indication, observers believed, of France's intention to back the Communists the next time a vote was taken on the issue in the United Nations General Assembly. Foreign Minister Maurice Couve de Murville reported, to the Cabinet on the foreign reactions to the recognition of Peking. Only three Governments, those of the United States, South Vietnam and Nationalist China, reacted unfavorably e said. The French have not vet chosen the diplomat to go to Peking as chargé d'affaires to open the embassy. Two naxes mentioned in official quarters today were those of Claude Chayet, Consul General in Oran, and André Saint‐M'Leux, Consul General in Hong Kong. Sung Chi‐kuan, deputy director of European affairs in the Chinese Communist Foreign Ministry, has been mentioned here as Peking's selection for the post in Paris.

1060-> ARKANSAS VOTE LAW IS DECLARED INVALID
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., March 27 — The Arkansas Legislature passed a voter registration bill today, ending a special four‐day session called by Gov. Orval E. Faubus. The Governor signed the bill at 11:30. A. M. and two and a half hours later the act was challenged by a test suit in Chancery Court. After a 50‐minute hearing, Chancellor Guy E. Williams ruled that the act violated an amendment to the State Constitution listing the poll tax among the qulalifications to vote Judge Williams said the new law was valid only to the extent that it established a system of registering voters for Federal races on the ballot. This means that the poll tax will be required for voting in state and local races this year, if his ruling is upheld by the State Supreme Court. The decision was appealed immediately. The law made the sheriffcollector of each county the voter registrar and contained a stop‐gap provision for registering this year, and an annual registration program beginning in January, 1965. Enactment of registration law became imperative as a result of the 24th amendment to the United States Constitution abolishing the poll tax requirement in Federal races.

1064-> T.V.A.‐30‐Year Success Story
The Tennessee Valley Authority's 30th annual report shows that those who had the foresight to harness this major river system left a growing heritage for the people in seven states. T.V.A. remains one of the great accomplishments of Federal enterprise. It is an institution essential to the life and higher standard of living of millions of Americans. The spiral of erosion and soil depletion on farms and in forests has been reversed, agriculture has been improved and modern forestry methods inaugurated. Homes, farms, industry and major Federal defense and space installations have benefited from the electricity generated by T.V.A. The demand for power has long since outstripped the region's hydroelectric resources; two‐thirds of the generating capacity today is in steam‐electric plants. In fiscal 1963, flood control recreation development, municipal and industrial water supply, even health and educational facilities were initiated with the help and coordination of state governments. Several months ago Senator Barry Goldwater said he was quite serious about his proposal to sell the vast T.V.A. complex to private industry. But T.V.A. is too deeply ingrained in the lives and communities of Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Kentucky ever to be sold off to private interests. The people of these states like it, need it, live by it. T.V.A. is a success story.

1066-> Author Quits 2 Posts to Protest New Jersey's‘Indifference to the Arts’
Selden Rodman, author and critic; has resigned from two New Jersey advisory commissions in protest against the state's attitude toward the arts. In announcing his resignation yesterday, Mr. Rodman complained that Gov. Richard J. Hughes “has done nothing to change New Jersey's historic record of official indifference to the arts.” Mr. Rodman was particularly critical of the New Jersey Tercentenary Arts Commission, which sponsored the connstruction of the state's pavilion at the World's Fair. Depicting the modernistic pavilion as “21 toothpicks supporting a roof,” Mr. Rodman said it “disguises Trenton's fear of paintings neatly by having no walls on which to hang them.” Mr. Rodman's letter of resignation, dated April 4, informed Governor Hughes that he was resigning both from the Tercentenary Arts Commission and from the State Arts Commussion recently set up by the Legislature to study the arts in New Jersey, Mr, Rodman said yesterday he felt he had failed to persuade the state government to undertake “energetic action” to develop higher cultural standards. He had recommended, Mr. Rodman saaid, that Governor Hughes stimulate artistic achievement by including murals and sculptures in Trenton's new $30 million complex of official buildings. This suggestion, he went on, had received enthusiastic support from the White House as a demonstration of how the arts could be developed on a local level, but “nothing was done in Trenton.” A spokesman for Governor Hughes said that a projected request for an appropriation of $150,000 for cbmmissions of murals and sculptures for the Trenton buildings was scrapped because officials had become convinced it would nq pass the Legislature. The Governor was expected to accept Mr. Rodman'S resignation. The spokesman said Mr. Rodman's statement was “subjective” and that “we have done more during the last two or three.years for fine art than ever before in the state's history.” He cited several statewide art and photographic competitions, a choir series, local art contests and plans for a music center near the Garden State Parkway in Monmmouth County. All these activities, he said, were sponsored by the Tercentenary Art Commission. Plans for the state's World Fair pavilion, he said, were selected in a statewide architectural competition, were not chosen by the state government. Mr, Rodman said he had not wanted to join the groups, which he called “only an excuse” for delaying action by establishing “a monstrous bureaucracy.” The only reason he responded to the request that he serve on them, he said, was his belief that the Governor “desired to make New Jersey a place where great artists and their art would feel at home.” Mr. Rodman's criticism of the pavilion brought acknowledgments from Representative Frank Thompson Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, and Ben Shahn, the artist, that there were “good reasons” for not regarding it a work of art. Representative Thompson also considered a medallion issued by the Tercentenary Commission to commemorate New Jersey's 300th anniversary as “quite atrocious.” Shahn, who is also a member of the Tercentenary Commission said he was not present when the medallion was chosen. He said he intended to “fade away” from the work of the group although he was not thinking of formally resigning. Both Mr. Thompson and Mr. Shahn strongly defended the commission charged with studying the arts' in, New Jersey, however. They thought it had a “very useful” task in seeking ways to imnprove art education in schools. David Davies, executive sec‐ retary of the Tercentenary Com mission, said that the medallion had been selected by a panel after a nationwide competition among sculptors. It was by “sheer irony,” he said, that the winner was a New Jersey artist, Anthcny Notaro of Wayne. Mr. Davics said Mr. Rodman's disenchantmcnt began when the commission rejected a book he had been asked to write about art in New Jersey. Mr. Rodman suggested that the work had been found unacceptable because he portrayed “a very few great nonconformmists in the arts” working against “anindifferent, mate rialistic environment.” The writer had selectedd Patersen to illustrate how a Colonial town of unsoiled beauty had turned into “an inferno of burnt‐out industries, blackened homes and crippled lives.”

1069-> Economic Spotlight
Reaction to the Budget Message of President Johnson was mixed. After all, most business leaders had had time to digest what the President was going to say since he had outlined his over‐all plans inthe State of the Union Message on Jan. 8. There were few, if any, surprises in the Economic Message and the actual budget that followed by one day. Closer analysis of the budget itself provided at least a few topics for discussion. For example, the Administration plans to spend about $5 million more this year to regulate business than it did in fiscal 1963‐64. This would be a rise of about 5 per cent and would indicate that business practices would be under sharp scrutiny in the months ahead. If Congress pass;es legislation to expand policing activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission itself, the figure could go even higher. The Aerospace Industries Association of America, Inc., analyzing the budget closely, pointed out that the most significant proposals that would affect commercial and other users of transportation included the following: ¶Continuance of the 5 per cent excise tax on air passenger transportation that would have expired on July 1. ¶Institution of a 5 per cent tax on air freight. ¶Extension to jet fuels, now untaxed, of the present 2‐centa‐gallon tax on fuels used for commercial air transportation. ¶An increase from 2 to 3 cents a gallon of the tax on all fuels used in general aviation. ¶Initiation of user charges for the inland waterways through a tax of 2 cents a gallon on fuels used in transportation on such waterways. The trade association also pointed out that the budget provides for an addition to the number of Minuteman missiles that have been approved. The latest total would be 1.000. Research on vertical take ‐ off fighter and transport planes. plus design studies on an intercontinental strike aircraft will be continued, but no new funds have been requested for supersonic transport development, which will have to continue on the $60 million available from prior years. The Aluminum Company of America announced on Monday that it planned to keep its ingot price at 23 cents a pound and not follow an increase to 24 cents instituted by the Reynolds Metals Company on Jan. 16. Once the mighty Alcoa had reported its intention of keeping the lower price level Reynolds the Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation and Aluminium. Ltd. decided to rescind their increases.  Market sentiment reflected this immediately after the onefor‐four split was announced on Tuesday. It traded at about 550 a share on noon of that day and fell immediately 7 points after the split was announced. The final quotation of 542 was down 10 points for the day. By the end of the week, however, I.B.M. was quoted at 546. Stockholder approval at the annual meeting on April 28 is required to effect the split and a tentative record date of May 5 has been set. The history of the I.B.M. stockholder who bought 100 shares in 1914 shows a fantastic growth record. He would have paid $2,750 for those shares then. If he had invested no further cash in the company since then, he would have accumulated 15,433 shares. Based on the closing price last Tuesday, his shares would have a market value of $8,364,686. In addition, he would have received $378,800 in dividends and $54,900 for the sale of rights issued by the company over the 50 years. The figures were prepared on request by one of I.B.M.—s own computers. GENE SMITH.

1073-> Chief of Rhodesian Trust Urges Copper Men to Hold Price Line
The case for maintaining copper price stability was argued here last night by one of the men who has kept world copper in a price straitjacket more than two years. Sir Ronald L. Prain, chairman of the influential group of African copper mines known as the Rhodesian Selection Trust, Ltd., rested his plea upon competitive threats from other metals. He also cited the increasing world conscience toward underdeveloped countries. “The future prosperity of the copper mining industry,” he said, “will be based on increasing production, consumption and turnover, rather than on a higher profit margin.” Sir Ronald spoke at the Roosevelt Hotel at a dinner of the Copper Club, which honored him with its annual Ankh Award as the leading contributor to the copper industry. Ankh is the name for the alchemist's symbol for copper. The copper industry is cur ently debating whether a continued stable price is possible in view of rising world consumption and threats of inter’ rupted production from strikes and from political and social ’ unrest in copper‐producing countries abroad. Rhodesian Selection, after cutting production in 1960 and 1962 to match falling consumption, is now operating at capacity to meet higher demand. It is also offering copper outside the speculative London Metal Exchange at a price below the exchange level. In these policies it is joined by another Northern Rhodesian copper producer, the AngloAmerican Corporation of South Africa, Ltd., an Oppenheimer family interest. Rhodesian Selection is 46 per cent owned by American Metal Climax, Inc. Sir Ronald has pursued price stability to prevent copper from being supplanted by substitutes, such as aluminum and plastics. He is so identified with the copper industry as to be called “the Commonwealth copper man.”

1074-> Candy Sale to Aid Mothers Seeking Two School Buses
VINELAND, N. J., Jan. 27 (AP)—Mothers of 57 school children here hope that elementary arithmetic and chocolate bars will solve the problem of transportation for their youngsters. The arithmetic and chocolate bars are tied to a plan to raise money for the purchase of two used buses that would take the children to and from their classes daily. Most of the youngsters live within two miles of their schools, and state law provides transportation only for those living farther away. The mothers decided to buy their own buses after efforts to sway city officials to provide transpdrtation had failed. Parents h4d boycotted three elementary schools involved and conducted a walkathon, refusing all transportation. Some mothers also resorted to using a hay wagon to transport their youngsters to classes. If their arithmetic is correct, the mothers will soon have the problem solved. They have bought for 50 cents apiece 14,400 chocolate bars that they intend to sell to neighbors. From the sale, they hope to realize a profit of $2,736, enough for two used buses. There may be a catch. It will be necessary for the 40,000 Vinelanders to eat 3,158 more ?? a month to provide the operating cost of $600 a month.

1076-> GRANITE STATE DEEP IN WINTER SPORTS
LANCASTER, N.H—Winter sports will be the theme of this town's three‐day bicentennial celebration, which begins on Jan. 31: On the agenda for the weekend festival will be snowshoe races, ski races at Mount Prospect and an international motorizedsled Grand Prix at Holton Field. Technically the bicentennial observances got under way last month. At that time, a committee from Lancaster traveled to the state capital at Concord and presented Gov. John King with an ear of corn and 200 shillings in payment of an old debt. The debt dated from 1763, when Benning Wentworth, Governor of Colonial New Hampshire, granted Lancaster its charter. The agreement called for an ear of corn and a shilling as the down payment, with one shilling to be paid every Christmas thereafter. Although the ceremony in Concord last month may make it appear that this month's festival is belated, Lancaster's leaders explain that they are right on schedule. They point out that, while Governor Wentworth granted the charter in 1763, the papers were not signed until 1764. The activities here will provide a fitting prelude to one of the Granite State's biggest winter sports seasons in years. A fish chowder supper will be held at the high school on opening night. The festival's main event, however, will be the Grand Prix races. Entries have been received not only from New England but from Canada as well. Elsewhere in the state, there will be winter carnivals galore, starting with a three‐day celebration at North Conway next Thursday. Newport has scheduled its 48th annual carnival for Feb. 6, and a day later, the famous Dartmouth Winter Carnival will get under way at Hanover. Other college carnivals next month will be held by Plymouth State, the University of New Hampshire, Colby Junior, St. Anselm's and the New England College at Henniker. Dog‐sled races, which have become a familiar part of the New Hampshire scene, will be held in four different communities during February, starting with Wolfeboro on Feb. 1. Other contests are listed for Newport, Pittsfield and for the Bel knap Mountain section of Laconia. The Laconia races, scheduled for Feb. 21, 22 and 23, are again being billed as the world championship. Something of a new trend in the Granite State is the move toward night skiing, and at least eight major areas now floodlight their slopes, one, two or three evenings a week. In past years, the nighttime skier appeared to be largely the same type of person who, in the summer months, headed directly for the golf course after working hours. Unable to ski in the daytime during the week and unwilling to buck the crowds on weekends, many New Hampshire residents have found that schussing beneath the stars does away with many incon veniences. Now it appears that out‐oftown visitors are becoming more interested in nighttime skiing too, if only because it enables them to improve on their techniques under less crowded conditions. Areas that plan to remain open at least a few evenings a week include Arrowhead at Claremont, Brookline; Crotched Mountain at Francestown; Fitzwilliam; Gunstock at Laconia; Moose Mountain at Brookfield; Tenney Mountain at Plymouth and Mount Whittier at West Ossipee. In addition, there are a number of rope‐tow areas throughout the state that are open evenings. To encourage midweek business, numerous New Hampshire resorts are offering reductions of as much as 20 per cent. At state‐owned Mount Sunapee at Newbury, for example, the weekday plan includes five days of skiing, unlimited use of all operating lifts and lessons in the areas’ ski school. The days chosen need not be consecutive. The same package is being offered at the state's other area at Cannon Mountain, in Franconia. It is significant to note that, although last month and the early days of January did not produce an abundance of snow in New Hampshire, the Mittersill Alpine ski center at Franconia thrived with its snow‐making machines while other ski areas without such equipment suffered. The Mittersill machines have been producing enough manmade snow to provide fine skiing from halfway up the 2,000foot‐high resort.

ATHENS, Jan. 26—Economic stability emerged as a top issue in the Greek election campaign today as party leaders ac‐ cused each other with having damaged the national economy for political gains. The election is set Feb. 16. Panayotis Canellopoulos, the 62‐year‐old Radical Union lead‐ er, was charged under the Penal Code with having caused “uneasiness and fear in undermining the public's confidence in the national currency'.” Mr. Canellopoulos said in a speech at Salxonika in northern Greece last Sunday that the rival Center Union party, which was in power last November and December, had wrecked economic stability with “demagogic tax cuts and pay rises” that had led to gold hoarding. Baisl Damalas, former general secretary of the Coordination Ministry, is prosecutingMr. Kanellopoulos under a law protecting Greek currency from false rumors. Radical charges that the Center Union shook the Greek economy after only 51 days in power have dealt a severe blow to the Center's popularity. George Papandreou, the Center leader, said in Salonika today: “What jeopardizes the currency's stability is this dishonest, antinational, treacherous undermining by the Radical Union and its friends who enriched themselves unlawfully.”

1078-> PLAYBOY CLUB LOSES IN COURT OF APPEALS
ALBANY, Feb. 20 (AP)—The State Court of Appeals unanimously agreed today with a lower court's ruling that upheld the right of New York City to refuse to grant a cabaret license to the Playboy Club. No opinion was issued with the decision. The case began when City License Commissioner Bernard J. O'Connell refused in late 1962 to issue a license for the club on the ground that one of the main attractions would be scantily clad waitresses—called “Bunnies”—who would be allowed to mingle with customers in violation of law. State Supreme Court Justice Arthur G. Klein ordered Mr. O'Connell to issue the cabaret license. This order was reversed last April by the Appellate Division. Because it lacked a cabaret license, the Playboy Club, which opened in December, 1962, has never been able to offer entertainment. Yesterday's decision leaves this situation unchanged. For the last 13 months, the club has used trios and other small instrumental groups to provide background music. This is not considered entertainment under city regulations.

1079-> Canal Zone Nearly Surrounds City of Panama, Scene of Riots
The city of Panama, one of the scenes of the rioting in the Republic of Panama, is virtually surrounded by the Canal Zone. The city is on the slopes of the 560‐foot Ancon Hill, It has a population of about 130,000 persons. Adjoining the city to the west is the town of Ancon, where American officials reside. Ancon is the site of Canal Zone hospitals and administration buildings and of the El Panama Hotel, built in 1951. Panama city's Pacific port, Balboa, a terminus of the canal, lies to the southeast. The city's new commercial structures are skyscrapers, but most buildings are of stone with flat or red‐tiled roofs. Older sections of the “new” city, which was built in 1673, consist of Spanish colonial buildings erected along narrow, winding streets. Five miles away are the ruins of the old city, founded in 1519 by Spaniards and destroyed in 1671 by the British pirate Morgan. Tree‐lined residential sections adjoin the commercial area. The canal extends from the southeastern, or Pacific, terminus to the Caribbean city of Colón, Panama's second largest city, which lies to the northwest. The cities are linked by the Panama Railroad and by the Trans‐Isthmian Highway. Colón is situated on Manzanillo Island, between Manzanillo Bay to the east and Limon Bay to the west. Its port is Cristobal, commonly called the Atlantic terminus of the canal. Colón's population is about 52,000. The Canal Zone is a 10‐milewide strip astride the canal. The population within the zone is heavy only near the main cities.

1080-> GRASS DEVELOPER GETS GOLF AWARD; U. S. G. A. Honors Retired Greenkeeper at Merion
Golf shoes of the future that do not damage putting greens and the greenkeeper who discovered Merion bluegrass received attention yesterday at the United States Golf Association Green Section meeting. Henry Russell, the chairman of the organization's Green Section, in session at the Hotel Biltmore, expressed the hope that a shoe manufacturer would soon solve the problem. “We are looking for an ideal shoe to be developed that will not damage greens with holes or scuff marks.” Russell observed, after listening to delegates discuss what is regarded as a controversial issue, “If we get one, I'm sure it will be recommended to all golfers.” A few years ago, the U.S.G.A. conducted a series of tests at Texas A. and M. to observe what effect golfers wearing spiked shoes and those wearing shoes with rippled soles had upon putting surfaces. Dr. Marvin H. Ferguson, midcontinent director of the Green Section, said yesterday that “we found that the spiked shoe did more damage to greens than the ones with rippled soles.” College students wore the footgear during the tests. Flatsoled shoes, however, were not worn. Joseph Valentine, the 78‐yearold retired greenkeeper of the Merion Golf Club, Ardmore, Pa., received an award for “distinguished service to golf through work with turfgrass.” John Winters, the U.S.G.A., president, made the nresentation Valertine, who served at the Merion club for 50 years, is credited with discovering Merion bluegrass, now widelly used for tees, fairways and lawns, where cool‐season grasses grow. Valentine, who was born in Italy, came to the United States when he was 20 years old and joined the Merion staff in 1911. One day about 19 years later, a patch of sturdy grass caught his eye near the 17th tee of the club'e East course. After observing its “better color” and apparent hardiness as it grew in the rough, he decided he would send a sample to the U.S.G.A. After further study, it was found that this was an improved strain of Kentucky bluegrass. Valentine, whose son Richard has succeeded him at Merion described his findings as a “phenomenon of nature.” Mrs. Allison Choate, women's national senior champion from Rye, N. Y. reported that she did not wear spikes when playing golf. She said most women favored small greens on courses. She maintained they would rather “chip and putt” than be faced with “horrendous putts of 80 feet” on large greens. The annual meeting of the U.S.G.A. will start at 11 am. today at the Hotel Biltmore.

1081-> INCLUSIVE, $205, WINS SAN LUIS REY BY NOSE ON COAST; Mr. Contingency Is Second in $59,300 Race—Foul Claim is Disallowed
ARCADIA, Calif., Feb. 15—Inclusive, a 4‐year‐old who hadn't won a race in five starts this year, captured the $59,300 San Luis Rey Handicap today at Santa Anita Park and paid $205.40 for $2 to win. It was the largest payoff in California racing history. The record payoff is $1,885.50, set by Wishing Ring on June 17, 1912, at the old Latonia track. The unsung hero of the rough race nosed out the second choice, Mr. Consistency, and survived a claim of foul lodged by Mr. Consistency's rider, Kenneth Church. Dusky Damion came in third, 2½ lengths farther back. The favorite, Colorado King of South Africa, was fourth, two lengths behind Colorado King. Church claimed Inclusive lugged in on him in the stretch, but the stewards disallowed the claim. Inclusive, ridden by Rudy Campas, returned $14.80 to place and $15.80 to show. The previous record win payoff in California was the $180.60 returnn of Perizade in the Vanity Handicap at Hollywood Park in 1961. Inclusive's lone distinguishing victory before today was in the Texas Handicap at Sunland Park last year. He had taken only three of 21 races in the last two years. The time for today's 1½‐mile run, a tune‐up for the $100,000 added San Juan Capistrano Handicap on March 7, was 2:25 1–5. Betting Odds Change The crowd of 50,822 remained completely quiet until the stewards viewed the race movie. A tremendous cheer went up, however, when the big price was posted on the board. With one entry, a long shot named Repute, scratched, 13 runners started in the turf race. The tote board had had its own race in the betting as first the Mr. Consistency entry and then Colorado King popped up as the favorite. The odds appeared to change each time the lights flashed. Aldershot, who with Trafalgar III formed a triple entry, with Mr. Consistency for the Ann Peppers Stable, took an early lead. Aldershot held the lead for the early stages of the long haul, but Johnny Longden had Colorado King within close range as the pack headed past the grandstand the first time and on into the back stretch. Mr. Consistency was also held off the pace, but coming into the stretch the 5‐year‐old Colorado King, seeking his third straight victory since coming to this country, took the lead. He couldn't hold it, however. as the long shot sensation and Mr. Consistency began their two‐horse duel to the wire. Campas said he was not surprised when Church lodged the complaint. “I thought Kenny would claim a foul, but I knew I had made no contact with .him Both my horse and Mr. Consistency were tiring, but there was no contact,” Campas insisted. A ‘Live’ Horse for Campas The little rider said his agent had signed for the ride on Inclusive. The owners, he said, felt that they had a “live” horse and the weight was right. Campas had to steam off two pounds in the sweat box and weighed in at 104½. Inclusive got out of the gate in seventh position, but dropped back to 10th by the time the horses hit the half‐mile post. Campas then let him go and he began to pass horses. At 1¼ miles he was fifth. He con‐. tinued to close ground after that. “This was the first time I rode the horse. They told me just to sit back and, when I wanted, to move. He moved, and that's just what happened,” said Campas. Johnny Longden, Colorado King's rider, was not in the least disappointed with the potential of his South African import. “We went to the lead with real authority, but my horse just got tired. He's a tough one,though, you'd better believe it ‐he's good.” Longden said.

1082-> FLIGHTS TO FAIR FACE SOME SNAGS; Pan Am Heliport Delayed—La Guardia Still Building
The World's Fair is set to open April 22, but the most novel way to reach it — by helicopter from the top of a 59‐story midtown skyscraper — may not have been legally approved by then. La Guardia Airport, which should be the main aerial gateway to the fair because it is the closest, also will be in less than an ideal state of readiness. These minor difficulties mean that road and rail transportation may be in better shape to handle extra fair traffic than air services will be. But the inconvenience to air travelers is expected to be slight, and temporary. The ride from a heliport atop the Pan Am Building, at 200 Park Avenue, still depends on the outcome of requests for a zoning change and a special permit. These have not yet been scheduled for action by the city Planning Commission. A 'Tight Schedule' Lawyers for Grand Central Building, Inc., which owns the Pan Am Building, say they are pressing for settlement of the heliport question. Opposition from neighboring building owners—on the grounds of danger and noise nuisance—is strong. The Grand Central lawyers concede they face “a pretty tight schedule” in trying to get approval by the time the fair opens, particularly since as many as four public hearings could be involved. La Guardia's problem is not governmental. It is the same problem the city's most popular airport has had since 1958 —unfinished construction. Grading work at the intersection of the two runways will last from late March or early April until July 1. This will require the closing of first one runway and then the other. Work on the airline ticket counters and passenger lounges in the four “fingers” extending from the new $36 million terminal building is running well behind work on the terminal itself. Airlines Bide Time Consequently, the major airlines are in no rush to increase flights into La Guardia — or to return to the field if they have moved away because of the redevelopment work, as Trans World and United did. United said it planned to resume some flights at La Guardia late in April, probably coincident with the beginning of Daylight Saving Time on April 27. T.W.A. said it was thinking of returning about July 1. American Airlines, which has kept some service at La Guardia through the years of remodeling, expects to increase service this summer or early fall. Eastern Air Lines, which has kept its Boston ‐ New YorkWashington shuttle operating at La Guardia throughout the trials of renovation, expects no sudden increase in nonshuttle flights there. New York Airways, the helicopter line that plans to fly from the Pan Am Building to the fair, intends to include in that service stops at other Manhattan heliports and the three major metropolitan airports. Meanwhile the Port of New York Authority cleared the way yesterday for the awarding soon of. a contract to lengthen La Guardia Airport's two runways by 1967 to handle short and medium haul jets. Bids for the work are due Tuesday. A 50‐acre pier, as big as nine modern steamship piers and costing $42 million, will be built over adjacent Riker Channel. This will add 2,000 feet to one runway and 1,035 to the other, making both 7,000 feet long.

1084-> Sinatra Witness Says Defendants Danced on Cash
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25—A prosecution witness testified today that she saw two defendants in the Frank Sinatra Jr. kidnapping case take off their shoes and dance on the ransom money. Mrs. Theresa Gray said that Barry W. Keenan and Joseph C. Amsler, both 23 years old, spread the money on the floor in her apartment last Dec. 12, the day after the younger singer was ransomed for $240,000. “They were throwing it at each other,” Mrs. Gray, 23, longtime friend of the two, testified. “They were playing football with it.” She said the two defendants came to the apartment about midnight and had an earlymorning snack with her and her husband. Later Keenan and Amsler spread the money—some of it still bundled—on a bedroom floor and danced through it, she said. The origin of the money was not learned, Mrs. Gray indicated, until the next day. By that time, she had helped Keenan pick out a new car and Amsler had bought a motorcycle, she testified. Both were arrested by Dec. 14. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents said about $167,000 was recovered at that time. Most of the balance was found with a third defendant. Also charged with having kidnapped and having conspired to kidnap young Sinatra is John W. Irwin, 42. The Federal trial is in its third week. Earlier, another Government witness, Ronald P. Bray, said that he had helped Keenan, accused leader in the abduction, furnish the alleged kidnapping hide‐out in suburban Canoga Park three weeks before the crime. Mr Bray, 21 years old, said that he and Keenan had delivered a bed and other items to the Canoga Park house where young Sinatra was held for two days after the abduction Dec. 8 from Lake Tahoe, Nev. The witness also testified that that he had driven over the route used by the person who brought the ransom. He did this at Keenan's request on Dec. 9, he said, two days before the delivery of the $240,000 ransom. That sum was paid by Frank Sinatra Sr. for the release of his 20‐year‐old son Dec. 11. Regarding the hideout furnishing, the witness said on cross‐examination that Keenan had “informed me that the house was for Mr. Frank Sinatra Jr.” He said Keenan had never mentioned a man named “Wes,” who, the defense counsel says, is “the mystery man” behind the abduction.

1087-> PISTONS SET BACK CELTICS BY 115‐113; Boston's Lead Over Royals Reduced to Half a Game
DETROIT, Feb. 24 (AP)—The Detroit Pistons, behind by 14‐0 at the outset, defeated the Boston Celtics for the first time in 13 games tonight, 115‐113. The defeat, Boston's third in a row, cut the Celtics' lead to half a game over the Cincinnati Royals in the Eastern Division of the National Basketball Association. Reggie Harding led the Pistons with 23 points and 19 rebounds—both highs for him in his 23‐game pro career. With Tommy Heinsohn bagging 11 points, the Celtics boomed into their commanding lead in the first four minutes and gave every indication of romping merrily. But Detroit cut the lead to 6 points 30‐24, by the end of the first quarter, and went ahead, 54‐53, at half‐time. Heinsohn and Tom Sanders sent the Celtics ahead again and Boston extended its lead to 9 points early in the fourth period. But with the score 100‐100, two baskets by Ray Scott and one by Don Ohl put Detroit ahead for good.  G. F. P. Butcher 1 1‐1 3 Duffy 1 0‐0 2 Ferry 3 3‐3 9 Hardng 11 1‐4 23 Howel l 6 5‐6 17 W.

1089-> ‘MYSTERY SHIPS’ PLY CARIBBEAN TOURIST ROUTES
CASTRIES, St. Lucia, B.W.I. —Two small, passengercarrying. cargo vessels, the Federal Maple and Federal Palm, have now celebrated more than two years Of plying the Caribbean. Although these comfortable little ships of 3,200 tons are not well known in the travel industry in the United States, or even in Canada, where they were built about three years ago, they are carrying an increasing number of tourists. The vessels have been nicknamed “the Caribbean's wonderful mystery ships.” The mystery is who owns them and what is to become of them. They came from Canada as a gift to the prospective Federation of the British West Indies when the federation seemed a certainty only a few years ago. Under the plan of those days, the islands of the British West Indies were to be federated as an independent member of the British Commonwealth. But in 1962, Jamaica, the largest of the British islands, withdrew from the project and was followed by Trinidad and its dependent island of Tobago. Since then, Britain has granted thgn both independence. That left eight smaller islands —St. Kitts, Montaerrat, Antigua, Dominica, St. Lucia, Barbados, St. Vincent and Granada—that might form a federation without their bigger sisters. But, for a number of reasons, described as mostly political, this has not occurred and does not seem likely to occur in the near future. What is the status now of the Federal Palm and the Federal Maple ? Their actual ownership is undecided, pending determination of the future of the “Little Eight.” The ships, meanwhile, are controlled by a body known as the Regional Council of Ministers, representing all the islands, and they are administered by the West Indies Shipping Service, with offices in Trinidad and whose house flag. they fly. The large British shipping concern, Furness. Withy & Co., Ltd., operates the ships from its Trinidad headquarters. The two little vessels are now running at a sizable deficit. This is currently made up by grants from all prospective territories of the aborted federation, plus Great Britain. While awaiting political developments, opinion here is that the ships are performing an extremely useful service to all the British West Indies islands. Their usefulness is considered very likely to grow, and it is felt almost certain that they will remain in the Caribbean, for which they were especially destined and designed. The ownership and financial problems of the Federal Maple and Federal Palm are seldom evident to the passenger. The food is simple, and compares favorably with that of most of the smaller first‐class hotels in the Caribbean. Both ships have been kept very clean and both are air‐conditioned. The vessels operate generally on a two‐week schedule, with one sailing south from Jamaica as the other starts north from Trinidad. On the south run, the ships sometimes stop first at tiny Turks Island to pick up a cargo of salt. Turks, a dry, flat island, is a dependency of Jamaica, although it is more than 300 miles away. When Turks is visited, the lost time usually is made up by shorter stops at the most interesting Leeward and Windward Islands. On the south run, the vessels usually leave Kingston, Jamaica, about noon and arrive at St. Kitts on the third morning. Along the way, the passenger gets a good look at the high Blue Mountains of Jamaica and the even higher ranges of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Depending upon freight, the ships normally stay a full day at each of the eight British Caribbean islands between Jamaica and Trinidad. This gives the tourist ample time to visit old fortifications, swim, buy local handicraft, lunch at one of the many new hotels built recently in the Caribbean and take in other sights on St. Kitts, Antigua, Dominica, St. Lucia, Barbados, St. Vincent and Grenada. St. Kitts is best known for the partly restored fortress on Brimstone Hill, once called the “Gibraltar of the West Indies.”Brimstone Hill and the partlyrestored British Naval dockyards at English Harbor, An‐tigua, are historical sights thatshould not be missed by the tourist, and particularly the camera enthusiast. The Windward Islands of Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada offer the most colorful and mountainous scenery, and both St. Lucia and Grenada have excellent beaches and new first‐class tourist hotels. Barbados, the most easterly island in the Caribbean, has fine beaches and the largest number of tourist hotels in the Lesser Antilles. It also gives free‐port status to many items purchased by tourists. The voyage offers the traveler about the widest variety of Caribbean scenery and culture possible in so short a time, and at a relatively` low cost. Including a stay at Jamaica, with its fine tourist facilities, freeport prices and great diversity of landscape, and another at Trinidad, with its colorful mixture of races, cultures and its modern trends in dancing and music, voyagers will have had an almost complete snapshot view of the Caribbean. The French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique can be seen by stopping over at Dominica or St. Lucia, flying to them and then returning to catch the next ship. The tourist who travels south one way from Jamaica to Trinidad, and plans to fly home, can include stopovers at the French islands. The tourist from the United States should plan on spending at least one or two nights in Jamaica. While the ships usually keep to their schedules, occasionally they are one or two days late. In Kingston, where the vessels dock, minimum hotel rates in winter are $7 to $8 a day single, European plan, and about $10 to $12 a day single, modified American plan, which means breakfast and dinner only. While the ships are in port in Trinidad, passengers must stay ashore. Minimum hotel rates in Port of Spain range from about $7 single, Continental plan (light breakfast), to $10 a day, modified American plan. The Federal Maple and Federal Palm are sister ships. Each has 22 cabin‐class stateroomsand three de luxe staterooms. The cabin‐class staterooms are small—actually too small for two persons to dress comfortably at the same time—but the berths are comfortable. The de luxe cabins, are excellent and have private baths. There is plenty of deck space, plus a comfortable lounge, a small bar and a writing room. Single rates during the winter season for the voyage from Jamaica to Trinidad are $144 for inside cabins and $155 for ou tside cabins. The fare for the de luxe cabins is $288. The winter fares go into effect with the first sailing immediately before Christmas and end with the first voyage after Easter. There is a 10 per cent reduction on round trips. If British West Indies Airways is used for the return passage, a 5 per cent reduction is granted on the plane fare. The ships also carry deck passengers. While the fare ofonly $24, without food, is obviously a bargain for a voyage of about 11 days, only the young, hardy and brash should attempt it. There are 60 berths in dormitories for men and women on a first‐come, first‐served basis, but as many as 200 persons often crowd the small deck space. The only food usually available is sandwiches. Coffee, tea, soft drinks and beer also are sold. During the trip from Jamaica to St. Kitts, there are motion pictures and bingo. Otherwise, the passengers entertain themselves with cards or long discussions on the merits of the various islands. Usually, the passengers are early to bed after full days of sightseeing, and the bar and lounge are deserted by 9 or 10 P.M. There are few complaints by passengers, and generally they are very happy ships. With the increase in passengers, reservations should be made well in advance, either through the Furness, Withy branch in New York, or through a travel agent.

1090-> SINATRA WITNESS TELLS OF PLOT TIP; Says Kidnapping Defendant Informed Him of Plan
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 24 (UPI) —Dean Torrence, rock 'n’ roll singer, provided a surprise twist to the Frank Sinatra Jr. kidnapping trial today when he admitted under oath that he had “made up” some previous testimony and said that he had advance knowledge of the kidnapping. Mr. Torrence also contradicted earlier testimony by disclosing he had received $25,000 of the $240,000 ransom. He said he had turned it back to one defendant two days later without actual participation in the scheme. The defense had said Mr. Torrence was the “mystery singer” who had financed the kidnapping last December as a publicity hoax for young Mr. Sinatra. But this morning Mr. Torrence denied any knowledge of the kidnapping. This afternoon he asked Prosecutor Thomas Sheridan if he could make some changes in his testimony. His admissions upon returning to the stand led Federal District Judge William East to say perjury had been committed. “I'm desperately disturbed about it,” he said, indicating he would decide later what action to take. Mr. Torrence told the court this afternoon, “I'm afraid I made up some stories.” But he again denied he had oeen told the kidnapping was a hoax, and also said he did not participate. He said his best friend, Barry Keenan, a defendant, had told him last October about his plans for kidnapping young Sinatra. The defense was unable to draw any statement from him to confirm its argument that Frank Jr. had consented to be kidnapped. It did draw an admission that Mr. Torrence had given Keenan money in late November. Asked why he had given Keenan money for other purposes after his friend told him of his plans, Mr. Torrence said: “It all seems like a story book. When someone comes up to you and tells you he's going to kidnap someone, you don't really believe it.” Mr. Torrence said Keenan did not tell him who else was involved in the scheme. Defendants with Keenan, 23 years old, are Joseph Amsler, 23, and John Irwin, 42. Mr. Torrence said the money he had given Keenan was for “his living expenses, for his divorce and other things. I didn't know it was for a kidnap.” Mr. Torrence said Keenan on Dec. 11—the day the ransom was paid—had brought him a paper sack containing about $25,000. He said he returned the money two days later. “I'd been such a fool,” the witness said. This morning Mr. Torrence denied Keenan had brought him the $25,000. Mr. Sheridan asked Mr. Torrence this afternoon, “Did you participate in the kidnapping of Frank Sinatra?” “No sir, I didn't.” “Were you ever told it was a publicity stunt?” “No.” ‘Were you ever told the kidnap was a hoax?” “No.” The defense won a motion to have both Frank Sinatra Sr. and Frank Jr. testify on behalf of the defendants. Young Mr. Sinatra is to return here from Europe Thursday.

1091-> SINATRA KIDNAPPING GOES T0 TRIAL TODAY
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 9—The Federal trial of three alleged kidnappers of Frank Sinatra Jr. starts tomorrow. Barry Worthington Keenan, 23 years old; Joseph Clyde Amsler, 23, and John William Irwin, 42, have pleaded not guilty to a six‐count indictment charging that they kidnapped the 19‐year‐old singer from a Lake Tahoe motel last Dec. 8. Conviction could carry a maximum sentence of life in prison, plus 75 years, and a fine of $35,000 for each man. A death penalty can be imposed only when the kidnap victim has been harmed. Young Sinatra was not harmed. The selcction of a jury is expected to take up most of the trial's first day in the Federal Building courtroom. Opening arguments before United States District Judge William G. East will follow either late tomorrow or Tuesday. About 24 witnesses subpoenaed by defense attorneys have been ordered to appear tomorrow. Young Sinatra, his father and mother were also subpoenaed to testify. The son was reported to be flying home from Germany following a European singing engagement. The subpoenas for young Sinatra and his father ordered them to bring records of all monies received from contracts or any other source from June. 1963, up to last Friday.

1092-> INDIA‐BURMA TALKS ON RED CHINA SEEN
NEW DELHI, Feb. 9—Gen. Ne Win, head of Burma's military regime, flew back to Rangoon today after a 24‐hour visit here during which he was believed to have attempted to mediate in the dispute between India and Communist China. Although Foreign Secretary Gundevia of India said that General Ne Win had come here to inquire about the health of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who has just recovered from a mild paralytic stroke suffered a month ago, Indian spokesmen acknowledged that the two leaders had discussed “matters of mutual interest,” including Communist China. Various proposals for convening a conference of nonaligned countries were also discussed, Mr. Gundevia added. There was speculation that General Ne Win had proposed a meeting in Rangoon between Mr. Nehru and Premier Chou En‐lai of Communist China. The Chinese Communists have been seeking to get India to the negotiation table on the border dispute, but have refused to withdraw from territory they seized in 1962. During the day Mr. Nehru addressed leaders of the ruling Congress party who met at his residence preparatory to a budget debate in Parliament tomorrow.

1094-> Sidelights; Gas Appliances: A Bright View
The gas appliance industry has taken another look at its prospects for the present year and has raised its estimates on sales. Joseph J. Decker, president of the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, said yesterday that three months ago a survey of members indicated a sales gain of only 3.2 per cent over 1963. The latest estimate is for an 8 per cent boost. Mr. Decker, who also heads the plumbing and heating division of American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation, said that much more was involved in this optimism than just the effects of potential tax cuts. The World War II “baby boom” has begun to come of age in a record number of new family formations, he said. This factor, plus normal population growth and obsolescence in existing dwellings, he added, will bring about “the biggest total of new home starts and home modernization projects ever recorded by the housing industry.” Members of the trade association placed 1964 private nonfarm housing starts at 1.62 million units, including multiple dwellings—a 4 per cent increase over 1963. Mr. Decker also noted that the gas industry will spend $;1.74 billion for construction this year, adding 28,700 miles of field, transmission and distribution pipelines and mains. Directors of the Fifth Avenue Coach Lines, Inc., announced yesterday that the annual meeting will be held March 20 at 10 AM. in the Biltmore Hotel. Stockholders of record on Feb. 20 are eligible to vote. The meeting date may be especially important in that Kenneth P. Steinreich, president, predicted that the City of New York will have ended by March 15 its case against the company's claim for $;112,523,000 for seized properties of the Fifth Avenue and Surface Transit Bus System, plus “consequential damages.” Mr Steinreich noted that the highest appraisal submitted on behalf of the city amounted to $;22,467,000, which, he added, “does not include intangibles and is without reference to claims for consequential damages.” He advised stockholders that “as the trial for the award to the company through condemnation draws to a close, we are thorougnly examining the tax and other aspects of the dividend action to be considered when the award is received.” The American Express Company started yesterday in Great Britain a new plan for buying its travelers checks by mail. United Press International reported Maxwell Elliott, a vice president of the company and manager for Britain and Ireland, as saying that while this is not the first time that travelers checks have been sent by mail, “we believe this is the first organized mail‐order service.” He added that both purchaser and supplier are “fully protected” against loss in the mails. Pacific Northwest mills reported yesterday that prices for Douglas fir lumber and plywood have strengthened in the past two weeks. They explained that mild weather and a good home building outlook for the present year have created market strength. Green fir two‐by‐fours for Eastern shipment are now quoted at $;68 a thousand board feet, up $;5 and about $;3 over the price of a year ago. Sanded fir plywood prices were said to be about $;64 a thousand square feet against $;60 to $;62 in the past two weeks and $;60 a year earlier. The nation's distilled spirits industry announced yesterday reactivation of its National Tax Council of the Alcoholic Beverage Industries. Its purpose is to aid all segments of the industry to oppose any further increases in liquor excise taxes and such state revenue measures as gross receipts taxes, brand Iabel registration and brand label use fees. Charles W. Bryant, former president of the National Alcoholic Beverage Control Association and a former member of the Washington State Liquor Control Board, was chosen executive director of the reactivated council.

1095-> SINCLAIR PAYS COST IN WATER POLLUTION
PROVIDENCE, R. I., Feb. 9 The Sinclair Refining Company has completed payments totaling $65,990 to defray expenses incurred by the state and two municipalities in removing oil that escaped in the grounding of one of its tankers. The payment, believed to be the first of its kind in Rhode Island, was seen as evidence of increased social eonsciousness on the part of tanker operators over accidental oil pollution of coastal waters. Sinclair paid $33,500 to the state, $30,000 to Newport and $2,‐4 50 to Jamestown for removing oil cargo that escaped from ruptured tanks of the vessel P. W. Thirtle when it ran aground in fog in Narrangansett Bay on Sept. 1, 1961. The am ounts were arrived at in negotiations between the company and local officials. There was no litigation. Approximately 339,000 gallons of bunker oil escaped from the tanks of the vessel which was inbound from Texas City, Tex., to Providence. The thick, heavy oil coated beaches and docks for weeks before it was removed. The accident precipitated a special legislative investigation ,into the antipollution methods employed by oil terminals and tanker operators, which is still continuing. At least two other tanker operators, one American and the other British, have expended large sums to hire contractors directly to clean up accidental oil spills in Narragansett Bay in recent months.

1096-> NEWS NOTES: CLASSROOM AND CAMPUS
A faculty committee at the Harvard Graduate School of Education will survey graduate programs in education through out the country and draw up a blueprint for the future course of the school, Dean Theodore R. Sizer disclosed last week. The committee will examine all aspects of the curriculum and will not limit its recommendations to Harvard. Instead it will try to establish priorities for university schools of education in general. “This is the first time that any faculty of education will have undertaken a study of this scope,” Dr. Israel Scheffler, professor of philosophy and ed ucation, and chairman of the new committee, said. As outlined by Mr. Sizer, the study will have three principal aims: (1) A survey of the current state of graduate study in education In large universities. (2) A prescription of objectives for graduate schools of education in large universities. (3) Specific recommendations for the Harvard Graduate School of Education. In scope, the committee resembles the University Committee on General Education appointed in 1943, which wrote “General Education in a Free Society,” a historic report. Like the earlier committee, the group will invite educators from all over the country to present their views. Members will travel to other universities, and the entire committee will hold working conferences away from Harvard to provide an opportunity for the fullest discussion. While most recent studies of , education Schools have concentrated on teacher training, the committee will give special at-1 tention to Ph.D. programs in education and how trainers of teachers, the so‐called “clinical professors” asked for in the recent report by Dr. James B. Conant, should be educated. As the school year draws to an end two studies have ap‐peared that show where the public schools stand and what the prospects are for the future. The final report on statistics for Fall 1963, issued by the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare, contained the following highlights: A total of 1,576,000 full‐time and part‐time classroom teachers were employed, an increase of 4.5 per cent over the fall of 1962. Some 83,200 full‐time class‐room teachers, or 5.3 per cent of all teachers, did not meet State certification requirements for the positions they held. A total of 40,217,000 pupils were enrolled, 25,817,000 in elementary schools and 14,400,000 in secondary schools. Thirty‐five states and the District of Columbia reported 409,000 pupils attending school for less than a normal school day. Four and one‐tenth per cent, or 1,659,000 pupils, were in ex‐cess of the normal capacity of the schools. Some 59,800 classrooms were scheduled for completion dur‐ ing the 1963-64 school year, an 8.5 per cent decrease from 196263. The total number of additional classrooms needed as of the fall of 1963 was reported as 124,300. The second survey, prepared by the National Education Association, reported that 174,000 potential teachers will be graduated in June, 13 per cent above last year's graduating class. But a quarter are expected to “drop out” of teaching before next fall, leaving a shortage of about 118,000 qualified teachers for coming school year. To share in community efforts to improve the education of children in depressed areas and to salvage unemployed adults, a five‐point program has been initiated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh. Parochial school facilities will be made available to non‐Catholic students, on a tuition‐free basis, and with complete exemption from religious instruction. As announced last week by Msgr. John B. McDowell, superintendent of Roman Catholic schools in Pittsburgh, the plan is “a deliberate attempt on the part of the Diocese to serve a broad community purpose.” Its outstanding feature will be the institution next September of an “open admission” pol icy in four elementary schools in predominantly Negro or ur ban renewal areas of Pitts burgh. Msgr. McDowell points1 out that the schools commit‐ment to Catholic children hav‐king been met, efforts will be made to attract non‐Catholics to fill places which might otherwise be vacant. in endorsing the open‐admission policy, Bishop John T. Wright of Pittsburgh said, “In several communities where unemployment is taking a social as well as economic toll, the local diocesan school is the principal educational agency and has become the natural rally ing point for the friends of our children as well as our own youngsters.” Other aspects of the program include the establishment of a network of study halls, where high school students may do their homework, away from an often distracting home environment; the development of new skills and cultural enrichment among unemployed adults; expansion of the shared time system at secondary school level, to give high school students employable skills; and a remedial summer program in the 3 Rs. Plans are being made to extend the program to other depressed areas in the Pittsburgh Diocese. An academic memorial to the Irish poet, William Butler Yeats will be recreated for the fifth time this summer. It is the Yeats International Summer School, to be held from August 15th to 27th in Sligo, Ireland, under the auspices of the Yeats Society. Sligo, the town closely associated with the poet's life and work, is on the west coast of Ireland. The program offers lectures by scholarly authorities on Yeats's work, small group dis cussion seminars, performances of his plays, and excursions to Innisfree and other parts of the countryside where he lived and about which he wrote. Application may be made before July 1 to The Secretary, Yeats International Summer School, Stephen Street, Sligo, Ireland. The intensity of courses in Mandarin Chinese offered by Stanford University's Center for Chinese Studies in Taipei, Taiwan, is almost guaranteed by the present teacher‐student ratio. There are currently 30 instructors and 25 students in the program, but plans for next fall anticipate an increase in enrollment, possibly to about 40 students. The center in Taipei and the Tokyo Center for Japanese Studies are part of Stanford's attack on the shortage of adequately trained experts in Asian languages. The demand for such programs led to the expansion of the Tokyo center into an intercollegiate effort cosponsored by nine other universities, including Columbia, Har‑ yard, Princeton, Yale and the Universities of California, British Columbia, Oregon, Wash ington and Michigan. The two centers are open to both undergraduate and graduate students. Soviet educators are expressing satisfaction over the results of the science and math “Olympics” initiated a few years ago. Three hundred top students from different regions of the Soviet Union have recently taken competitive tests in these subjects at Moscow University. First place went to the Russian Federation, second to the Ukraine, and third to the Armenian republic team. Education writers stressed that first‐class teaching and knowledge are no longer a monopoly of Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and other large urban centers, but that youngsters from remote points of Siberia, and Central Asia can achieve high marks, both in the team and individual aspects of the “Olympics.” According to a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a number of the questions in,cluded in the Moscow all‐Russian competition would have challenged university instructors in mathematics and physics, but a goodly proportion of 7th and 8th graders were able to cope with them. Leningrad pupils were the best performers. The “Olympics” movement is growing at a rapid pace. Last year about 1,400 youngsters participated in the Moscow‐city mathematics “olympics” this year the number rose to about 6,000 boys and girls. During the summer, early in July, Moscow will play host to the International Mathematics Olympics. Youngsters from most of the Soviet bloc coun‑ fries will compete

1097-> NEWS WRITERS HERE PRESENT 4 AWARDS
Charles Grutzner of The New York Times was installed last night as president of the Newspaper Reporters Association of New York City. He succeeds Robert Mindlin of The Long Island Star‐Journal. More than 300 persons attended the association's annual dinner at the Manhattan Hotel, where 1964 news awards were presented. Richard L.

1098-> IN AND OUT OF BOOKS
is that special day, the one that isn't there three‐quarters of the time, the Feb. 29 which comes only with Leap Year. Here are the books which will be published that day, and make of the list What you will—“American Growth and the Balance of Payments,” by Jeffrey G. Williamson (University of North Carolina Press); “Reform and Reaction,” by Jose M. Sanchez (North Carolina); “Selected Writings of Herbert Read,” with foreword by Allen Tate (Horizon); “Sex and the College Girl,” by Gael Greene (Delacourt Press‐Dial). THE winter banquet season is about over for the baseball players, with the spring training season soon to follow. As usual, the book publishers are in there pitching, too, and while not every list boasts a baseball book, there are a certain number which do. Here, then, are some of the strikes or balls to be aimed at the bookstore, with one of them having a title sounding the way its author does on the air: “You Can't Beat the Hours: A Long, Loving Look at Big League Baseball ‐ Including Some Yankees I Have Known,” by Mel Allen with Ed Fitzgerald (Harper & Row, May); “According to Hoyt,” by Waite Hoyt (World, May); “Stan Musial: 'The Man's' Own Story,” as told to Bob Broeg (Doubleday, April); “Baseball Has Done It,” by Jackie Robinson, edited by Charles O. Dexter (Lippincott, April). This last primarily is an account of how baseball solved the question of integration. Spreviously noted, the forthcoming political conventions and election will bring forth a number of books about such as Senators Goldwater and Margaret Chase Smith, and Governor Rockefeller. There also are to be at least three novels based on politics. Next month, Harper & Row will publish “Convention,” ' by the Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey II, who wrote “Seven Days in May.” Its story concerns a Republican National Convention. In early May, McGraw‐Hill will publish “The 480,” by Eugene Burdick, co‐author of “Fail‐Safe” and “The Ugly American.” The figure of the title represents the voters reduced to computing machine data. From Norton next month will come “ '68,” by Peter Scaevola. Like many a potential candidate, Mr. Scaevola is by‐passing 1964 to provide, in 1968, the setting for a candidate who will do anything to win the nomination and election. weeks ago, the pages of this section carried a review of “Ulysses Found,” in which Ernie Bradford writes of his own tracing of the voyage of Ulysses, as told in “The Odyssey.” With a reddish beard that is just this side of flaming, Mr. Bradford arrived in New York a few days later. On his third visit to the country, he came (“terrified”) by jet. The two earlier visits were made in small boats—crews of a few stalwarts and you sail them yourself. Ulysses took 10 years in the furtherance of his legend, Mr. Bradford took seven. He traveled two‐thirds of the route in deliberately consecutive order, passed over much of the area a good many times in the decade. The ship he used was 28 feet, seven tons, with Mrs. Bradford as cook, navigator. This ship he sold, now has another currently “lodged” at Malta, and the usual Bradford schedule is to write in London half the year, sail the seas the other half. This year the schedule looks dim. He in writing a biography of Sir Francis Drake and the deadline approaches. Mr. Bradford has written 14 books, declines to call himself a classical scholar—although others call him so—and has written not only of the sea but about antique jewelry and furniture. He came by the sea at 18, when he joined the Navy during World War I and found himself in Ulysses territory. During his summer cruises he reads—Jane Austen, Tolstoy—but he finds he can't read in London. His arrival followed by a day or two that of The Beatles. “Now you have the lot,” he said. “The Beatles with a mop of hair on the head and me with a mop on the face.” COUPLE of Government publications came out last week in the hands of private industry. One of these was that report on “Smoking and Health,” which Van Nostrand offered at $3.95 in hard cover. Down in Washington, it has been, and remains, on sale from the Superintendant of Documents for the Government Printing Office for $1.25 in soft cover. The Government printed 50,000 copies, sold 10,000 the first day of sale, now has had sales of about 25,000 copies. The second case was that of “Infant Care,” assembled by The United States Children's Bureau of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Lancer Books publised it at 50 cents, a feature being a washable, plastic binding, always useful in infant care. This was first published in Washington in 1914, sells there for 20 cents, has been revised again and again and remains the Government's . best‐selling book —over 12,900,000 copies sold down the years. The reason commercial publishers can pick up Government publications is that the latter regards them as being in the public domain. So long as commercial publishers follow copy exactly, everything is quiet along the Potomac. Once they start adding material or changing emphasis, however, the whip cracks. in April, Braziller will publish a novel called “The Crossing,” by Alin Albert. The interesting thing about this one is that it is a story about a Negro from the Deep South written in English by a 20‐yearold Frenchman. . . . It happens. Over in Hamburg, David Cornwell told London's Daily Mail that he is quitting his job with the British Foreign Office and will move to the island of Hydra, Greece, to be a professional writer. As an unprofessional and under the name of Richard Le Carre, he is the author of “The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.” It will be noted that book today moves into top position in the fiction section of the best‐seller list, displacing Mary McCarthy's “The Group.” Miss McCarthy has held tenure since last Oct. 6. ... Emily Hahn will write for Houghton Mifflin a biography of Mabel Dodge Luhan, hostess of spectacular salons here and at Taos, N. M. . . . In “Human Behavior,” by Bernard Berelson and Gary A. Steiner, there is a study of marriages, listing four types—“mother‐son, ' “Ibsenian,” “master‐servant girl” and “Thurberian.” As any student of the late James Thurber would recognize at once, this is defined as “husband inhibited in expression of feelings, wife highly expressive.” ... In his chatty newsletter, The Borzoi Quarterly, Alfred A. Knopf puts down the number of copies printed for a handful of his books: Fawn Brodie's life of Joseph Smith, “No Man Knows My History” (1945) 27,000; Conrad Richter's novel, “Light in the Forest” (1953) 43,000; Paul Gallico's “The Snow Goose,” (1941) 261, 000; Walter Benton's “This Is My Beloved” (1945) 480,000; Gilbert Highet's “The Art of Teaching” (1950) 30,000. There also have been 127,000 copies, paperbound, of the latter.

1100-> NEW STRIKE PLAN BARS WALKOUTS; Escrow Clause Calls for Both Sides to Pay Heavily
A new type of collective bargaining agreement that requires employes to continue work while on strike will be signed today by one of the country's best known furniture manufacturers and one of the oldest unions in the industry. The agreement, which also requires continued production in the event of a company lockout, is intended “to take the consumer out of the middle in industrial disputes” while protecting the economic position of both the company and its employes. The agreement is between the Dunbar Furniture Corporation of Berne, Ind.,manufacturers of contemporary design furniture, and the Upholsterers International Union of North America, which has its head‐quarters in Philadelphia. It is scheduled to be signed at 11 A.M. today at the company's offices here at 305 East 63d Street. The signers willbe Harold D.. Sprunger, president of the 47‐year‐old family operated company, and Sal B. Hoffmann, president of the 82‐year‐old union. The agreement provides that when acontract ends and the union and management fail to agree on a new one, production willcontinue. But to pressure both sides to reach anagreement, increasingamounts of wages and matching company funds will be put into a trust over a 12-week period. If there Is no settlement at the end of the 12 weeks, Dunbar and its 275 employes will sur‐ render all the fund to a com‐munity or charity project.Mr. Sprunger and Mr. Hoffmann say they know of no similar provision in any contract any‐where, but that they expect to see many in the future. Should a strike or lockout occur, under the agreement 50 per cent of the workers wages and an equal amount of com‐pany funds are to be placed with an independent referee or bank during the first six weeks. If the strike or walkout is set‐tled in that time, all the money is returned to the employes and the company. If the parties fail to reach an agreement during the next three weeks, the contributions by the company and the employes continue. However, they will get back only75 cent of their money if they settle beforethe ninth week, andthe referee or bank will be paid a small charge. Only 50 per cent of the con‐tributions will be returned if a settlement conies in the next two weeks. The 12th weekhas been termed the“sudden death” week and if the agreement is reached duringthat period, 25 per cent of the contributions will be re‐turned. After the 12th week, none of the money can be re‐ turned. Instead, the fund will be turned over to an association of clergymen in Bernefor their disposal. After the 12-week period, either the company or theunion may go back to the traditional lockout or strike. But unless they give notice of such, the old contract will be automatically renewed for a year. The agreement also provides that all injury and illness in‐surance will continueto be paid to the employes during the first 12 weeks. A spokesman for the union explained that under the new agreement“thecash incentive for both sides to settle in the first six weeks of dispute is almost overwhelming.” The original concept for the “strike‐work” agreement was conceived by the late Lynn W. Beman, who was labor consul‐tant for the National Associa‐tion of Furniture Manufactur‐ers, of which Dunbar is a mem‐ber. The last strike at Dunbar, which lasted six weeks, was five years ago.

1101-> CAPITAL STUNNED; Police Fired to Deter ‘Disorderly Mobs,’ Pentagon Says
WASHINGTON, Friday, Jan. 10—The Defense Department declared early today that Canal Zone police—not Army troops—fired on Panamanian mobs last night “in self‐protection.” The statement, issued at 2 A.M., was the first public comment from a stunned Administration on the rapid deterioration of relations with Panama that developed last evening. The flare‐up presented President Johnson and his new Latin‐American affairs chief, Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Mann, with their first major crisis. The State Department, noting that Panama had suspended diplomatic relations, said it would have no comment until later today, when the basic facts of the situation had been assembled. However, the department asked the Pentagon to collect as much information as it could to help sift fact from rumor. The first reaction of officials was to hope that much of the Panamanian official outrage was intended to assuage nationalistic feelings and that apologies and arrangements could be made later to smooth over the incident. But these officials conceded that they did not yet know the details and dimensions of the situation.

1102-> Pisa Seeking Funds To Reduce the Tilt Of Leaning Tower
PISA, Italy, Feb. 27 (AP)—The city of Pisa has asked the Italian Government to spend more than a million dollars to tilt the Leaning Tower back just a bit. The 14,000‐ton tower would be jacked up six feet and then eased down onto a new concrete base. The object is to keep it from fallinz over. No one wants to straighten the tower; tourists would hardly wish to see a straight Leaning Tower. But the 184‐foot tower already slants almost 11 feet from true perpendicular, and the tilt has increased by a quarter of an inch in 45 years. Experts say that if this goes on, the tower may not stand 100 years more. The tower, in the Piazza def Miracoli, was begun in 1173 when Pisa was a powerful maritime republic, competing with Genoa. When the project was half completed, the soil beneath one side of the base began to sink, and the tower tipped. Construction stopped, and for a century no one could figure out what to do. In 1275 architects decided to resume the work, and the tower was finished in 1284. The little bell tower on ton was added in 1350 The tipping continued, so gradually that it caused no alarm until 1918. Since then, engineers have kept careful measurements. Huge injections of concrete were made in the earth beneath the base on the weak side. But the rate of tilting has gradually increased.

1104-> NEWS NOTES: CLASSROOM AND CAMPUS
Parent‐Teacher Associations for the most part spend considerable time and effort improving and assisting the local school, but the Rosendale P.T.A. of Schenectady, N. Y., has gone a step further. The organization's efforts have made possible the construction of a new school in El Roble, Colombia, and sparked the interest of other schools in initiating similar projects. The idea originated with a member of the organization, Gene Bradley, whose work for the General Electric Company took him to South America. Through contact with the Peace Corps, CARE, and the Alliance for Progress he learned that for a relatively small sum for construction materials and some professional supervision, the nationals in an underdeveloped area could build their own school. With $750 raised by the P.T.A. and the assistance of CARE and two Peace Corps volunteers, Mr. Bradley made arrangements with the local Citizens Committee for Community Action at El Roble, 85 miles northeast of Bogota. Mr. Bradley learned from Sargent Shriver, Peace Corps director, that the mechanism now existed to expand the idea into a program that would oversee the construction of 3,000 such schools around the world. A magazine published by General Electric is acting as a clearing house for information on how similar projects may be started. Address The Forum, c‐o General Electric Company, One River Road, Schenectady 5,N.Y. The Worcester (Mass.) Academy is trying a new approach to the problem of students who do not work up to their ability. A Student Achievement Institute that will concentrate on both academic and personal problems will be held at the prep school for boys for the next five summers. Emphasis will be put on psychological testing and counseling to obtain a true picture of each student's abilities, aptitudes, interests and problems. With this information in hand, students and counselors can work out individual programs to be followed during the sixweek program. Headmaster William S. Piper, who announced the program, noted that it was not designed for students with limited ability, serious emotional or behavior problems or limited interest. One of the qualifications for participation is a willingness to experiment with new approaches to self‐development and to help classmates upon returning to regular school by sharing the summer's experiences. Students between 16 and 18 who have completed their sophomore year at prep school and who have been recommended by their headmasters are eligible to participate in the institute. Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Brandeis University will join forces next September by conducting a week ly seminar for graduate students of both institutions in the fields of city and social welfare planning. The seminar will meet weekly and alternate between the two campuses in Cambridge and Waltham. It will be conducted by Dr. Bernard J. Frieden, assistant professor of city planning at M.I.T., and Dr. Robert Morris, professor of social planning at Brandeis. A major reason for the move is to bring together the two separate but closely related disciplines which have grown out of the many serious problems that plague urban society. Special stress will be given to techniques for dealing with problems arising from urban renewal and relocation of persons displaced by renewal projects. The seminar is the outgrowth of earlier collaboration between the two institutions in a city and regional planning course. At the same time, in an unrelated announcement in the same field, Venezuela has awarded a new contract to the M.I.T.‐Harvard Joint Center for Urban Studies to continue for two years an assistance project in one of the world's largest “new town” developments. The town under development is Santo Tome de Guayana with a population of 60,000 and a projected one of 500,000 within the next 20 years. The center has been taking part in this development since 1961. Students and faculty members from many universities are involved as consultants and researchers. Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash., will begin an experiment in June with an orientation program designed to ease the difficult transition between high school and college. The one‐week “Headstart on College” will test the thesis that preparation for the change can be more effective when offered in the summer lull before the storm than during the confusion of the first week of the fall semester. Students planning to enter any college are eligible to participate in the program. Its goal is to help eliminate the personal problems that cause more dropouts than academic problems among first semester freshmen. Omar L. Olson, director of the program, said that it will include general classes on adjusting to college courses, campus living, selecting majors and other related problems, with small group meetings taking up the more specialized interests of students. Many students acquiring an education for themselves are taking time out to help educate others. One such program is Harvard Undergraduate Teachcrs (HUT), which helps surrounding public schools enrich their curriculums by offering the services of competent Harvard and Radcliffe students. In the process the students acquire stimulating and worthwhile volunteer experience. In addition to documenting its own program, The Volunteer Teacher, published annually by HUT, collects information from colleges having similar programs or projects in the same spirit with somewhat different objectives. Among the colleges listed in the recent compilation are Queens College in New York, the University of Pittsburgh, Columbia University, Yale University, Goddard (Vt.) College, Amherst College and Southern Illinois University. Copies of HUT's 10‐page mimeographed newsletter are available from Harvard Undergraduate Teachers, Phillips Brooks House Association, Cambridge, Mass., 02138.

1105-> NEWS OF THE RIALTO: HILDEGARDE SAYS YES
HILDEGARDE is getting ready to desert the supper‐club circuit. The chanteuse, eyeing the Broadway stage for some time, has found a script to stir her enthusiasm and, unless the astrologer's charts are awry (and lawers disagree), she will be making her debut next spring. The script is Christopher Blake's “Lavalliere” (tentative title); the producer, Charles R. Wood, previously identified as the sponsor of “The Anvil” off Broadway and on Broadway of “God and Kate Murphy.” You don't know who Eve Lavalliere was? She was, Hildegarde says, one of the greatest of French musical stars of another time, who, at the height of her career decided to distribute her wealth and enter a convent. She wasn't permitted to carry out her intentions, at least as far as the convent was concerned — but that's another part of the story. In any event, Hildegarde says, she hopes that her own intentions toward Broadway will not be thwarted. Once before she was theater‐bound, the vehicle, “Packaged in Paris.” That foundered beneath the assaults of sundry evil spirits. “I want very much to get into the theater,” Hildegarde says. “There comes a time for a change, when you become surfeited with what you've been doing. I'm tired of supper clubs. I'm tired of living in hotels. I want to settle down in my apartment in New York.” She's currently at the Statler Hotel in Washington. When that engagement is completed she will return here, possibly to perform at the World's Fair and on a radio program (negotiations are on for both). The aforementioned Mr. Wood, by the way, has another production which is to come out from the wings in the fall. This one, another play by Mr. Blake, is called “Fugue.” It revolves around a Jesuit priest who is a segregationist first and a man of the church second. The play will be directed by Brian Shaw and among the participants are to be Charles Aidman, remembered for his contribution earlier this season to “Spoon River Anthology” (director and actor) and Burt Brinckerhoff, who will be seen in the soon‐tobe‐released film, “The Greatest Story Ever Told.” The pace quickens for the Music Theater of Lincoln Center. With June 8 now set for the beginning of rehearsals for “The King and I,” which will launch the enterprise in the New York State Theater, Richard Rodgers is hopping all over town, looking over dancers and listening to singers. It's taking a lot of looking and listening. Both “The King and I,” opening July 6, and “The Merry Widow,” following on Aug. 17, are going to be among the largest and most sumptuous revivals of these musicals ever undertaken. Mr. Rodgers, who serves the Music Theater as president and producing director (without fee), has three reasons for these ambitions: 1), the stage of the theater is larger than Broadway stages; 2), so is the theater and 3), “because I want these shows to be among the most impressive this city has seen.” Mr. Roger's aims account for the fact that he went after Risé Stevens to play Anna in “The King and I” and Patrice Munsel for Sonia in “The Merry Widow,” both of Metropolitan Opera fame. And, is Mr. Rodgers contemplating any further contributions to Broadway? “I sure am,” he says. Indeed, it turns out that he is involved in earnest negotiations these days which if consummated will see him composing the score for a musical version of Arthur Laurents's “The Time of the Cuckoo.” That's the romantic affair in which Shirley Booth was involved on Broadway and Katharine Hepburn in the film version, “Summertime.” Setting: Venice. Mr. Laurents would do the book and Stephen Sondheim, the lyrics. Off Broadway has a new patron. He is Arthur Cantor, the producer whose previous sorties, on Broadway, have included “The Tenth Man,” “A Thousand Clowns” and “The Passion of Josef D.” It is the man's notion, not unwarranted by the facts, that costs being what they are too many young composers, lyricists and book writers are being deprived of a chance at the pot of gold. Accordingly, he is negotiating for an off‐Broadway playhouse in which he would mount from three to six intimate musicals a year commencing next season. The Music Division of Warner Brothers thinks the man's reasoning is sound and has encouraged Mr. Cantor to the extent of putting up 50 per cent of the total required investment. The Warner Brothers affiliate isn't being simply altruistic. The venture could provide a happy stamping ground for its younger writers, and success would bring in all those juicy residuals—recordings, etc. Mr. Cantor, at this writing, already has decided on at least one property, an adaptation of Feydeau's “Hotel Paradiso.” Tom Meehan, eschewing the version seen on Broadway some seasons back, with Bert Lahr in the main role, has gone to the original script for his book. Philip Springer composed the tunes and Joan Javits, niece of New York's Senator Jacob K. Javits, wrote the lyrics. Associated with Mr. Cantor will be Sante Fe Productions, a firm in which E. E. Fogelson and he are partners. Frederick O'Neal last week became the first Negro president of Actors Equity Association . . . The off‐Broadway musical hit, “The Streets of New York,” instead of closing at the Maidman, will continue its run indefinitely, hoping to profit from the influx of visitors to the World's Fair . . . Tina Sattin has been signed for a major role in Lorraine Hansberry's “The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window,” due in the fall ... Reginald Gardiner, Myles Eason and Marni Nixon will be in the City Center's revival of “My Fair Lady,” opening May 20 for an extended engagement,

1107-> Sidelights; The ‘Dow’ Index Breaks Barrier
The Dow‐Jones industrial average broke through the vaunted “800” barrier for a while yesterday, hit 800.40 and then retreated to close at 796.19, up 1.63 for the day. This was tantamount to the first sub‐four‐minute mile by a runner and John Pennel's topping 17 feet in the pole vault. Like those two records, “800” should soon become the expected base for future tape watching. No one could say exactly when the magic 800.40 figure was reached, since the average remained below 800 at each of its official half‐hourly reporting time. But calculations, based on the highs of each of the 30 issues comprising the average, boosted it over 800. The strength came from airlines, savings and loan associations, cigars, rails and special situations, despite some profittaking that depressed a number of the recent favorites. Total volume reached 4.78 million shares. For the record, the Dow average hit a low of 41.22 on July 8, 1932. Information Lacking American investors in European securities are still finding it difficult to get all the information they desire about their investments. The latest to acknowledge this publicly is the Chemical Fund, a $303 million mutual fund, which eliminated last year its holdings of Chemische Fabrick Van Der Grinten, Zout Ketjen, Zwanenberg Organon and Farbewerke Hoescht, Francis S. Williams, chairman said. These eliminations were in addition to Montecatini, Pechiney and St. Gobain, which were dropped in 1962. Chemic  Mr. Williams said that one of the principal reasons for reducing these holdings was “the difficulty of obtaining as complete and current information on the operations and financial condition of European companies as we are accustomed to obtain on securities of domestic companies.” Silver Takes a Holiday Because silver bullion is shipped across the Atlantic on luxury liners, and since many of these vessels are presently engaged in the cruise trade rather than their regular runs. the price of the metal set a record yesterday on the London market. According to a dispatch by Reuters, the cash price in London rose to 111⅞ pence an ounce (about $1.31) and the three‐month forward delivery quotation rose ⅛ penny, to 111 pence. Meanwhile, silver futures prices here were narrowly mixed in light trading. The rise was said to reflect a larger than usual demand for cash silver in a market short of supplies. However, market sources in London do not expect the tightness to last because of substantial orders placed in New York. But in the meantime, the trade is awaiting the return of the ocean liners to their traditional runs. Plywood Output High Plywood production is booming despite the usual mid‐winter slowdown in home building, the largest market for the material. The Douglas Fir Plywood Association reports that production in the week ended Feb. 8 reached a new high of 219,531,000 square feet, topping the previous record set last December. The new record was equal to about 94 per cent of current industry capacity. The industry's first 200 million‐square‐foot‐week was recorded a year ago. Since then there have been 32 weeks in which production surpassed that level. The industry's flow of new orders indicates further gains in production are in store. New orders in the week ended Feb. 8 were 287,483,000 square feet, 23 per cent more than the industry's present capacity of 234,231,000. Simple Solution An initial sampling of 2,603 companies in 42 states seems to show that independent business should, on its own, be able to solve the national unemployment problem. This was disclosed yesterday with release of a January survey undertaken by the National Federation of Independent Business, Inc. The results showed that 554 companies indicated plans for expanding this year. This would add a total of 2,984 new workers.

1108-> UNION ONCERNED ON TANKER SAFETY; Urges Members Not to Sail Without Assurance
The 12,000‐member International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, is worried about safety conditions on tankers. Its safety committee chairman warned in a statement last week that ship officers would “refuse” to sail on tankers unless they were “completely seaworthy.” The warning by Lloyd W. Sheldon, who also is president of the union's largest unit, Local 88, with 2,000 members, drew a surprised reaction from tanker company operators, who said they were continually studying and implementing improved safety methods. In a letter to all locals of the union along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, Mr. Sheldon urged the members to “search out areas most suspect, which would include excessive speed in fog, overloading, and generally dangerous conditions in the pump rooms.” Report Criticized This week, Mr. Sheldon will enlist the cooperation of other unions in combating what he described as the “attitude of tanker companies” who tend to accept as sufficient precaution the “gas‐freeing” of a tanker after she is discharged of her petroleum products cargo. This is a procedure in which the residue of gases left in emptied tanks is blown out. But studies have shown that even this procedure does not eliminate the risk of explosion. Earlier this month the National Maritime Union assailed a report issued last September by a Federal committee on tanker hazards, Joseph Curran, president of the union, was particularly concerned with the committee's recommendation that tanker operators not be required to gas‐free their empty tanks. The committee had said that closing up a tank after discharge without gas‐freeing it “appears to be an acceptable course.” Mr. Sheldon indicated that he felt the industry was not cooperating with his or other unions in an effort to reduce the hazards of tanker operations. He said he wanted to “sit down, now,” with tanker operators to discuss methods of increasing safety. One method, he said, would be to “water” ballast wing tanks. Mr. Sheldon said he thought this procedure would help reduce the risk of explosion, such as occurred when the tanker Mission San Francisco exploded after she collided with the freighter Elna II in 1957, resulting in the loss of 10 crew members. $3.8 Million Awarded A United States District judge in Delaware ruled that any company operating a tanker that had not been gasfreed and exploded might face unlimited damage suits. Damage verdicts resulted in an award of $3.8 million. “The deterrent to more concentrated effort toward tanker safety by the tanker operators may be the cost of broader safety programs.” Mr. Sheldon remarked. He said the cost of water ballast for the conventional T‐2 tanker, a 16,000 deadweightton vessel would be about $150 an hour and that the water ballasting would require about nine hours of work. He said his union was represented on about 350 tankers. “When Judge [D. J. Layton, who ruled in the Mission San Francisco explosion] announced his decision he put his finger on the issue,” Mr. Sheldon declared, adding: “He said that time was money in business but such considerations played no part where human lives were concerned.” This was a reference to defense arguments that gas‐freeing the Mission San Francisco had been omitted in order to save time.

1111-> UNIONS REAFFIRM WHEAT‐CARGO BAN; Meany Hopeful on Solution ‐U.S. Ship at Odessa
BAL HARBOUR, Fla., Feb. 21—Longshoremen at Gulf and Atlantic ports reaffirmed today their ban on loading wheat bound for the Soviet Union. Thomas Gleason, president of the International Longshoremen's Association, said the boycott was continuing and that the loading of eight grain ships had been stopped since Monday. However, George Meany, president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, said he was encouraged about prospects for settling the weeklong dispute. Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz, and Assistant Secretary of Labor James J. Reynolds continued their efforts to Work out an arrangement to satisfy the longshoremen's demand that 50 per cent of the wheat be shipped in American vessels. Mr. Meany said a solution was possible and that he was hopeful it could achieved soon. Through the week, however, optimistic statements by labor and Government officials have been followed by new snags in the confused situation. The longshoremen contend the Government has failed to enforce a promise made by President Kennedy that at least 50 per cent of the wheat sold to the Soviet Union would be carried by United States‐flag ships. The longshoremen are supported by the Seafarer's International Union, the National Maritime Union and other maritime labor organizations. The Continental Grain Company, which has sold one million tons of wheat to the Soviet Union, received a waiver from the Maritime Administration last week, permitting it to ship only 38 per cent of the wheat in American vessels.

Botulism is the least common but mmost highly fatal type of food poisoning. It is caused by the toxin produced by the botulinum organism found in food inadquately processed or preserved. The announcement said a small supply of therapeutic antitoxin had been purchased by the service's Communicable Disease Center from the Danish State Serum Institute. It will be stored in Atlanta for emergency use by physicians, hospitals, or health departments. The center will be on 24‐hour duty for calls for the antitoxin.

1116-> Aqueduct Season Gets Off to a Record Start as 48,153 Wager $4,056,913
A throng of 48,153 hungry­for‐action customers welcomed the return of thoroughbred racing to Aqueduct yesterday. The largest week‐day opening‐day crowd in New York's racing history turned out to bet—and they did handsomely. The players sent $4,056,913, a record, into the pari‐mutuel machines, eclipsing the pre­vious week day mark of $3,853,- 138 set two years ago. The fact that it was established on a program that lacked a fa­mous stakes event as the mainattraction made the wagering total all the more noteworthy.The feature race was an over­night handicap for fillies and mares, and was won by Mrs. Marion Frankel's Charspiv. The day's activities started season that will be the longest ever in this state, comprising 234 racing days that will extend through Dec. 12. All of these except the 24 days at Saratoga in August will take place at Aqueduct. Last year's campaign ran from March 20 through Dec.7. Fair weather—cloudless skies and a brisk breeze and the per­formances on the fast track combined to stimulate the fans through most of the afternoon. Enthusiasm flagged a little as the afternoon progressed and the weather became cooler. Racing at the major tracks in the state is operated by the New York Racing Association, a private organization conduct­ed on a nonprofit basis Last year $66,648,281 was contrib­uted in taxes to the state Treas­ury from the 10 per cent of the pari‐mutuel handle. The N.Y.R.A. received 5 per cent, most of which goes back into purses and maintenance James Cox Brady, the chair­man of the 20‐man board of rustees of the N.Y.R.A., said he was completely pleased with the big turnout, and predicted a most successful local cam­paign. “Actually, the crowd is no surprise to, me,” said Brady. “It's the same story all the time. Give the public good rac­ing, and the fans will come out and bet. The best purses make the best races and will try to give the public what it wants.” The racing was satisfactory enough to please most turf aficionados, with favorites win­ning four of the nine races. Charspiv was one of these as she scored by two lengths over Bart Martin's Chophouse in a six‐furlong sprint. Bob Ussery, the leading rider of the 1963 New York campaign, was on Charspiv, and he kept her in front all the way for a return of $5.30 for $2 to win. ner time was 1:10 3‐5 under 148 pounds. Johnny Rotz was the riding star, with three winners, in­cluding Tri‐Quest, the $8.30 winner of the second half of a daily double of $96.50. An impressive performance was turned in by Herbert Al­len's Determined Man in the third race, a six‐furlong event. Leading entering the stretch, Determined Man was “headed” by Consecrate but rallied under the urging of Ussery to win by The Iong‐shot players were excited when Shavetail and Solid Glory wound up in a photo finish in the eighth race. Shavetail, with Wayne Cham­ber up, was declared the win­ner at $12. Solid Glory, ridden by Pete Moreno, went off at $107.90 to $1 and paid $70.40 for place. A hunch bet didn’t attract many players in the fourth race, and as things turned out, it was just as well. Even with St. Pat­rick's Day only a day away, Irish Relic in the fourth race went off at the big price of 45 to 1. The 4‐year‐old son of Iam­arelie and Irish, Nest by Irish Stew got off awkwardly and wound up in seventh place. For­eign Land, with Rotz riding, was the winner, by five lengths over the favored Carroll Coun­ty. The first handicap stakes race of the season, the Paumonok, will be run on Saturday, and Tommy Trotter, the N.Y.R.A. racing secretary, released the weights yesterday. Ahoy of the Jaclyn Stable will carry the top burden of 126 pounds. Joseph Roebling's Rainy Lake is next at 121. The first stakes race on the calendar will be the swift for 3‐year‐olds. It will be run on Friday, at six furlongs, the same distance as the Paumonok. The largest opening day crowd in New York history was 56,115 on Saturday, April 6, 1946, at Jamaica. The betting on that day was $3,412,885. The record crowd was the 70,992 on May 30, 1960. This vast as­semblage bet the record sum of $5,560,628. The first winner of the sea­son was Larry Adams, who scored: with Pitt at $11.10. Adams also won the first race on opening day of 1963.

1121-> Man in the News; Golf's Finest ShowpieceArnold Palmer
OR most professional golfers, their sport is a contest of skill—man vs. man and man vs. the elements. It is a livelihood. And it is hard work. For Arnold Palmer, it is all these and also a perpetual challenge. Palmer met the latest challenge yesterday by becoming the first four‐ time winner of the Masters tournament, among the most prestigious in golf. He has met so many chal‐ lenges so well that he has become a universal hero in the sport, and the first to aproach a millionaire's status from off‐course sidelines. Bobby Jones was a hero, but golf was a rich man's game in his day and the public placed him on a pedestal. Ben Hogan was a hero, but public respect turned to warmth only after his nearfatal automobile accident. Palmer is a hero to all, the darling of an era in which television has put golf into millions of homes. The man on the street finds a sense of identification with him. He can't play golf the way Palmer does. Who can? But he discovers a little of himself in this athlete of athletes. This association turns into hero worship, and the recruit becomes a happy addition to Arnie's Army, the excitable, dedicated and king‐sized gallery that tramps after Palmer whenever he plays. How did Palmer become such a Pied Piper? He doesnot have Jones's stylish strokes. He doesn't have Hogan's mechanical gifts. His game is based on power, not finesse. But he does have boldness, which breeds fallibility, the curse of every Sunday duffer. To Palmer every shot is a challenge. As one observer put it, “Palmer plays golf the way most people shoot craps.” He never plays safe. He plays dynamic, emotional, exciting, unpredictable golf. He charges down the fairway, almost running to make his next shot, and thousands of Walter Mittys rush with him Jerry Barber, a leading pro, once said: “Palmer goes right to the throat of a course, and then he shakes it to death.” But “go‐for‐broke” golf has pitfalls, too. Palmer once took a 12 on a hole, and everyone who has had trouble in breaking 90 felt a little closer to him. With his success Palmer retains the common touch. He chats with everyone. He flies his plane from one tournament to another. Once he detoured hundreds of miles to give a stranded serviceman he didn't know a ride home to visit an ailing parent. Palmer is 34 years old, 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 183. He has a tanned, handsome face, with a winning smile. He has the forearms, shoulders and back of a blacksmith, but he tapers to a 32‐inch waist. His light brown hair is receding. He was a chain smoker until January, when he quit smoking entirely. He quit endorsing cigarettes, too, but still lends his name to sports clothing and golf equipment, soda pop, catchup, laundry and maid service. He has interests in about 27 corporations—he isn't sure of the number. There are so many corporations that he formed an insurance company just to collect their premiums. He earns $400,000 to $500,000 a year from golf and business. Palmer was born Sept. 10, 1929, in Latrobe, Pa. He was the eldest of four children (two boys and two girls) and the only golfer in the foursome. Milfred J. (Deacon) Palmer, his father, has been greenkeeper since 1921 and head pro since 1933 at the Latrobe Country Club. At the age of 3, Palmer got a set of sawed‐off clubs. At 7, he broke 55 for nine holes and at 12, he broke 40. At 14, in his first high school match, he shot a 71. He entered Wake Forest College on .a golf scholarship in 1947, left for a three‐year hitch in the Coast Guard, returned in 1954 and quit just short of a degree. In 1954 he won the United States Amateur championship. That year he met Winifred Walzer, a quiet, attractive brunette from Bethlehem, Pa. Palmer, bold even in those days, proposed three days after having met her. They were married that winter. They have two daughters, Peggy, 8, and Amy, 5, and a ranch house overlooking the Latrobe course. They are seldom home. Winnie travels with her husband and acts as his social secretary. Palmer likes to experiment in designing golf clubs. He plays bridge, is mechanically inclined and says he has a beginner's interest in art. Since turning professional in 1955, Palmer has won the United States Open (1960); British Open (1961 and 1962); Masters (1958, 1960. 1962 and 1964); $128,230 in official tournament purses in one year (1963) and more than $500,000 in career tournament earnings. He has also captivated the public perhaps as no other athlete since Babe Ruth or Jack Dempsey. He is golf's finest showpiece. “I guess I'm like all golfers,” Palmer once said. “I don't make many shots I really like.”

1122-> Life in Composograph; THE NEW YORK GRAPHIC The World's Zaniest Newspaper. By Lester Cohen. Illustrated 233 pp. Philadelphia: Chilton Books. $5.95.
FOR eight improbable years, from 1924 to 1932, The New York Evening Graphic (lovingly known to its critics as the “Porno‐Graphic”), flourished on the stands in desperate competition with Captain Patterson's Daily News and Hearst's Mirror. It was not a true competitor in the burgeoning tabloid field—but a livmg demonstration that successful magazine publishers usually are incapable of creatiag aood newspapers. The Graphic had a normally interesting specialty—sea. Bernarr Macfadden, then at the beginning of his career as a cultist publisher, was also pro‐ prietor of Physical Culture magazine (health) and True Story (prurience, disguised as uplift). Thus The Graphic was filled with glowing esamples of the Body Beautiful. At the same time, it tore from the daily Book of Life in New York some of its most sordid and titillating pages. The staff Macfadden assembled to accomplish these ends is — in this volume — a melancholy roll‐call of once‐noted personalities. Emile Gauvreau was managing editor. Fulton Oursler was the publisher's chief aide.Walter Winchell was beginning his night life and Ed Sullivan was slouching about the sports department. Mr. Cohen himself was contest editor. This was an important job since the paper lived by con tests of every conceivable kind. New York life in the twenties suited The Graphic's style, but Macfaddea improved on life itself wherever possible. He was not content with the Hall‐Mills murder, or Gerald Chapman's hanging, or the antics of Daddy and “Peaches” Browning, or the sensational Alice Kip Rhinelander divorce case. With con‐summate bad taste, he enhanced these events with something called the Composograph, a paste job of real and posed pictures, combined with none‐toosubtle “art” work, resulting in scenes unlikely ever to be photographed. These pictures were part of the daily salmagundi of leg art, reader participation and pure corn of every variety that The Graphic served its audience. If it had been told with some grace and wit, The Graphic's story might have been amusing and mildly instructive to students of human behavior. It is unfortunate that the late Lester Cohen, a successful novelist and screenwriter, chose to record it in prose which approximates the paper's own appalling style. Six pages of pictures are little more than a nostalgic of what the book might have been.

1125-> APARTMENT RENTING FOR BUSINESS TESTED
A Florida deveIoper is offering to lease Miami apartments on a test basis to corporations that normally rent hotel suites for employes engaged in sales promotions. Paul Dennis, president of the Paul Dennis Organization here, said the cost of maintaining hotel rooms and suites for company representatives had caused several corporations to take a harder look at their budgets. Renting apartments, he says, has the added advantage of improving the traveling businessman's moraIe, as he can take, his family with him on long sales promotions. Mr. Dennis said large business dinners, meetings and parties, which are normally held in expensive restaurants, were another expense that could be reduced by leasing an apartment. Entertaining at home, he pointed out, has become popular with many businessmen. Corporate officials are entertaining at home to remian within the busi ness expense limits prescribed by the Department of Internal Revenue. Mr. Dennis is the developer of, the Point of View North apartment house in Miami. Rents range from $130 a month for one‐bedroom apartments to $451 a month for two‐bedroom duplex apartments.

1126-> HOLLYWOOD ‘MURDER’; Or, Hints on Homicide By Jack Lemmon
JACK Lemmon, the most frequently mugged member of Hollywood's only legalized Murder Incorporated, was trying to explain the allocation of “territories,” among himself and his two partners in their picture, “How to Murder Your Wife.” At the moment, one of the partners, Richard Quine, was developing a sweat trying to set up a scene in a steam room at the Paramount Studio. The other partner, George Axelrod, the only writer with golden monograms on the tops of English‐made moccasins, was contemplating simple assault on his original script for the movie. So far, said Mr. Lemmon, through a veil of smoke, the name of their merged company has not reflected disharmony within the ranks. the subject of the movie. When the camera was turning, he declared, Mr. Quine was absolute boss. Periodically, the three got together on ideas for introducing more humor into the homicidal aspects and more hysteria into the laughter. “We are all pros and when pros work together they can thrash out problems intelligently.” He seemed to have put aside Hollywood's great store of tales of conflict between star and director; between director and writer. From the very beginning, Mr. Lemmon recalled, Murder Incorporated was a model of civilized harmony. The idea for “How to Murder Your Wife,” originated with Mr. Axelrod. He outlined to Mr. Lemmon the story of a comic strip artist who tries to enact as much as possible of each strip before putting it on paper. Since the strips deal with the adventures in crime, the comic artist sometimes works out phony murders. Comes a day when the artist (Mr. Lemmon), after a night of celebrating, finds that he has married a beautiful woman (Virna Lisi), he does not know and does not particularly like. His comic strip then begins a serial about wifemurder. And his wife vanishes. That was as much of the plot as Mr. Lemmon thought, in allfairness, should be made available to the public at this time. “I loved the idea,” said Mr. Lemmon, coughing delicately through his cigarette smoke. “I like George's writing. About the same time we began talking with Dick (Quine).” He paused. “Maybe George had already talked to Dick. I don't remember. Anyhow, we each had a company.” So papers were filed to bring Murder Incorporated within the law. Mr. Lemmon said he had, like other stars, used his own company in some of .his earlier 20 pictures since he came to Hollywood in 1 953. In “Days of Wine and Roses,” for instance, he had his company and Martin Manulis, the producer, also had a company. “I have learned as an actor,” said Mr. Lemmon, “that I can be of value in appraising a script. Sometimes what looks good on paper may not play well. I can make suggestions about playability. But once we're on the floor no one interferes with Quine's authority. On the floor he is boss. Only bad directors refuse to listen to any suggestions from actors.” Between rehearsals and shooting on the set, Mr. Lemmon returned to his dressing room and confessed that he has begun plotting to try his hand as a director in some future movie. “But not with myself in the picture,” he added hurriedly. “Directing is more creative than acting. The director is calling the shot. The actor's work is mostly interpretive. I have been finding out as an actor that I think more and more as a director. I'm not saying I want to abandon acting. I just want to try directing. Possibly, if some idiot gives me a chance I'll do it soon. Of course, the writer is the most creative of all. Or at least he should be. No. I'm not planning to become a writer. The only thing I write is songs.” Mr. Lemmon, who does not read music, enjoys playing the piano by ear. He has written between 20 and 30 songs. A couple have been published. “I suppose I can call myself a professional song writer. I have made a total of about $78. I remember when I first went to New York from college I had planned to save the theater from the decline of American music since the death of George Gershwin. I also wanted to save the American theater.” Almost sheepishly, Mr. Lemmon reflected on his efforts to elevate the theater as the star of one of the resounding Broadway flops of cent years, “Face of a Hero.” He has not abandoned hope for Broadway. however. For Mr. Lemmon still plans to do more plays, though he has not been reading any play scripts lately. His movie commitments, he explained, tie him up for the next two years.

1128-> Maltese Learn to Weave Finnish Rugs; Results Are Exported to New York by a Danish Concern
HE same reverence in the face of beauty that once prodded Dutch burghers to spread their prized oriental carpets over the dining table instead of the floor is being reaffirmed in our more affluent society. Some modern homemakers, unable to bear the thought of ruffling the expensive pile on their rya or rya‐like rugs preserve such purchases in the immaculate state by lhanging them on the wall. With a knowing wink at the rugs‐on‐the‐vertical trend, Mediterranean Industries (a British company) and Tadel Beutlich (a trained rya artist) joined forces on the island of Malta to produce “Rya Tapestries.” Distributed by UnikaVaev, a Danish rug and fabric company, the results are on the third floor of Georg Jensen. Rya Tapestries.is a misnomer if each of the words is precisely defined. A rya traditionally is a one‐of‐a‐kind long‐pile wool rug woven by the same artist who creates the design and chooses the colors. A tapestry is handwoven in a traditional tapestry stitch and the pattern appears the same on both sides. Palle Lorentzen, president of Unika‐Vaev, explained that “the pieces from Malta are called rya because they are handwoven of Finnish rya yarn and tapestries because most people want to hang them on the walls as art.” Mr. Lorentzen explained the history of the Maltese experiment while leading an informal inspection of the lush tapestries on a recent morning at Jensen's. “The British colony of Malta, which is anticipating independence around the 30th of May, was desperately searching for new industry to bring badly needed capital and jobs to the island,” Mr. Lorentzen said. “With a tradition of home weaving already established among the women of Malta, a craft venture, such as rug weaving, seemed a natural start.” Intrigued by the idea of commissioning original rug designs from outstanding European artists, a group of British investors financed the formation of a company on Malta called Mediterranean Industries. The group leased space, set up looms and imported an artist proficient in rya rug‐making to instruct the local weavers. Production is limited to editions of 50 and no more than one or two pieces of each design are exported to any given country. Mr. Lorentzen pointed out that all the tapestries carried pedigrees on their backs. He turned one over to reveal a neat gray fabric tag, about the size of a paperback book, with this embroidered legend: “Summer, Rya Tapestry designed by Tadek Beutlich, woven by Carmen Camillero, 2/50.” In the pilot group of tapestries, which were exhibited in London before coming to Jensen's, only three artists are represented: Mr. Beutlich, LeenaKaisa Halme and the late Jean Cocteau. Polish‐born Mr. Beutlich, who teaches in London, went to Malta to indoctrinate the local people in the intricacies of the rya technique. His designs borrow color schemes and inspiration from nature, as “Summer,” “Autumn” and “Sunset” suggest. Miss Halme, a prodigy from Helsinki who was a teacher of rya by the time she was 19 years old, demonstrated her expertise and familiarity with the medium by her choice of abstract patterns and glowing, jewel‐like colors. On the other hand, Jean Cocteau, the French writer and painter, showed his unfamiliarity with the rug medium by creating designs that become slightly distorted rather than enhanced by the depth of pile. His colors, which vibrate in combinations of turquoise, green and yellow, contrast markedly with the more subtle tonal counterpoints of the trained rya artists. Each Rya Tapestry, which measures approximately 6 by 4 feet (sizes can vary by as much as eight inches), has a loopedover border into which a wooden rod can be inserted for hanging. The price for the five Beutlich tapestries and three Halme tapestries is $850 each;the two Cocteau pieces are $950 each.

RIO DE JANEIRO, May 11 —Argentina has protested the proposed increased sale of United States surplus wheat to Brazil to fill the quota of 600,000 tons that the Soviet Union is unable to deliver this year. Brazil now is negotiating with the United States for a total of 900,000 tons in addition to 1.2 million tons purchased earlier for delivery through the end of this year under the Public Law 480 surplus commodity disposal law. In addition to the failure of the Russians to deliver their wheat quota, Brazil's own crop suffered a loss due to climatic conditions.

1131-> Economy Views Shift; Doubts Arise That Expansion Will Remain Free of Inflation Pressure
Business economists and those working for the Johnson Administration no longer agree on the outlook for the economy. The Administration's economists, and the President himself, express confidence that the expansion in business activity will continue to roll along free of inflationary pressures. Their forecast is for an upturn that remains short of boom proportions. Economists in banks and business organizations had shared this view, but many have been subject to growing doubts. They now think that a full‐fledged boom may be in the making, which would be followed by a downturn. There is as yet no tangible evidence of a boom—or of serious inflationary pressures—that would call for a tighter monetary policy. Those who are talking in boom terms admit that it is at least three to six months away, and might not emerge until 1965. But the shift in the thinking of economists is significant. Until recently, they have been cautious, if not actually pessimistic, about the prospects for a further rise in economic activity. Last September, for instance, the annual poll taken by the National Association of Business Economists showed that 18 per cent predicted a decline in business for 1964. The majority then forecast a relatively modest rise in gross national product from $585 biilion in 1963 to $607 billion in 1964. This increase was based on the assumption that tax reductions would be between $4 billion and $5 billion. Economists began raising their sights as business activity in 1963's last quarter exceeded their expectations; and when Mr. Johnson reshaped the taxreduction bill, increasing its size and packing more of its punch into the currentyear, they made fresh upward adjustments in their forecasts. Thus, in January, at the time that the President's Council of Economic Advisers unveiled its prediction that gross national product would touch around $623 billion for the year, the revised consensus was close to that figure. But while the C.E.A. has stood pat, many economists have been busy making further revisions. Tilford C. Gaines, vice president of the First National Bank of Chicago, is one who has joined the boom camp. He observed last week that “what has thus far been an orderly business expansion will probably develop boom symptoms within the next few months,” triggered by “a boom psychology among businessmen and consumers.” Mr. Gaines thinks that the current rise may lure businessmen into the old trap of overestimating the potential growth of the Market for their products, leading them to expand capacity at a rate and to a degree that would eventuallyprove to have been excessive. Simultaneously, boom psychology could lead businessmen to stockpile inventories, either in anticipation of boom sales levels or in fear of price inflation.” A boom psychology has not developed as yet, but other economists who note that the ingredients of a potential boom are nowpresent. A symposium published in the Spring newsletter of the National Association of Business Economists reveals some of the danger signs seen by economists. Commenting on government finances, Morris Cohen, associate economist of Fortune, notes that the tax cut is bigger than the $11.5 billion estimated by the Administration. He puts its size at over $13 billion and argues that it “is introducing a destabilizing force” that could produce shocks to the economy in 1965. Douglas Greenwald of McGraw‐Hill, dealing with the impact of tax reductions on capital spending, reports that “pressure on capacity has already developed in the auto industry, especially in components, in textiles, in oil, in papers, and in some lines of chemicals.” He thinks that a rising level of consumer demand “could result in important bottlenecks arising soon in many production fields.” Edmund A. Mennis, vice president of Wellington Management Company, comments that “it seems doubtful that most corporations will willingly pass on the benefits of the tax cuts in the form of lower prices.” And William F. Butler, vice president of the Chase Manhattan Bank, predicts that gross national product will be running at a rate of $640 billion in the second half, which will pose “a problem of containing inflationary pressures later in the year.” According to Mr. Butler, the economy will be operating at close to “practical capacity” in the second half. He thinksthat this state of affairs will place significant pressure on prices and could mean a tightening in the labor market “to support wage increases in excess of the gain in productivity.” It seems clear that there is a danger that a boom cr inflationary psychology will take hold. The Administration can state that the availability of labor and plant capacity is ample protection against price increases, but it is asking for trouble by urging businessmen and consumers to spend all of the increase in purchasing power provided by tax reductions. For if this happened, it could result in the destabilizing boom forecast by economists. So far, though, economists appear to be the only ones afflicted with a boom or inflationary psychology. If businessmen and consumers heed their new warnings, the boom and the ensuing bust may be avoided.

1132-> A Reader's Report
HERE are two parallel themes in (Sloane, $4.95), a more than usually subtle novel of Arctic adventure by John Harris. One is the struggle of eight men to survive on the Greenland ice cap after most of their equipment has been destroyed by fire. The other is the battle of their base‐camp commander, an explorer named Tom Fife, to cut through public apa‐thy and red tape back in London and raise the necessary funds for a rescue operation. “The unforgiving wind” of public opinion makes Fife's job a heart breaker, since he is blamed for a mishap caused by the negligence of the expedition's dead commander. As almost every Arctic misadventure imaginable befalls the survivors, Fife himself suffers a long list of civilian indignities. He is shunted aside by the financiers of the expedition, who feel a mercy mission is a poor investment, and snubbed by politicians who seek to avoid unfavorable publicity. International politics the midst of the trawler war between England and Iceland) and the quasimilitary nature of the expedition bog down matters further. Fife's eventual victory over both the Arctic and “all the smooth people who had doubted him” comes as the fitting climax to a first‐rate story. John Christopher, an English novelist with a flair for the bizarre, has a nice new grisly entry in  (Simon & Schuster, $4.50). The scene opens, as it did so often in 19th‐century adventure fiction, in a luxurious London town house in the dead of winter, where, as the champagne is poured and the caviar eaten, our host unveils the raison d’çtre of the next couple of hundred pages. What our host—who is named Sweeney—proposes is that his guests sail with him from Honolulu aboard a chartered yacht to some of the Pacific islands. Now if a winter cruise to the Marquesas were all that was in prospect, Sweeney's voyage would not merit even a page in The National Geographic. But these are the nineteensixties, where even an adventure story can be a trifle sick, and when you find out what Sweeney has in mind for his innocent tourists—a half‐dozen Mayfairites — you will understand why he has been intentionally vague about the itinerary. Marooned on a desolate Pacific island, the yacht's passengers take part in a sick version of “The Admirable Crichton,” for reasons that would be pretty ludicrous except that Mr. Christopher is such a good story teller. If the folks who run the diplomatic show in William Merrick's (Holt, Rinehart & Winston, $4.95) are anything like the real thing, the safest course for the U S. A. is to pull back into isolationism and trust in a Fortress America. Mark Cannon, presented by the—author as a bright young man, is a minister assigned to a North African kingdom that is nameless but familiar. Feeling that the country is about to fall under the control of a Communist terrorist named Ben‐Sakah, Cannon, persuades his government to sponsor a Putsch led by a Colonel Bachai, an old partisan tiger, who has written a monograph on Thomas Jefferson and is friendly to Western ideals. Cannon's enthusiasm for Bachai extends to his svelte Italian wife, Gianna, and the young diplomat evidently was not taught by the State Department that supplying heavy artillery to a cuckolded husband is a shortsighted tactic. The political and emotional scene is further complicated by the local C.I.A. stringer, a cad who, oddly enough, opposes this particular coup d’état, but fancies Cannon's rich, spoiled wife, Betty. Such a mixture of motives can only end in the destruction of the United States Information Service building by a street mob and in sundry damage to American prestige. Mr. Merrick's solid description of political forces at logger‐ heads is more credible than the actions of his characters. (McGraw‐Hill, $4.95), a manned lunar shot invented by Hank Searli is made unnecessarily chancy when political motives dominate a scientific operation. First a young civilian replaces a more experienced military man to gratify world opinion. Secondly, the project itself is launched with undue haste to compete with a Russian voyage already under way. But nothing—neither the fear of being hit by meteorites, nor his alcoholic wife, nor the quite small chance of survival once he gets to the moon— is able to stay astronaut Steven Lawrence from his appointed mission Mr. Searle has the makings of a good adventure novel here, but it would have profited from a tidier narrative.

1133-> CAUSES OF DEATH STUDIED BY W.H.O.; Heart Disease and Cancer Heart Ills and Cancer Top
GENEVA, April 29—Cardiovascular diseases and cancer are the leading causes of death in affluent societies, as against infectious diseases in poorer countries, and everywhere accidents kill more people up to the age of 45 than does disease. These are the conclusions emerging from two studies carried out by the World Health Organization and reported in its epidemiogical and vital statistics publication. The first study, dealing with the 10 main causes of death in 22 selected countires and territories in North America, Europe and Oceania, shows that in the period of review, 1954–56, 1960 and 1961, heart diseases came first in all 22, cancer second, in 19, strokes third, 19, accidents fourth, 14, and influenza and pneumonia fifth. Those categories together accounted for 70 per cent of all deaths. Heart disease alone was responsible for 31 per cent of deaths in those countries in 1961; if strokes, causing 13 per cent, were added, cardiovascular diseases caused more than 44 per cent of all deaths. In the 15 to 44 age group, accidents, cancer, heart disease and suicide nearly everywhere shared the first four places. Between 45 and 64, the accident rate was no longer highest and cancer moved into first place, responsible for about 30 per cent of all deaths. In the countries where cancer was not first — Canada, the United States, Finland, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Australia and New Zealand—heart disease was first and cancer second. At 65 and over heart disease was the most important cause of death in each of the 22 countries and territories, responsible for about 36 per cent of the total in 1961. Strokes were in general the second leading cause of death in this age group, averaging 17 per cent. In 1961 these two categories of cardiovascular diseases caused more than half the deaths. Cancer was third in 14 of the countries and second in the remainder. There was a tendency for the average death rate from cancer to increase. The second study dealt with the 10 leading causes of death in 12 countries in Africa, South and Central America and Asia in the same years. Infectious diseases constituted the leading cause of death, but there were greater variations from country to country than in more developed regions. For example, gastric and intestinal diseases caused more deaths than any other category but represented only about 9 per cent of the total and led the list in only six countries. Influenza, pneumonia, heart disease, cancer, accidents and the infections of childhood were also high but in no consistent pattern. Between the ages of 15 and 44, accidents headed the list, causing 15 per cent of all deaths. Between 45 and 64, causes of death in the two groups of countries were most nearly approximate. In the group of 12, heart disease, cancer and strokes were the most lethal. Accidents lost some of their importance and only in Japan was suicide among the first 10 causes ofdeath. Even at 65 and over in the lesser developed countries heart disease was the principal cause of death. However, the figures represent only 15 per cent of the total. Cancer came second in 1960, responsible for 8 per cent.

1134-> APRIL BOND SALES AT 6‐MONTH HIGH; Offerings Were 20% Below Those in 1963 Month
Public bond offerings in April rose to a six‐month high of $1,415,700,000, a survey made by the New York Times revealed yesterday.Public bond offerings totaled $1,620,200,000 last October. The value of industrial bond issues offered to the market during April fell to $56.9 million, from $497 million in the 1963 month, but the total advanced by 20.3 per cent from $47.3 million in March. The level fell below offerings of $1,782,412,000 in the 1963 month by 20.5 per cent, but exceeded by 24.9 per cent public placements totaling $1,133,000,000 in March. Initial offerings of state and municipal bond issues advanced by 67 per cent in April, to $1,020,000,000 from $611,912,000 in the month a year ago, and by 40.7 per cent over placements worth $725 million in March. The value of public utility bonds offered to investors during the month fell sharply to $233 million, from $536 million in April, 1963. The margin over the March total of $126 million was 20.3 per cent. Primary offerings of railroad bond issues rose by 48.1 per cent to $42.5 million in April, from $28.7 million in March. No such bond issues came to market in the period a year ago. Miscellaneous bond issues publicly offered to investors in April totaled $53.3 million. This compares with $57.5 million in the month a year ago and with 156 million in March. Public stock offerings in April fell by 30.7 per cent to $120,214,520 on 33 issues from $173,547,500 on 10 issues in the 1963 month, and by 12 per Cent from $136,577,796 on 26 issues in March. The largest public stock offering in the month was the $17,586,000 Texas Utilities Company's sale of 300,000 shares at $58.62 a share.

1135-> Hopes for Kashmir
After another futile debate over the perennial issue of Kashmir, the United Nations Security Council has again appealed to India and Pakistan to settle their dispute by direct negotiations and meanwhile to exercise utmost restraint to avoid more violence. Under the circumstances, that is the most the Council could do. Any attempt to play a more positive role, to reaffirm its past demands for a plebiscite, even to enlist the mediation of Sec‐retary General Thant, is doomed by Indian and Russian opposition. Any hope for a settlement must rest, therefore, on direct negotiations. Fortunately, such negotiations now appear to offer greater promise than in the past, with Sheik Abdullah, the leader of the Kashmiri, playing a major role. He has conferred with Prime Minister Nehru, who anticipates a new Chinese Communist assault and seeks both to bolster India's defenses and to eliminate what is now its second front against Pakistan. Sheik Abdullah now confers with President Ayub Khan of Pakistan, who has made his peace with Communist China but also seeks to end the Kashmir dispute to safeguard that peace. Behind their verbal show of strength and de‐termination, both sides appear to be searching for formulas to end their quarrel without loss of face. This search is facilitated by Sheik Ab‐dullah's expressed conviction that the status of Kashmir is less important than good relations between India and Pakistan. The farthest‐reaching formula under discussion is an independent Kashmir within a joint defense pact with India and Pakistan looking toward confederation. An alternative formula calls for an Indian‐Pakistani condominium for Kashmir, also based on a joint dafense pact long favored by both Indian and Pakistani military leaders. These formulas would avoid the stumbling block of a plebiscite, to which India objects, and which would handicap a third proposal for a U.N. trustteeship for Kashmir ending in a plebiscite. All these formulas still arouse deterwined opposition of both rightist and leftist elements in India, but there does seem to be a glimmer of hope on the horizon where none existed before.

1136-> Caution Advised for Inlets
An inlet is a break in the contour of the shore line through which water connecting the ocean with a bay or inside waterway must pass in the course of a tidal cycle. It normally has a swift current except near maximum flood or maximum ebb tide. Particular caution should be exercised when negotiating an inlet.

1137-> Anti‐Smoking Drive in Illinois
CHICAGO, Jan. 12 (UPI)—The Illinois State Medical Society decided today to plan a “continuing and aggressive” education drive to discourage young people from smoking. The society's board of trustees said the program would be “designed to prevent children from starting the smoking habit and to influence teenagers who are smokers to discontinue the habit.”

1138-> Man in the News; A Politician by Birth; Jonathan Brewster Bingham
ONATHAN BREWSTER BINGHAM, who is trying to retire Charles A. Buckley of the Bronx from the House of Representatives, was born to politics but not to the politician's manner. His father, the late Hiram Bingham, was a Republican Governor of Connecticut and then a United States Senator, and Jonathan Bingham conceived early in life a yearning for elective office. His race against Mr. Buckley for the House seat in the 23d Congressional District, which began officially yesterday with the opening of his headquarters, is his second at‐tempt to satisfy that yearning. The leaders of the reform movement who chose him as their candidate were attracted by his education, his record of successful state and Federal service, his earnestness, and his patrician appearance. “I went for Jack Bingham,” one of them said yesterday, “because I think he's a man who can do something more than say how terrible Charlie Buckley is. He can offer a positive alternative.” Yet his lack of the politician's touch—his aloofness, one friend calls it—has many professionals worried. They wonder whether he will be able to excite enough rankand‐file Democrats to defeat Mr. Buckley in the primary June 2. Mr. Buckley has contributed to this picture. “If I had to pick an opponent,” he said recently, “I'd pick Bingham. He's just a stiff.” Jonathan Bingham has made a career of excelling. At Groton, he recorded the highest academic average in the school's history. His record stood for four years. It was eclipsed by McGeorge Bundy, now Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. In a distinguished class at Yale (August Heckscher, John Hersey, Brendan Gill and Whitelaw Reid were classmates and friends), Mr. Bingham was elected chairman of The Yale Daily News and, as a junior, to Phi Beta Kappa. After Yale Law School, he practiced law for a time, then turned to government service. He held several State Department posts in the late forties and early fifties, and later went to Albany as secretary to Gov. Averell Harriman. In 1958, when Mr. Harriman was defeated by Governor Rockefeller, Mr. Bingham campaigned unsuccessfully for the State Senate. Mrs. Bingham, the former June Rossbach, is a grand‐ niece of the late Herbert H. Lehman, who was a founder of the Reform movement. Described by her friends as exceptionally intelligent and exceptionally attractive, she is considered an asset to her husband's campaign. “If she were running,” an acquaintance remarked, “I would say the odds would be tipped in favor of the Bingham ticket. She is really quite formidable.” The Binghams live in the Riverdale section of the Bronx in what Mrs. Bingham calls “an ugly old Victorian monstrosity of a house.” They have four children. The eldest, Mrs. James Bland, teaches high school in Arlington, Va.; the others — June, Timothy and Claudia — are still in school. Mr. Bingham relaxes with music. “He plays the violin, the viola, the cello, the piano and the victrola,” Mrs. Bingham says. “When one isn't going, the other is. I go for a walk.” To make the race for Congress, Mr. Bingham, who will be 50 on April 24, had to give up his job as United States Representative on the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations—a job he enjoyed. “It was a terrible wrench for him to leave,” a friend recalled. “But it's like a merrygo‐round. Even if you like the horse you're on, you'll get off to grab the brass ring. And politics is Jack Bingham's brass ring.”

1139-> Hop for the Hopeless
Miss R. W., an attractive 18‐oyear‐old, couldn’t cope with a complicated personal and family problem. When she dropped out of school at the age of 17, her situation seemed almost hopeless. Then someone recommended her to the Altro Health and Rehabilitation Service. After six months of tranning she become a qualified key punch operator. Altro then referred her to the State Youth Employment Service, which obtained for her a job she still holds. Meanwhile, a case worker works with Miss W. in helping her to resolve her personal problems. Altro is one of 40 health and welfare agencies in the Bronx that receive support from the Greater New York Fund. Citywide, the fund is affiliated with 425 community services. Your gift to the fund helps your borough and your city to maintain better community life.

1140-> ANOTHER APPROACH TO SKIING; Cross‐Country Touring, Long a Favorite Pastime in Europe, Is Beginning to Find Followers in the United States
THERE is a movement at hand that eventually may do much to make the skiing picture throughout the United States even broader than it is now. The movement, of which recreational skiers in different parts of the country are the sponsors, would find more skiers turning to what is known as touring, or crosscountry skiing; this is a pastime that remains as perhaps the most popular phase of snow‐running in Europe's Scandinavian countries and which still holds a strong place in the Alpine regions. What the sponsors are championing specifically is a program that calls for slow and easy travel in the snow country, with more time out to enjoy the scenery and the exhilarating mountain air and perhaps even a cookout in the great outdoors. It must be noted, however, that the more zealous proponents of the movement are not limiting their recruiting program to the older skier. Youngsters also have been encouraged to participate, with the result that touring in the United States has begun to take on a definite family motif. Typical is the situation at Burlington, Vt., where members of the staff of Mary Fletcher Hospital make regular weekend trips on skis over terrain ranging from the local golf course to nearby areas at higher elevations. It has become commonplace to see these enthusiasts—physicians, nurses, attendants and their families—head for the open air with rucksacks on their backs. At Dartmouth College in Hanover, N. H., faculty members also have sparked a movement in a similar direction. A slower pace for sportsmen and women in their 40's and 50's is nothing new. In tennis, for example, it has become a matter of course for court enthusiasts to start playing doubles instead of singles as they advance in years. In golf, the cart has become the most popular mode of links transportation. Aware that the operators of some ski areas may not be happy about supporting a cause that may produce more skiers but fewer cus tomers for the lift‐lines, advocates of touring emphasize that their phase of the sport will serve to interest more men and women in snow‐running than ever before. They point out that mastering touring is comparatively easy and certainly less dangerous than skiing itself. Hence, more people are willing to don the hickories. "It has worked out that way already,” a spokesman for the New York Ski Touring Council, a group made up entirely of downhill skiers, said recently. “A newcomer finds it easy to walk over snow‐covered terrain that is not steep. After two weekends with groups, he usually is eager to try the lift‐lines. Recreation downhill skiing thus finds itself with a recruit, and so do we.” The art of touring is not nearly as complicated as downhill skiing. The technique simply calls for a push on one leg and a glide with the other. The beginner is never taken on a trip that includes anything resembling a steep descent. For the ascent, a suitable wax is rubbed over the bottom of the skis so that they will not back up. Wax has replaced the old custom of using animal skins for upward travel on the slopes. Nor does touring equipment cost as much as the gear required for downhill skiing. Touring skis are narrower than the more familiar Alpine type of runner, but they also are longer. In contrast to an outlay of $32 to $200 for downhill skis, touring hickories run between $17.50 and $42.50. The more expensive products have steel edges, which enable the skier to go down hill with greater ease than with the woodenedged ones. There also is a considerable saving in the matter of boots, since footwear for the touring, or cross‐country, enthusiast is smaller and more pliant. In contrast to the bulky downhill boot, the touring boot barely touches the shinbone. Rounding out the picture for the touring skier is a binding that gives freedom to the heel, thus enabling it to be raised during the pushing motion. Touring enthusiasts emphasize that it is not necessary for a downhill skier to junk his Alpine runners just because he decides to engage in a bit of cross‐country travel. They advise that touring bindings now on the market can be used on the regular Alpine ski, along with the regular ski boot. However, they concede that travel is much easier with the Scandinavian type of equipment. There seems to be little doubt that touring has made substantial strides in the United States in the last three years. John Wictorin of Ridgefield Park, N. J., an importer of touring gear, claims that requests for it have trebled in recent years. Whereas he sold 150 pairs of skis and boots in 1961, he already has disposed of 500 combinations this winter. Throughout the ski country, managers of various areas are opening up touring trails in increasing numbers. At the present time, such layouts can be found at Stratton, Killington, Mad River, Glen Ellen, Stowe and Big Bromley in Vermont, Cannon Mountain in New Hampshire, Lake Placid and other sectors of the Adiron dacks and even at the Belleayre center in the central Catskills. In the West, similar but more varied terrain is available at resorts such as Alta, Utah, and Aspen, Colo. Also in Vermont, the Green Mountain Club is working on a project that will enable it to make available to touring skiers a stretch of the Long Trail. It will extend from Mad River Glen in Waitsfield to Bromley in Manchester, a distance of more than 70 miles. In Europe, touring is expecially popular in Norway, Finland and Sweden. In Helsinki, for example, a skier can don his runners right outside the Olympic Stadium and follow the marked trails that encircle the city; in Oslo on the weekend of the annual Holmenkollen jumping championships, thousands of residents travel five and six miles on touring skis in order to reach the jumping hill.

1141-> How to Be a Stepparent
HERE are stepchildren in the United States. This figure,* the first statistic to be released on the subject, was arrived at by demographer Paul H. Jacobson for Anne W. Simon, whose cogent book, “Stepchild in the Family,” was published earlier this month (Odyssey Press; $5). While stepchildren have existed since Biblical days (Joseph's brothers, save Benjamin, were the product of his father's first marriage), the fact that one of every 10 children in this country has a stepparent today brings the problem into focus. Whether death or divorce has parted a child from mother or father, he has been forced to face not only a painful separation, but also the fact that his familiar two ‐ parent world has been smashed. Much has been written about death and divorce where children are involved. Considerably less attention has been directed toward remarriage and less still to the children affected by it. Add to this our expanding population, rising divorce rate and its steady companion, the rising remarriage rate, and the reaction of children to the new stepfamily becomes one of genuine concern to all. Mrs. Simon, herself a stepchild and now a stepmother, believes that the number of stepchildren will increase significantly in a year and become still larger with the decade. “The trend is established; the 1960's will demonstrate it,” she says. “It is in this decade that the growing number of children of divorce have crossed the path of the declining number of orphans and superseded them so that now, for the first time ever, there are more children of divorce!” HILE stepchildren themselves are a part of man's history, the phenomenon of large numbers of children adapting to separation, divorce and remarriage is new. In a childcentered society, which believes that the child predicts the man, the significance of *To get the figure (the Bureau of Census does not count stepchildren nor does any other government agency or private organization, Mrs. Simon reports), Jacobson calculated the number of children by age who are orphans, illegitimate, and children of divorce; then the number of parents of these who subsequentiy remarried was estimated, excluding marriages between natural parents that followed illegitimate births. this development is immediately apparent. The practical considerations raised for stepchild andstepparent alike are many and have been solved, in the past, in a variety of unchronicled, individual ways. To clarify how a child in this situation feels, Mrs. Simon proffers “A Stepchild Primer,” spelling out how a stepchild of any age and either sex bases his behavior toward a stepmother. “1. THE CHILD WANTS HIS MOTHER. But mother has gone — she is dead or divorced — and has thus betrayed him. Whom can he trust? “2. THE CHILD TURNS TO HIS FATHER. Together, the child thinks, they will accept mother's departure. Father will cherish and protect him. “3. FATHEK DESERTS THE CHILD. He marries another woman and loves Can he, will he continue to love the child too? What is a stepmother? “4. STEPMOTHER IS THE ENEMY. She comes between child and father, child and mother's memory. If she is gentle and wooing, the child thinks he's right in feeling wronged. If she is hostile, he is convinced of it. “5. STEPMOTHER IS LOVABLE. The child who no longer contains primitive hatred toward his own mother can accept a place in the restored family.” What has gone before, the child's age, sex and the wis‐dom that adults bring to bear on the new situation strongly influences how a child adjusts to the new family. The outside world, society in the larger sense, relatives and friends in the personal, generally cannot be counted on for much in the way of support. Knowledge of specific difficulties that arise in all such situations has been shrouded, in the past, by disapproval, guilt and fear, the latter emotions being common to those on both sides of the fence. To the new stepparent, the way ahead is far from clear. SOUND marriage has long been regarded as the root from which family life grows and flourishes. That this is no less true for remarriage would seem obvious. The best proof a confused, hostile stepchild can be offered that his shaky world will not come tumbling down again is the day‐byday tests of shared living. “You can't tell me what to do, you're not my mother,” an angry 8‐year‐old tells his father's new wife — a far cry from her rosy dreams of a romantic, love‐filled future. “I want Daddy to button me,” a beguiling 5‐year‐old says, rejecting her stepmother's offer and running to her father with a hug. Challenge after challenge confronts stepmother and father alike as they set about building their new life together. Despite the discouragements as dream gives way to reality, intelligence and perception can win out. The stepmother, who is coping with the daily difficulties of bringing up the family, must concentrate on understanding the child's feelings without being thrown by them. She must recognize the necessity for workable compromises. The initial difficulties are just as great for the stepfather — although different. More likely to be ignored than challenged by his stepchildren, he is often filled with confusion about “his” children, “her” children and “their” children and frequently plagued by financial considerations. The stepfather, too, must bring the weight of intelligence, love for his wife and a genuine concern for the children to bear. Mrs. Simon also charts basic stepchild emotional attitudes for stepfathers: “1. THE CHILD WANTS HIS MOTHER. He wants to keep her to himself and had succeeded until stepfather came along. “2. THE CHILD WANTS HIS FATHER, TOO. When father disappeared, the child worried; his secret wishes about father might have caused the departure. Perhaps his father doesn't love him any more. “3. MOTHER MAY NOT LOVE THE CHILD. If she does, why did she marry again? He must find out whether she will still be his mother. His research is likely to be less than scholarly. “4. STEPFATHER IS A RIVAL. He is a competitor for mother's love and for the child's notion of his own father. And he is bigger than the stepchild. “5. STEPFATHER BRINGS A NEW SECURITY. The child finds out that it is easier to love his mother and father from a stable family setting. A stepfather who likes him makes it possible.” F children could pinpoint the three major areas of difficulties, to which they themselves unwittingly often contribute, these would be emotions, discipline and money. Both stepmother and stepfather must. if they wish to succeed, examine their own feelings honestly. There is no guarantee that because a woman loves a man or vice versa. that she is necessarily going to love his children Certainly not right away at least. In many cases there is reason to feel just the opposite. A child may resemble the absent parent, have his or her mannerisms, conflicting values. This is particularly apparent in visiting stepchildren who come on weekends, for vacations or part of the year. Intelligence tells one that it is no more necessary to love a child at first glance than to love one's in‐laws at first glance. But the same intelligence points out that if a marriage is to succeed, every effort to understand the child and his feelings must be made. No less an authority than Dr. Spock has said: “My hunch is that almost every stepchild, even though he develops an excellent relation‐ ship with the stepparents, will want to continue to think of this as different from his relationships with his own mother and father. He may not want to call a stepfather, ‘father.’ This should not be felt as a sign of reproach by the stepparent or as a sign of his failure even to a slight degree. . . . The wise stepparent should show that he understands this distinction and respects it. ” Although this may be less likely in the case of small children, particularly those whose relationships with the absent parents are tenuous or nonexistent. it is certainly applicable to the transient or weekend stepchild. Pointing up the fallacy in categorizing the relation in advance, Mrs. Simon tells the story of a young boy who was carefully instructed by his progressively minded mother that her new husband would be his friend. Asked by a visitor some months after the marriage “How do you like your new father?” the boy replied, “He's not my father, he's my friend . . . and I hate him.” Matters of discipline must, of course, be resolved, not by abandoning control or im‐ posing rigid do's and don't's but with an effort to understand the child's contradictory attitude which requires fair limits even as he seemingly fights against them. MONEY is perhaps the most difficult of all areas in the stepchild galaxy, just as it is m the ordinary family orbit. It is the hallmark of our materially oriented culture that money represents many things, often different things to different people. Harold Lasky, the British economist, once observed that “in America when a man looks fit his friends don't tell him how well he looks, they say he looks like a million dollars.” To the stepmother on a tight budget, money going to her husband's former wife and children may represent not only a financial drain but also an emotional investment that she feels threatening to her marriage. To the stepfather, his wife's children may seem to him a financial drain that he is required to make “for another man' s children.” In this, as in all aspects of stepfamily life, the amount of insight into one's own emotional boundaries, the sincerity of the desire of both adults to demonstrate their love for one another and their sense of decency as individuals through building a good relationship with their stepchildren will determine the success or failure of the venture. As one stepchild, now married herself, puts it, “I'm sure I must have been hell on wheels to handle when my father and stepmother married and I remember feeling different from other children. But somehow the fact that they looked on me primarily as a child and were so sure in their own affection made things work out. In a sense we grew up together; I can't imagine having had anyone else as parents.”

1143-> Gulfstream Twin Double Pays $84,114, but Winner Doesn't Appear; TRACK THEORIZES TICKET IS TORN UP; Bettor May Have Destroyed Mutuel Before Change in Result of Eighth Race
HALLANDALE, Fla., March 5 (AP) ‐A bettor in the $1 general admission seats at Gulfstream Park scored the largest payoff in. United States horse racing history today$84,114.20 for $2‐but he may have thrown the ticket away. The holder of the only good ticket after three races did not appear at the pari‐mutuel windows before they closed at 6:30 P.M. However, he can cash the ticket anytime before the meeting closes April 23. There was a chance the bettor had discarded the ticket because his horse, Initabas, had finished second in the eighth race. However, the winner, Gathering Dusk, was disqualified and Initabas, a $115.40 shot, was moved into first place. Ordinarily the twin double requires the bettor to pick the winner of four races‐the fifth, sixth, eighth and ninth here. But when Initabas was declared the winner of the eighth, there was only one good ticket left, and it was worth the entire twin double pool. The horse the winning ticket was coupled with in the ninth race, Spendapenie, finished ninth in a fieldof 10. Doctor Hank K. was the winner. Gulfstream Park's president, James Donn Jr., said there was a good chance the bettor had thrown his ticket away. On the other hand, he said, the bettor may have been so stunned that he went home to calm himself before collecting. No plans were being made to sift sweepings off the grandstand floor for the ticket. There was no more than the usual amount of stooping over to check the tickets on the floor because the public Was unaware the winner had not collected. The previous twin double record was $79,660.30 in harness racing at Roosevelt Raceway last Nov. 6. The largest previous twin double on a thoroughbred track was the $75,002.20 last Jan. 11 at Tropical Park. The first two parts of the twin double, picked by 218 fans, were Scattergood, who paid $142.60 for winning the fifth race, and Ool. Mengel, who paid 8.60 for the sixth. After Gathering Dusk had finished first in the eighth, Gene Monacelli protested that he had been bumped at,the eighth pole. The stewards upheld the protest, and Initabas was awarded first place. An apprentice jockey, Eddie Truman, was suspended for 10 days for careless riding aboard King's Idyl in Wednesday's second race. The suspension begins Saturday and ends March 16.

1145-> A RELIC OF THE DAYS WHEN THE WEST WAS WILD
TOMBSTONE, Ariz.—Well sir, they have refurbished and reopened the old saloon where Wyatt Earp used to hang out, and you might say that Tombstone is sort or jumping again — without the stimulus of flying bullets. The Crystal Palace Bar, where the frontier élite and unélite met during the “Silver Town's” heyday, was restored this month in all its 1881 elegance. Earp once ran a faro game there. The center of attraction is the 45‐foot‐long mahogany bar. It was duplicated in exact detail from photographs of the old Crystal Palace. Old prints also were used in reproducing the large Victorian ceiling lamps and the inlaid‐patterned wood floor. The walls are papered in white and gold, with a golden eagle design. This commemorates the first name of the establishment — The Golden Eagle Brewery—when it was built in 1879. The Crystal Palace was deemed more attractive to,the carriage trade. Those were the days when Tombstone's population, spurred by rich mines such as Doughnut and Lucky Cuss, was many times the present 1,500. But now, 85 years Iater, a group called Historic Tombstone Adventures is making this a very Iively ghost town indeed. Restoration of the Crystal Palace was project No. 1 of the H. T. A., a corporation headed by three Detroiters and William Murray, a Utica, N. Y., businessman. Controller and resident manager is John Dunn, a retired Internal Revenue agent from Springfield, Ill. The next project will be the rebuilding of Schieffelin Hall, the one‐time theatrical center of the Arizona Territory. It is scheduled to be reopened June 1 with a presentation by the University of Arizona Players. The hall was built and named for the founder of Tombstone, Ed Schieffelin, the quixotic character who also gave the town its name. Schieffelin, an itinerant prospector, had been told that all he would find in the Cochise Indian hills would be his tombstone. He managed to dodge all arrows, discover ample lodes of silver and, in 1877, triumphantly named the location “Tombstone.” Schieffelin and many of his pioneer cronies lie buried in Boothill Cemetery, just outside town on U.S. 80. He is one of the seeming minority who died natural deaths in old Tombstone. Today, the community is sustained largely by tourists and the nearby Army base at Fort Huachuca. Tombstone is nestled on a 4,500‐foot mesa between the Huachuca and Dragoon Mountains in southeastern Arizona; it is 70 miles from Tucson and 30 miles from the Mexican border. Several of Boothill's 250 occupants were victims of Indian uprisings, but most were victims of their own depredations. Three such were Tom and Frank McLowery and Billie Clanton; they were killed on Oct. 26, 1881, in the fabled gun battle between the Earp and Clanton contingents at the O. K. Corral. At that time, Earp was a deputy marshal, helping his brother, Virgil. The Clantons and McLowerys were cowboys who got a bit too wild on the town and resisted arrest. The O. K. Corral is still standing on Allen Street, just down the block from the Crystal Palace. Others who lie in Boothill include George Johnson, “hanged by mistake;” Old Man Clanton, from whose grave a prickly ocotillo cactus grows abundantly; Dutch Annie, and a woman known only as Mrs. Stipt. Mrs. Stipt, whoever she was, rated a wrought‐iron fence around her grave. She is the lone occupant so honored. Frontier humor, seldom subtle, shows in several epitaphs. As direct as any is this one: “Here lies Lester Moore. “Four slugs from a '.44. “No Les “No more.” Tombstone, the town that proclaimed itself as “too tough to die,” now has a slogan of “History, Health and Hospitality.” Its annual Helidorado celebration is one of Arizona's liveliest re‐creations of frontier days. It is held in October. The weekly newspaper, The Tombstone Epitaph, has been coming out regularly since 1880. Mabel A. Smith, widow of Clayton Smith, long‐time editor and publisher, is continuing to put out the paper. Mr. Smith was killed recently in an airplane crash near here. Tombstone has two of the finest examples of frontier Gothic architecture existing in the Southwest. They are the City Hall and the former Cochise County Courthouse, now a state historical museum. The City Hall is still in use. The mayor, Thomas Pitcher, also is school superintendent at Fort Huachuca. From the flagstaffs at both buildings fly Old Glory and the Arizona Territory flag. The county seat long ago moved to Bisbee. By 1912, when Arizona became a state, Tombstone had begun its franchise on ghosthood. The once‐bustling railroad station is now the library. It is called the ”Reading Station.” The town still lives more in the past than in the present, although a number of souvenir shops trade mightily on both. The H. T. A., Mr. Dunn says, has million available to develop the area. Along with resurrection of local shrines will come motels and restaurants. According to the H. T. A. blueprints, a 100unit motel is scheduled for construction by 1965. The town's big boost, of course, has come from television and its virtual deification of Earp. No matter where you look down Main Street—Earp. The Wyatt Earp Building houses a clothing store, men's and women's. But the Wyatt Earp Cafe has fallen afoul of changing tastes, or maybe just unenterprising management. It is padlocked, for sale or for rent. Down the street, near the Crystal Palace and obviously enjoying relative prosperity, is Rossi s Pizza Parlor.

1146-> Antonia Climbs the School Ladder; DON'T KNOCK THE CORNERS OFF. By Caroline Glyn. 256 pp. New York: Coward‐McCann. $3.95.
IDS are tough. They have to beto survive the ordeal of education as described by an English girl—who began, at 14, this hair‐raising but comical chronicle of school life from a child's angle. The book is fiction, we are assured. No school could be as awful and absurd as those attended by her irrepressible heroine, but this is how they seemed at the time. Caroline Glyn now a mature and cheerful 16, is the greatgranddaughter of Lady Elinor Glyn, whose “Three Weeks” was once considered so shocking. Times have changed. Amorous dalliance on a tiger skin is Out; resisting efforts to hammer square pegs into round holes is In. Miss Glyn's Antonia is 9 when she enters a coeducational primary school where life is a free‐for‐all, boys against girls, all against teachers. Self‐preservation is the chief lesson, but somehow she must learn enough to pass the competitive examination, the dreaded “11 plus,” which sorts out those considered worth herding towards a university. writer and  The next step in the process of battering her into shape is in a girls school where tradition imposes strict discipline, high ideals and masses of homework. She learns a lot but not how to conform. Brilliant at English (like Miss Glyn, Antonia is a published poet), she is always in trouble because she is no good at games and impervious to mathematics. In a third school, discipline and teaching are minimal; sex is the main preoccupation, though the pupils are supposed to concentrate on passing another examination to enable them to leave school at 16. The valiant Antonia takes this hurdle in a flying leap—and, scorning Oxford, studies art. At last she fits in. To her astonishment she finds she can talk to a boy and like it. “Art students still have their corners on. They've escaped. I've escaped. Everything's going to be all right after all.” Three rousing cheers for Antonia and for the author who has so faithfully portrayed her. At times, one doubts that gifted girls are quite so verbal at 12, boys so loutish at any age and teachers so invariably ludicrous, inept or tyrannical. Also, Antonia's artistic parents (as gay as they are loving) arouse my envy for her luck. But on the whole the story rings true. Growing up is always a sort of pilgrim's progress towards a Promised Land. But Caroline Glyn tells her tale with such youthful zest and mockery of the monsters met and overcome on the way that it is impossible not to applaud her perseverance and her achievement.

1147-> A'S DOWN SENATORS IN 6‐INNING GAME, 5‐1
WASHINGTON, April 19 (UPI)—Orlando Pena pitched a two‐hitter today as the Kansas City Athletics scored their first victory of the season by down­ing tte Washington,Senators, 5‐1, in a game that was called after six innings because of rain. Pena struck out nine batters beiore a downpour ended the contest and also forced the post­ponement of the second game of a scheduled double‐header. The Athletics scored three runs in the fifth inning. A men­tal lapse by the Washington outfielder, Chuck Hinton, al­lowed two rwms to score on a sacrifice fly. Leading, 2‐1, the A's filled the bases with one out. Jim Gentile lofted a routine sacrifice fly to Hinton in left field to drive in Nelson Mathews from third. When Hinton, un­der the impressino that there were three out, trotted toward the dugout, ' Ed Charles raced around third and scored also. Doc Edwards singled home the third run of the inning. Hinton, whose error allowed an uiiearned Kansas City run in the third, was benched by Manager Gil Hodges after his blunder. The only W ashington hits off Pena were triples by Don Blasingame in the first and Ed Brinkman in the fourth.

1149-> Swiss Franc Shows Big Gain; Swedish Krona Also Advances
The Swiss franc scored a sharp gain in trading yesterday on the New York foreign exchange markets. It closed at 23.15¾ cents, compared with a final quotation of 23.13½ cents on Wednesday. The Swiss franc for future delivery, which had previously been sold at a discount, was traded yesterday at a premium of ⅜ of a point. Traders here said that the continued firmness of the Swiss currency in recent sessions has been brought about by a tightening of money in circulation in that country and a large influx of foreign currencies there. The Swedish krona was firmer in response to the Riksbank's announcement of a tightening in that country's credit policy. It closed at 19.45½ cents, up a full point from the previous day's closing price. At its monthly meeting with commercial banks yesterday, the Swedish central bank announced that it was reducing the amount of capital a commercial bankmay borrow without being subject to a punitive interest rate.

1150-> ARABS CONFUSED ON FAIN ISRAEL; Reaction on Jordan Waters Plan Shows Disarray
BEIRUT, Lebanon, May 8—Israel's announcement that a test diversion of the Jordan River's waters to the Negev has begun has set off an outburst of confused indignation in the Arab press, directed mainly against the inaction of Arab governments. The most vehement complaints were those of the Baathists of Damascus. The Baathist line was that, though others might fail, Syria would do her duty. It noted that the Foreign Ministry had promised a full statement on the Syrian Government's policy. Although Syria endorsed the Arab leaders' resolutions on the use of the Jordan River last January, the Baathists have turned progressively against that declaration, as if it had been a traitorous conspiracy by kings and presidents, other than President Amin el‐Hafez, to avoid fighting Israel. The independent press of Beirut voiced ironical disgust. Kamel Mrowa of Al Hayat commented: “We do not want to embarrass anyone while our Arab armies are spread out eastward and westward. But we would like to make one last remark: Yesterda.y passed without any popular reaction against this Israeli action. What has happened to the Arabs?” The press, supporting President Gamal Abdel Nasser's United Arab Republic discreetly, put faith in the January resolutions and concentrated on other matters, such the alleged revolution against the British in South Arabia, Israel's campaign to oblige West Germany to withdraw its scientists from Egypt and Premier Khrushchev's visit to Cairo. Until today the Cairo press had not mentioned the Israeli announcement. For, these various attitudes there are explanations. The most palpable, in the case of Cairo, seems to be Mr. Nasser's decision to plunge deeper into Yemen, where he has committed 40,000 men in a supreme bid to crush the royalists. While this force remains in Yemen, Mr. Nasser could not take on Israel, nor could the other Arab states. This brutal reality in the Middle East has been sugarcoated for the Arab public by Mr. Nasser's propagandistic emphasis on the campaign against the British in Aden and the South Arabian Federation, as if the effort in Yemen were primarily for the popular purposepose of opposing the British. In fact, however, the effort against the British is largely subversive, including the equipping of small bands of guerrillas. Emphasis on the campaign against the British “imperialists” serves the further purpose of distracting the Arab public's attention from the Jordan River issue, for whose solution some long‐term steps have been taken, but nothing immediate and tangible. An Arab League technical committee, accompanied by Secretary General Abdel Khalik Hassouna, looked over the terrain of the headwaters of the Jordan early in February. The committee met in Damascus in March and is to meet again in Beirut this month. Meanwhile, Field Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer, as head of the unified Arab command, has arrived in Bghdad on the first stage of a tour of Arab capitals to set up a force that might eventually oppose Israel on the Jordan waters issue. Mr. Khrushchev's visit has provoked the Baathist Syrian press to contrast the Soviet Union's attitude on Palestine with that of Communist China, much to the advantage of the Chinese, who have taken a proArab line. Among the Arabs, the Syrians offer the Chinese Communists their only sure base. A Chinese industrial delegation has arrived in Damascus to discuss ways for the Syrians to use a credit equivalent to $22 million extended by Peking.

1152-> Castle Forbes Triumphs In the Acorn at Aqueduct
Castle Forbes, a bay filly from the Wheatley Stable, made her first stakes victory of the year an impressive one yesterday by capturing the $60,150 Acorn at Aqueduct. The capable 3‐year‐old displayed late speed in overtaking two rivals in the drivedown the homestretch and beat Hickory's Sceree by 1¼ lengths. The favored Face the Facts saved the third spot, trailing the runner‐up by half of a length, Kept off the early pace, the Wheatley color ‐ bearer was clocked in 1:37 for the mile. Entered with a stablemate, Bold Queen, the pair left the post as the second choice and returned $6.90 for a $2 ticket to win. John Rotz, who rode the winner, did a superb job of rating the filly. In seventh place throughout much of the backstretch, the Forest Hills jockey put his mount under urging rounding the stretch turn. The filly responded immediately. “We were about seventh down the backstretch in between horses' said Rotz after the race, “and when I asked her to run at about the three‐and‐a‐halffurlong pole, I took her outside. I was hitting her pretty good through the stretch, but she sure finished good.” Castle Forbes gave her back‐ ers few worries once she reached the furlong pole. By that time she was running at her best. She showed no difficulty thereafter in passing the favorite and Bold Queen. Donald Pierce, who had replaced the suspended Manuel Ycaza on Face the Facts, had no excuses. “She made the lead easy, but once she got in front, she didn't seem to be willing. She hung at the finish. She wasn't her usual self in the stretch.” Indeed, the choice seemed to have matters under control as the 12 horses in the field, each carrying 121 pounds, rounded the far turn. The daughter of Court Martial and Vashti was moving easily. Just before the final turn she had a halflength lead. It was then that the theme of the proceedings began to change. Castle Forbes, running four horses wide, began to make her big bid. Bold Queen passed Face the Facts to take command and Sceree, who had slipped from second to fourth, began charging again. In the middle of it all, Bobby Ussery, aboard Bold Queen, and Pierce began struggling to meet the challenges. But it was futile. Castle Forbes, running strongly, had no trouble in taking the lead just past the eighth pole. Sceree made a determined effort to keep up with the leader but failed. In the meantime, Face the Facts found herself in dire straits in trying to protect third place from the onrushing Miss Cavandish. She succeeded in doing so by only a nose. The victory, witnessed by a crowd of 50,166, was the third in a row for the Wheatley representative. Beaten convincingly in her first outing of the season last April on a sloppy track, Castle Forbes came on to capture two allowance events. As a result of this latest success, the Court Martial filly resumed her way along the big money trail. Last season, she earned $237,690. Yesterday, she addde $39,097 to the $13,500 she had won previously this year. The contest produced an unhappy note for A. W. Beuzeville, the trainer of Verna Lea Farm's Nilene Wonder. The filly, with Johnny Sellers up, broke down rounding the stretch turn. She was said to have suffered a dislocated sesamoid bone in the left front leg. Until that point, Nilene Wonder had succeeded in making her presence felt. She kept close to the early pace through the backstretch. Just before the mishap, she was in third place and semed about to make an important bid. Castle Forbes has two more hurdles to cross to gain the triple crown for fillies. The other contests are the $75,000added Mother Goose at a mile and a furlong and the $100,000added Coaching Club American Oaks at a mile and a quarter. Both events will be held at Aqueduct next month. In the $7,500 Empire State, which preceded the feature, Rolling Sea overtook the oddson favorite, Running Bowline, in the stretch to win the sevenfurlong dash by a half length. The winner, timed in 1:25, returned $22.60. Six scratches in the feature eliminated the necessity of attaching the six‐stall starting gate to the regular 14‐stall setup. Withdrawals for Trilogy, Enchanting and Pennie Rice arrived in the secretary's office before the program went to press. Notices on Mid Victorian, Match Point and Ted Pepi just missed the printer's deadline and fans had to scratch the three fillies from the program. The program started on a note of discord. Ussery, the track's leading jockey, aboard favorites, had to survive claims of foul in the first two races. In the opener, Robert Stovall claimed Ussery, aboard Table Hopper, had struck his Ace Richard with his whip in the stretch. After the second, John Rotz, up on Haft Yanzdah, said Bob, guiding Good Oh, had impeded his mount in the back‐ F stretch. The stewards inspected the films of both races and saw no infractions. “They're making Ussery win the hard way. He had to go into the developing tank twice to bring home a daily double that was worth only $14.90. Frank M. Basil, vice president and treasurer of the New York Racing Association, will be the guest of honor at the annual South Queens Boys' Club dinner at the Statler‐Hilton Hotel Wednesday. Basil, a native of New York, is being honored for his services on behalf of Queens youth.

1153-> Man in the News; Spokesman for G.O.P.; Milton Stover Eisenhower
FRIENDS of Milton Stover Eisenhower have come to, think of him as a Renaissance man supremely endowed with the gift of getting the word across. They say his success is based on his ability to express exactly what he means, the way he can knife through to the heart of an issue and the way he can get others to work with him and for him gladly. This is prob‐ ably why Republicans turned to him once more yesterday to express one of their positions—this time their argument against the way the Administration has handled the situation in Panama. At 64 years of age, Mr. Eisenhower is the robust and dynamic president of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. As one of the university's administration put it: “He knows this business—the fund raising, the building programs, the faculty and the students.” From his office in a restored Georgian home built in 1802, Mr. Eisenhower maintains a seven‐day‐a‐week schedule. Despite the long hours, he has remained in close touch with the country's Republican leadership. Mr. Eisenhower's older brother by nine years, former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, lives about an hour's drive away, in Gettysburg, Pa. During the Eisenhower years, Milton was among the President's closest adVisers. When he was President, General Eisenhower said that his younger brother had done more than any other person to shape his ideas of the proper functions of government. Mr. Eisenhower's chairmanship of the Critical Issues Council of the Republican Citizens Committee shows that other Republicans are still listening to him. Mr. Eisenhower started out as a reporter, switched to government and ended up as president of three universities and a Presidential trouble‐shooter. He has 29 lines in “Who's Who in America.” His older brother has nine fewer. Milton was born in Abilenc, Kan., Sept. 15, 1899. He was the youngest of seven Eisenhower brothers, five of whom survive. Milton and Dwight were closer to each other than any of the other brothers. While a student at Kansas State College, Mr. Eisenhower became city editor of The Abilene Daily Reflector. He later taught journalism before qualifying for a Foreign Service position as vice consul in Edinburgh. He went to Washington later, where he directed the informationprograms of a succession of Republican and Democratic Secretaries of Agriculture. In World War II, as his brother rose to General of the Army, he became an associate director of the Office of War Information. He resigned from the Government in 1943 to accept the presidency of Kansas State College. It. was at this time that he said: “Education in a democracy must at all times be concerned with human values and human growth.” Students today at Johns Hopkins regard Dr. Eisenhower as a man sympathetic with their values. They have access to his office, where he sits smoking a pipe and listens to their problems. While at Kansas and later when he was president of Penn State, Mr. Eisenhower served Democrats and Republicans alike as a fact‐finder at home and abroad. His critics say that Mr. Eisenhower has been long on words and short on action, particularly in Latin America. Some of his jobs included part‐time work at the United Nations Education, Social and Cultural Organization and temporary posts for his brother, who once told a Congressman: “You don't have to sell Milton to me. If it wasn't for his name he would have a very high Government position.” Mr. Eisenhower's wife, Helen, died in 1954. Their son, Milton, lives in Long Island and a daughter, .Ruth, near the Johns Hopkins campus with her husband and child. Mr. Eisenhower, who lives alone on the campus, tries to get away during the summer for fly fishing in Wisconsin. At other times, he relaxes by playing classical and show tunes on his electric organ.

1154-> MUSTANG ADDED TO AUTO OUTPUT; Ford Builds 743 as Industry Tops Previous Week
DETROIT, March 16 (AP)—The auto industry's newest car, the Ford Mustang, showed up for the first time this week in the industry's production reports. Ford built 743 of the Mustangs at its Dearborn assembly plant last week, in which period the industry turned out an estimated total of 164,767 cars. The Mustang will make its debut at the New York World's Fair next month. The production mark of 164,- 767 units was well ahead of the 161,536 cars built in the preceding week and the 151,140 built in the similar week of 1963. Auto plants last week turned out the 2 millionth vehicle of the calendar year. It was not possible to determine which plant actually built the car. Ward's Automotive Reports, trade journal, said 1964 auto output was running almost 8 per cent ahead of last year. It predicted that assemblies in March would pass the 700,000 mark. If that goal is attained, it would be only the second time in automotive history. In March, 1955, the output was 794,015 units. Auto makers, while confident that a spring sales boom was in the offing, kept a close wach on the market, especially as new‐car inventories reached an all‐time peak of 1,175,000 at the end of February. Most auto makers saw no sales problems in the immediate future, but a few cautious observers thought the inventory level was a bit too high. Ford was the only producer to turn out cars on an overtime pay basis last Saturday. Six of its 16 plants were on overtime. Chrysler, American Motors and General Motors worked five‐day weeks. A survey of model‐year production showed that about 4.5 million cars have been built since the first '64's rolled off the assembly lines last August. This is about 10 per cent of the number turned out in the like period of 1963. The weekly production table prepared by Automotive News, a trade publication, showed:  Week Ended 3-14‐64 Week Ended 3‐7‐64 1‐1‐63 to 3‐16‐63 1‐1‐64 to 3‐ 4‐64 Chrysler ... 3,500 3,571 27,746 3,70 Imperial ... 350 336 1,855 ,31 Plymouth .. 4,700 5,073 56,831 5, 00 Valiant .... 4,650 4,511 45,088 4, 77 Dodge ..... 9,300 9,410 78,557 9, 52 Total Chrysler .. 22,50 23,301 210,077 239,319 Falcon...... 6, 6,085 67,177 72,4 6 Fairlane ... 5, 4,306 68,456 62,0 7 Galaxie .... 19, 19,583 177,305 200,5 7 Mustang  ..... ...... 7 3 Thunderbird 2, 2,257 16,254 27,0 1 Eincoln ....  605 5,939 7,5 5 Comet ..... 4, 7 4,532 20,964 43,609 Mercury ... 2, 1 2,454 24,083 24,831 Total Ford ..... 41,719 39,822 389,561 438,909 Buuck ..... 6,071 6,320 62,028 59,040 Buick Riviera 1,046 1,048 10,898 9,283 Buick Special 4,340 4,385 35,822 4,834 Cadillac .. 3,780 3,830 40,375 4,989 Chevelle ... 7,200 7,139 ........ 7,216 Chevy N .. ,500 , 61 82,428 ,36 Chevrolet ... 3,400 3,27 364,825 3,93 Corvair . .. ,200 , 70 63,960 ,18 Olds F‐85 .. ,800 , 63 28,023 ,26 Oldsmobile . ,500 , 43 83,066 ,04 Pontiac . 1,250 1, 25 102,677 1,18 Pont Tempest ,250 , 98 29,200 ,86 Total Gen.

1157-> SOVIET PLANS RISE IN TRADE AND AID; Geneva Delegate Pledges Help to Underdeveloped
GENEVA, March 26 — The Soviet Union promised more trade and aid for underdeveloped countries today and asked for more trade for itself with the West. Nikolai S. Patolichev, Minister of Foreign Trade, portrayed his country as sympathetic to the needs of the poor. “The Soviet Union has always been on the side of the peoples of the colonial and dependent countries in their justified aspiration and struggle against oppressors,” he said in a speech at the United Nations Confer- ence on Trade and Develonment. His speech was larded with disdain for capitalist ways. But when he got to, cases, he was more restrained than United States officials said that they had expected him to be. He recited a list of avenues through which the Soviet would help, or was willing to join in helping, the underdeveloped. He promised that Soviet imports of the products of underdeveloped countries would inorease eight times by 1980. He talked of world agreements to stabilize commodity trade. He proposed a new, global organization to deal with all international trade problems, calling it “a paradox” that none existed. He called for an international agreement among the industrial powers to make loans at less than 3 per cent to the underdeveloped. He indicated a willingness to join in many‐sided trade agreements, although the Soviet Union has traditionally been committed to two‐sided arrangements. However, a Soviet delegation spokesman explained that the multilateralism the Soviet Union was discussing required the West to end restrictions on Soviet trade. Western delegations called the presentation mild. It, was a day for mildness. The simmering dispute among African and Asian countries over how to move against South Africa and Portugal at the conference was resolved. A statement of rebuke and a pledge to ignore them was read by a representative of the nations that find South Africa's and Portugal's actions oppressive of Negroes and Asians. An Indian delegate read the statement, which said that South Africa and Portugal had “outlawed themselves from the world community by their obnoxious policies of racial discrimination and colonial oppression.” When the South African and Portuguese delegations speak during the three‐month conference, the protesting countries will absent themselves. The Soviet speaker raised the issue of the exclusion of Communist China, East Germany and others, but only as a critical observation. Thus, both political issues that might have stalled the conference have been set aside. The only direct argument that Mr. Patolichev presented against industrial powers was on the relative dimensions of Soviet and Western trade with the underdeveloped countries. Belgium's delegate had pointed out how much more Western Europe bought than the Soviet Union did. Mr. Patolichev said that Soviet trade with the underdeveloped countries had started only recently, “because the colonialists hampered this trade.” The Western industrial countries bought $21 billion in goods from underdeveloped countries in 1962 and the SovietUnion $1.2 billion.

1160-> LAUNCHER FALTERS, SATELLITE IS LOST
CAPEKENNEDY, Fla., March 19 (UPI)—The United States’ most successful satellite launcher faltered in flight today, ruining an attempt to orbit a satellite that was to be used in experiments with laser rays. The 120‐pound propellershaped satellite was launched at daybreak aboard a threestage Delta rocket that carried it over the Atlantic. The space agency said the first two stages of the Delta worked perfectly but that the third stage fired for only about half its normal burning time. The satellite, lacking the push needed to go into orbit, presumably fell into the earth's atmosphere. This was the first failure of the Delta racket in 23 successive launching attempts. Information that the satellite did not achieve orbital velocity came from tracking stations at Antigua and in Brazil. “This means that the satellite re‐entered the earth's atmosphere over the South Atlantic area east of Argentina and was destroyed,” the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said.

1162-> Arends Defends C.I.A. Against Critics
WASHINGTON, March 26—Representative Leslie C. Arends of Illinois, the assistant Repubican floor leader in the House, defended the Central Intelligence Agency today against its detractors. He described as untrue or as “based on half‐truths or distortions” published, allegations that the ageencv nad been penetrated by Soviet intelligence. He also assailed the published proposal of Representative John V. Lindsay, Republican of Main‐, hattan, for the establishnient of a new Congressional overseer for the C.I.A. Mr. Arends, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, is a member of one of the subcommittees for the intelligence agency. It is “quite understandable,” Mr. Arends said, that some member of Congress “might feel we are not as al acouamted with the operations of the C.I.A. as we should be.” “No one, except members of the subcommittee itseif, has any knowledge of just how extensively and intensively we inquire into the activities of this intelligence agency,” Mr. Arends went on. “We hold no public hearings. We issixe no reports. We cannot do otherwise and preserve the effectiveness of the C.I.A. as a secret fact - gathering agency on an international scale.” Mr. Arends said that “much of the criticism directed at the is not constructive.” For example he referred to what I he described as “the irresponsible series of articles concerning the C.I.A. that has been recently published in The New York Journa‐American.” In the series, Michal Goleniewsk a Polis who was said to have been highin the ranks of the Soviet secret service, was quoted as having said that Soviet agents had infiltrated the Central Intelligence Agency. Among the “wild accutations” in the articles, Mr. Arends said, was that the intelligence agency had tried to prevent Mr. Goleniewski from appearing before the Senate Internal Security subcommittee. “That simply is not true,” he said. Mr. Arends said he had been “very distressed” to read an article In Esquire magazine by Representative Lindsay. Mr. Lindsay has Iong advocated a joint Congressional committee to supervise the Central Intelligence Agency on the ground that existing subcommittees do not have sufficient authority to do the job. More than a hour after Mr. Arends spoke, Representative Michael A. Feighan, Ohio Democrat, charged that what Mr. Arerds had omitted about the Goleniewski case was “far more imnortant than what he said.” He asked: “Is it not true that Goleniewski revealed deep penetra‐tion into the C.I.A. by the Soviet K.G.B. [security police] ? Is it not true that a million dollars of C.I.A. funds fell into the hands of the K.G.B. and that $400,000 of that money was pumped back into the Communist party of this country?” Mr. Arends was also criticized by Mr. Lindsay, who said the minority whip was “playing ostrich” in his examination of the C.I.A. by “pretending nothing is there.” In New York, The JournalAmerican said it would have no comment.

1165-> N.A.A.C.P. ATTACKS UNION IN BIAS CASE; End of City‐State Contracts Involving Local 28 Urged
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has demanded the immediate cancellation of all city and state contracts that involve members of Local 28 of the Sheet Metal Workers International Association. The State Commission for Human Rights announced in a decision Wednesday that it had found the union guilty of having systematically barred Negroes from membership throughout its 76‐year history. The union has about 3,300 members, but there are no Negroes among them. Yesterday, Roy Wilkins, executive secretary of the N.A.A.C.P., disclosed that he had sent identical letters on Thursday to Governor Rockefeller and Mayor Wagner, contending that the decision had removed even the slightest reason for hesitating about cancelling contracts. A spokesman said the Mayor had not read the letter. The Governor's office said that Mr. Rockefeller, who was in New Hampshire campaigning for the Presidential primaries there, also had not received the letter. However, it was said that the Governor would probably not comment until all administrative and legal procedures in the Human Rights Commission's case had been exhausted. Last July, both officials warned that if discrimination were found on a construction job under their jurisdiction, contracts would be canceled. In ruling that Local 28 had violated the state law against discrimination by “automatically excluding” Negroes, the commission said it would issue a cease‐and‐desist order against the union. This will be followed, the agency said, by an “affirmative action”—that is, a further order setting forth positive steps the union must take to guarantee that discrimination against minority groups will be ended. If the sheet metal workers refuse to comply—and a court battle is considered a certainty —the commission will seek an enforcement order in State SuPreme Court. Asked for comment on the N.A.A.C.P. demand, the local's president, Mell Farrell, said: “I haven't seen it, so I can't make any comment. And we haven't got any order from the commission yet, so that's only a supposition.” The commission's decision, however, left little doubt that its order would be clear cut and strong. The rights agency said it would not tolerate Local 28's “monolithic racial pattern.” In addition to demanding the cancellation of present contracts, Mr. Wilkins called on the Governor and the Mayor to close the door on “any new contracts for public construction, in which Local 28 controls the labor force, until a realistic policy of nondiscrimination has been effectuated.” He further urged “the institution of foolproof practices and procedures to insure the policing and affirmative enforcement by the city and state of their policies of nondiscrimination in employment.” The civil rights leader reminded Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Wagner of the suit the N.A.A.C.P. has filed for an injunction that would halt nearly $10 million in state and city construction projects as long as there was alleged job discrimination against Negroes. Both the Governor and Mayor are named as defendants in the action, filed in State Supreme Court, as well as other city and state officials and the heads of nine building‐trades unions, including Local 28. At a hearing last November, the court ordered an early hearing on the merits of the case. The defendants appealed, filing a motion for dismissal. The motion is scheduled for a hearing in the Appellate Division next Thursday.

1172-> APPROVAL NEARS FOR TV DEBATES; Congressional Accord on Equal Time Is Reached
WASHINGTON, May 7—The prospect of televised debates between the Presidential candidates moved an important step toward realization today. House and Senate conferees agreed on a compromise version of bills already passed by each body permitting the Federal Communications Commission to suspend temporarily its equal‐time provision for broadcasts by political candidates. The proposal duplicates a measure enacted in 1960 under whichthe historic campaign debates between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon took place. The House approved sucha bill for the 1964 campaign last June and the Senate followed suit in October The House version called for suspension of the F. C. C. regulations in the last 75 days of the campaign and the Senate bill for a suspension of 60 days. Today's conferencereport is based on the Senate's 60‐day version. The bill may now be brought up in each chamber at any time, and passage seems assured. Legislation was necessary to set aside a provision of the communications act of 1934. This provision requires broadcasting companies allowing free time to any political candidate to “afford equal opportunities to all other candidates for that office,” including minor and splinter parties.

1174-> A QUIET MOMENT IN DAYTONA BEACH; Partying Is Interrupted by a Late Late Song Fest
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., March 27 — At 1:45 this morning, the Princeton Footnotes, a 15‐man glee club, led a cominunity sing on the patio of the Safari Motel, the storm center of the tornado of 30,000 students that is swirIing to this town. Hundredsof students took ‐a break from their all‐night room parties to line the terraces of the three‐story motel and softIy sing the ballads of Stephen Foster. A co‐ed from the University of Oklahoma dived fully clothed into the swimming pool and then joined in the singing, caressing the hair of a University of Connecticut man with one hand and holding a beer can in the other. It was a quiet moment in the vacation time that most of the students devote to the boisterous pursuit of pleasure. The late late sing was part of a program of—in city .officials’ words—“controlled entertainment” designed to keep the students occupied. The youths who drove bumper to bumper along the neon strip of motels, night clubs and drivein restaurants were hardpressed to find rooms early this morning, but there was no shortage of city‐sponsored entertainment. Some of the students preferred nocturnal swims to the three‐hour jazz and folk‐song concert in Peabody Municipal Auditorium, but the cool, 60degree weather discouraged beach parties.. “The Folk and Jazz Wingding,”asit is called, attracted a capacity audience of 2,500 students,-about half the number of students who spend their Easter Vacatitons in the main reading room of the New York Public Library. A caravan of 27 musicians and .“Christian athletes,” dedicated. to the spiritual salvation of the students, provided part of the entertainment. John Bozeman, the master of ceremonies, told the audience: “We’re mostly from seminaries, but we didn’t come down here to preach to you. I’m sure a lot of us aren’t any better than you are.” Don Shinnick, a linebacker for the Baltimore Colts football team, told the students, “The greatest I’ve ever played Is the game of life, and my coach is this person Jesus Christ.” The students listened in silence, then returned to the motels in search of parties. “You prowl around, knock on doors where you hear a lot of noise, sit down, shoot the breeze, and sing some songs ” said Dick Kennedy, 21 years old, of Michigan State University. His car, parked on the beach, was caught in the high tides this morning and drifted out to sea. It was towed back and junked. The students glory in crowds. More than 100 students sang endless choruses at a party thrown by a University of Utah man. From the parties, the students drive out of town to night clubs, such as the Rocket Lounge and the Chequer Board Lounge, open until 5 A.M. The clubs feature twist bands, and the students, who dance in the sun and rain, by day and by night, in cars and afoot, rise to the challenge. “A girl always has about 10 dates a day,” said Freddi Anne Berg, a coed from George Washington University Her date of the moment, Randy Zehmer of Virginia Tech, advised: “Never get a date ahead of time. They never show up.”

1175-> KENTUCKY UPSET BY GEORGIA TECH; Top‐Ranked Wildcats Suffer First Defeat by 76‐67 After Ten Victories
ATLANTA, Jan. 4—Georgia Tech upset the nation's topranked team, Kentucky, 76‐67, tonight in the opening Southeastern Conference basketball game for both teams. The loss was Kentucky's first this season after 10 victories. Tech raised its record to 6—3. R. D. Craddock, Tech's 5‐foot11‐inch captain, led the Yellow Jackets with 25 points. Cotton Nash, the Kentucky sharpshooter who entered the game with a 29.7‐point average, was held to 20. The Wildcats started slowly. Tech gained a 5‐1 edge before Kentucky scored its first field goal with almost five minutes elapsed. The Wildcats, who had trouble scoring from the field, rallied for a 32‐30 half‐time margin. Floor mistakes hurt them, however. Tech came out strong in the second half and pulled ahead to 55—43 with 10:35 remaining. Charlie Spooner, who trailed Craddock with 16 points, contributed key baskets, as did Mick Stenftenagel, who had 15 points. Ted Deeken, Kentucky's second high scorer with 18 points, fouled out with 3:18 remaining. Nash left the game on fouls with 54 seconds left. Tech lost two men on fouls—6‐10 Jim Caldwell and 6‐3 Ron Scharf. Kentucky never held the lead after three minutes of the second half. The Wildcats shifted to a zone defense midway in the half but were unable to contain the sharpshooting yellow Jackets. Tech connected on 49 per cent of its field‐goal attempts while Kentucky managed only a 44.1‐per cent rate. Tech hit an impressive 82.4 per cent at the free throw line, Kentucky 50 per cent. Caldwell led the Jackets in rebounds with 14. Deeken had 12 for Kentucky. It was the Wildcats' lowest score of the season.  G. F. P.

1177-> LAWYER TESTIFIES AT METER TRIAL; Denies Knowledge of Crime by Ex­Duncan Executive
A witness for the prosecution in the perjury trial of a Chicago industrialist testified here yesterday that he knew of no crime having been committed in connection with the sale of parking meters to New York City. The witness, Robert Todd Lang, former general counsel of the Nautec Corporation of Chicago, testified under crossexamination in the trial of Jerome J. Robinson, former president of the Duncan Parking Meter Company,a division of Nautec. Mr. Robinson, who is 56 years old, is charged with having lied to a grand jury here luy denying that he told Nautec officials that he had paid $25,000 as an “expense” in order to sell Duncan meters to the city. The statement was allegect,to have been made to the Nautec officials at a business meeting in Chicago's Standard Club on Aug. 3. 1961. The grand jury has until june 30 to continue its investigation as to whether a conspiracy existed to bribe public officials or give unlawful fees in connection with the repair, maintenance and sale of the city's parking meters. Mr. Lang, a 39 yearold, resident of Scarsdale, N. Y., and a member of the New York law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, had testified earlier that he had hear Mr. Robinson say on several occasions, including the disputed Aug. 3 meeting, that he had “laid out” the $25,000. Mr. Lang alsq, conceded that he had testified to “substantially” .the same thing before the grand jury. Sale Was Not Questioned Under intensive cross examination by Murray Gurfein, lawyer for Mr. Robinson, Mr. Lang said he had done nothing within his company to question the sale to the city, without public bidding, of 52,000 parking meters despite. Mr. Robinson's alleged expenses in that connection. Mr. Lang told Supreme Court Justice Arthur Markewich and the jury of eight men and four women: “I had no hard facts to go on. I had only conversa tion. No one ever gave nie any hard facts that anyone; had ever committed a crime. I don’t go around loosely accusing people of crimes.” In previous testimony under direct examination by assistant District Attorney Burton B. Roberts, Mr. Lang told of having been called “naive”’ by Mr. Robinson. Under oross examination by Mr. Gurfein yesterday, Mr. Lang conceded that he “did not know much about parking meters” or about the financial “hazards”: of their maintenance. Referring to Mr. Robinson's alleged demand that Nautec pay him $15 for each meter it sold to the city for $50 and to the $25,000 allegedly paid out as expenses, Mr. Lang, told the court that’ he thought Mr. Robinson “might be trying to get money for himself” of that “something was improper” or that there might have been a combination of the two.

Attending the awards ceremony were about 25 conservation leaders and the members of the Advisory Board on National Parks, now holding a four‐day meeting here. Mr. Udall took the occasion to pay tribute also to Rachel Carson, the author of “Silent Spring,” who died last night. “All of us here owe a debt to Rachel Carson,” Mr. Udall said. “All who knew her had great respect and affection for the quiet way she tried to do what she thought ought to be done.”

1179-> ARCHER DEFEATS TORRES IN BOSTON; Takes 10‐Round Decision in Dull Bout Booed by Fans
BOSTON, May 9 (UPI)—Joey Archer of New York City, a top‐ranking middleweight challenger, moved a step closer to a possible title bout tonight by outpointing Johnny Torres of Paterson, N. J., in 10 rounds at Boston Arena. There were no knockdowns in the fight, which was so dull fans cheered when the ring announcer said the 10th round wouldbe the last. The card drew 872 fans. Archer, fighting at 158 pounds, bloodied Torres's nose in the opening round with a series of left jabs. Archer relied on left jabs throughout the fight, interspersed with an occasional right. The crowd booed and jeered as Torres danced around the ring, seemingly intent on avoiding close combat with the New Yorker who had won 39 of his previous 40 professional fights. Torres, 155½, opened a small cut over Archer's left eyebrow in the fifth round. In the ninth, Torres's left jabs and wild rights succeeded in cutting Archer above the right eye. The gross gate was $1,817 and the net $1,708. Mike Pusateri, 164, of Brockton, Mass., scored a technical knockout over Tommy Settles, 164, of Jamaica, L. I., at 1:14 of the fourth round of an eightround semifinal. In the preliminaries, Jesse Ammons, 143, of Boston outpointed Tom Flynn, 147, of Boston, 4; Eddie Owens, 164, of Holyoke, Mass., knocked out Don Weber, 170, of Salem, Mass., 1, and Everett Copeland, 199, of Brooklyn, drew with Don Toro, 235, of New York City, 6.

1181-> Catholic Shift on Birth Control Predicted by Jesuit Sociologist
DALLAS, May 1—A Jesuit priest, speaking at a conference on planned parenthood, predicted today that the Roman Catholic Church would modify its stand on birth control. The Rev. John L Thomas, a professor of sociology at St. Louis University, said that he thought the debate within his church on oral contraceptives “was an extremely interesting and fruitful development” In an interview after his address to delegates of a national Planned Parenthood‐World Population Conference, Father Thomas declined to predict how extensively the Catholic doctrine on birth control might be revised. “There is considerable demand for an immediate decision,” he said “If a change is made hastily, it will be a small one. If it comes after a thorough study of the entire question of human sexuality, it could be a marked change.” The Roman Catholic Church does not now countenance any birth control device or medication. Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher of New York, national president of Planned Parenthood‐World Population, announced yesterday to the 380 delegates that a Catholic clergyman had agreed for the first time to join a national meeting on planned parenthood. He said: “I assume he had to get the permission of his Cardinal. Perhaps he had to go even higher.” But Father Thomas said today that he had accepted the invitation on his own initiative, without consulting his superiors in the church. “As a matter of courtesy, I wrote to the bishopric here to say that I would be coming into Dallas. That's all,” he said. Father Thomas, author of “The Catholic Viewpoints of Marriage and the Family,” was previously acquainted with many of the Planned Parenthood leaders. A pale, solemn‐looking man with thinning dark hair, the priest deftly answered the questions that followed his talk. For their part, the delegates seemed reluctant to challenge him on matters of church doctrine involving contraceptives. In reply to a question, Father Thomas said that there was growing awareness in his church that restrictions on reproduction were necessary in any sizable modern nation. Within the last six months, he said, a number of church‐sponsored clinics, teaching the church‐approved “rhythm method” of birth control, have been opened across the nation. The four‐day conference, being held at the Sheraton‐Dallas Hotel, will end tomorrow.

1182-> Architecture: That Midtown TowerStanding Naked inthe Wind; Skyscraper Buffs See Antique Skeleton; FancySteel Framing Elaboratedby Rivets
THERE is a new’ kind of curiosity in Times Square these days — a Ripley‐believe‐it‐or‐not for the technically‐ minded. Ever since the Times Tower was stripped of its masonry skin for the complete remodeling and refacing that is being carried out by its new owners, the Allied Chemical Corporation, its antique steel skeleton has been an object of special interest to skyscraper buffs. For three months now, the remodeling has proceeded, the skeleton has stood naked, but not shivering, in the wind. It hasn't shivered since 1904, when it went up, because it has an elaborate and quite archaic system of wind‐bracing that makes it extremely rigid and sturdy. It is as fascinating to skyscraper‐watchers who are interested in what makes building stand up as a Bugatti Royale is to automobile fans. Allied's remodeling will replace except the steel skeleton, which will carry an all‐new building. If this old, completely serviceable frame is a curiosity today, it was even more of a curiosity when it was built. The year 1904 was an early date for skyscrapers, and the 22‐story, 375‐foot Times Tower the tallest building in New York. It took the record away from the 20story, 286‐foot Flatiron Building of 1902, a similarly shaped structure on a similar site. Architects only been building the big ones since the mid‐1880's, when Chicago engineers had developed the strong metal frame with its thin, nonsupporting curtain wall that made new heights possible. Basically, the 1904 model and the 1964 model are the same. But appreciation of the difference in details makes the skyscraper connoisseur. In both models, cage of steel columms and beams, reinforced to resist winds, is covered with an outside — stone or brick then, more often glass or metal panels now. To say that they don't build them anymore the way they did In the old days, however. is literally true. The Tower is a collector's item. It is full of vintage structural details. The Tower is radical and conservative at the same time. Its stodgy masonnry exterior deliberately suggested the Giotto campanile in Florence while it acted “front” for revolutionary modem construction. Because the ’ steel‐framed skyscraper was relatively young — a 20‐year‐old postdeb — its designers playing it safe, and so were the  wasextra strong and the were extra thick; two feet of masonry had to be ripped down where today's Codes require only a few inches. The building is an oddshape, on an odd shaped piece of land; a trapezoid that is extremely narrow for its length, with a particularly narrow end. When the wind blows on its 120‐foot long sides, there is no bulky depth behind to brace it. The stiffness of the steel must resist the The solution is special stiffening, and the result, as they did it in 1904, is pretty fancy. Triangular steel plates at each end of the beam reinforce every intersection of beams and columns on the outside walls, tQ virtually turn the frame into truss. Just to be sure, this “extra margin” is carried all around the building, not only on its critical short sides. The fancy work is further elaborated by rivets, give it a ruggedly embroidered effect. Today buildings are bolted or welded, quietly and neatly. ‘Those old, 30‐inChdeep horizontal girders were put together with separate top and bottom pieces fastened to them; they would never be used now. Girders ofthis size are rolled in ‘one piece. Bracing is done ’ now by welding the beams to the columns at the top and bottom, rather than byadding those dramatic diagonal gussets. All the principles are the same, but techniqueshave advanced, codes have been revised, and the sense of adventure that made thissuch a progressive building at the beginning of the century has moved on to other forms of construction. “We meet this kind of thing every day,” says dile, the engineer in charge of the job for the architects, Smith, Smith, Haines, Lundberg and Waehler, the archeological wonder matter‐of‐factly. “It was a fine, sturdy job, but we do it better now ”

1183-> Plante Sidelined by Infected Foot; Villemure Called Up — Ingarfield Also Lost to Rangers
CHICAGO, Jan. 16—Jacques Plante, the injury‐prone and illness‐prone goalie of the New York Rangers, is sidelined again. He stepped on a nail after a game in Toronto last night and may miss the National Hockey League game against the Chicago Black Hawks here Saturday night. The Rangers also learned that Earl Ingarfield, a center, might miss several games. He suffered a concussion earlier in the season and missed eight games. He has been wearing a plastic helmet. He complained of dizziness during the 5‐4 victory over the Maple Leafs at Toronto and has been ordered to rest. Plante's injury stunned General Manager Muzz Patrick and Coach Red Sullivan, who knew nothing about it until Plante arrived today by train. The Rangers immediately called up Gilles Villemure from Baltimore of the American Hockey League as standby goalie. Plante played well in the Toronto game. Then, in the shower room, he stepped on a nail and his right foot became infected. The foot began to swell when Plante reached Chicago. Dr. Myron Tremaine, the Black Hawks' physician, gave him tetanus and antibiotic injections and put him in Henrotin Hospital. Tremaine said Plante should show improvement in 24 to 48 hours and probably would be ready to oppose the Hawks Saturday night or Detroit on Sunday night. This is the third time this season that Villemure has been called up to relieve Plante. In the five games Villemure was in the nets, the Rangers played three ties and lost twice. The first time he was called up, Plante was out with severe asthma attacks. The second time, Plante had a bruised shoulder. Plante was to have flown to Chicago immediately after Wednesday night's game. Before he signed with the Rangers, Plante told club officials he must spend a minimum amount of time in Toronto because he is prone to asthma attacks there. “Jacques doesn't even stay in the same hotel with the rest of the players when we're in Toronto,” a club official said. “It's ironic that he stepped on a nail in Maple Leaf Gardens. It's the cleanest and bestkept indoor arena in North America,” the spokesman said. The Rangers are seeking their third straight triumph over the Hawks. The Blues won the last two times after five losses and two ties with Chicago.

1184-> CBS News Gives Evidence Of Crossovers in Indiana
WASHINGTON, May 15 (AP)—C.B.S. News has told a Congressional critic there is substantial statistical evidence that Republicans crossed over to vote for Alabama's Gov. George C. Wallace in the Indiana Democratic Presidential primary May 5. Representative Durward G. Hall, Republican of Missouri, charged in a House speech May 6, that the report of Louis Harris, a commentator, of crossover voting was unverifiable and amounted to “propaganda.” Mr. Hall inserted in The Congressional Record today a letter from C.B.S. News' president, Fred Friendly, which said that there were 14.9 per cent fewer Republican votes and 14.9 per cent more Democratic votes than in the 1960 primary. He said evidence of crossover was also found in a study of 42 individual precincts. Mr. Hall wrote back that “your explanation raises more doubts than it resolves.”

1189-> PLAYS IN 25 PARKS APPROVED BY CITY; Board of Estimate Supports Shakespearean Tours
Mayor Wagner said yesterday that citywide tours by the New York Shakespeare Festival had the support of the Board of Estimate. Mr. Wagner said, “The board is unanimous in approving this project.” The program calls for free open‐air productions next summer of Shakespeare plays in 25 city parks and playgrounds, starting with “A Midsummer Night's Dream.” The Board of Estimate must allocate $170,000 for the tour, in addition to the $100,000 it already gives each year toward the presentation of the festival's plays at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. The tour allotment will be supplemented by $35,000 already donated by George T. Delacorte, head of the Dell Publishing Company, for a mobile stage. The total of $205,000 available for the tour is to be budgeted at $100,000 for operating expenses and $105,000 for equipment. Mr. Wagner made his announcement at Gracie Mansion reception in honor of the Shakespeare Festival. Joseph Papp, founder and producer of the festival, said he had spoken to most of the borough presidents about what parks the tour should visit. He displayed a cardboard model of the portable stage and described it as “basically Elizabethan with a thrust platform.” It will have a lighting tower, for performances at any site. Robert W. Dowling, the city's cultural executive, presented certificates of achievement to Mrs. Louis K. Anspacher, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred A. Strelsin, Colleen Dewhurst and George C. Scott for their contributions to the festival. Newbold Morris, Commissioner of Parks, presented a similar citation to Mr. Delacorte. Irving Maidman, 1964 chairman of the festival, launched a drive to raise at least $250,000 to supplement the city's $100,000 for the Central Park shows.

1190-> Plant Maintenance Show Slated to Open Tomorrow
The changes in this country's manufacturing methods over the last 15 years will be illustrated when the 15th anniversary exposition of the Plant Engineering and Maintenance Show opens at the Public Auditorium in Cleveland tomorrow. Saul Poliak, president of Clapp & Poliak, Inc., producer of the show and its accompanying conference, pointed out that the plant and the maintenance engineer had risen in industrial echelons in direct proportion to the rise in the use of automatic controls. “When the show began in Cleveland 15 years ago,” he said, “it had only about 80 small booths in a single aisle. Our biggest job in those days was to convince executives that we w ould do more than show them mops, pails and oil rags. The show this year will occupy all exhibit halls, will demonstrate many of the most sophisticated systems and controls, and will bring representatives from virtually every major corporation in the country.” The show, one of the three largest annual industrial expositions in the country, will be accompanied by the Plant Engineering and Maintenance Conference, also in its 15th year.

1191-> Nuclear ‘Mutual Example’
The announcement by President Johnson in New York and Premier Khrushchev in Moscow of the American‐Soviet‐British decision to cut back production of fissionable materials is an important contribution to the lessening of international tension. It is a striking instanceof the “policy of mutual example,” that is of governments unilaterally agreeing to take similar measures in a sensitive area without the formalities of treaty negotiation. It is a welcome indication of rising mutual confidence. The planned reductions in nuclear material output have no military significance, since all three nations have more than enough uranium 235 and plutonium for any conceivable weapons needs. The United States has been producing fissionable material for two decades; the Soviet Union has been doing so at least since 1949, and Britain since the beginning of the nineteen‐fifties. It is the overkill capacity of the three nations that will grow at a slower rate because of this agreement. The hope must be that as mutual confidence increases the Soviet Government will soften its hitherto almost complete opposition to inspection on its own territory. But absence of inspection should not be the barrier to the present step that it would be to other, more important, progress toward disarmament. A reduction in the rate of nuclear materials production has long been advisable, but it has only recently seemed politically possible. It has now become possible because a new atmosphere and a new situation prevail on the world scene, including such changes as the belated recognition of the nuclear weapons stalemate and of the mutually suicidal character of Soviet‐American thermonuclear conflict, the Soviet‐Chinese split, and the joint rebellion of President de Gaulle and Mao Tse‐tung against last year's limited nuclear test‐ban treaty. President Johnson's discussion yesterday was impressive and straightforward. But, apart from the announcement about nuclear materials, it indicated little if any change in American foreign policy anywhere, nor any acknowledgment that Senator Fulbright had a point in questioning some of the assumptions on which American foreign policy has been based for twenty years ‐despite the extraordinary new conditions in the world about us.

1192-> ROCKEFELLER ENDS WEST COAST SWING; Urges Goldwater to Disown Anti‐Lodge Pamphlet
LOS ANGELES, April 2 —Governor Rockefeller ended four days of campaigning along the West Coast today with another challenge to Senator Barry Goldwater on the issue of rightwing extremism. But there was strong evidence that the New York Governor was flying home with the feeling that Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge had become an even greater threat than the Arizona conservative in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination. Mr. Rockefeller who got a warm, if not always enthusiastic, reception in both Oregon and California, struck again and again at Mr. Goldwater in a news conference here on the University of California campus and in a speech to 3,000 students. Formal and informal soundings of public sentiment indicate that he now trails the Senator, who, along with Harold E. Stassen, the former Minnesota Governor, opposes him in California's June 2 Presidential preferrential primary. The winner takes all of the state's 86 votes at the Republican National Convention at San Francisco in July. In an off‐the‐cuff statement to newsmen, Mr. Rockefeller called on the Senator to denounce a pro‐Goldwater pamphlet that implied that Mr. Lodge was “soft on Communism.” The booklet attacking the Ambassador to South Vietnam was published by the Conservative Society of America, a rightwing organization in New Orleans headed by Kent Courtney. Mr. Rockefeller held up the pamphlet when he reached the lectern in the Women's Lounge of the university's Student Union Building. He said that it had “deeply disturbed me.” He noted that one chapter was titled, “How Soft on Communism Is Henry Cabot Lodge ?” The Ambassador, the Governor said, has served in public office virtually all of his life, made significant contributions to his country and fought Communism bitterly in the United States. “I would assume and hope,” Mr. Rockefeller said, “that Senator Goldwater would denounce this kind of literature just as forcefully as I have, and that he would make it clear that, as Republicans, we stand united in supporting the basic strength, the basic principles on which our party has been built and which have contributed so importantly to the strength of freedom and the understanding of the significance of human dignity.” Turning to criticism of the Johnson Administration's foreign policy, Mr. Rockefeller contended that it was responsible for the current political upheaval in Brazil. “I think this Administration has encouraged what is known in Italy as ‘an opening to the left’ in governments throughout the world,” the Governor said, when asked to be more specific. He argued that this nation under the Democrats had encouraged the Government headed by President João Goulart, which was overthrown yesterday. Encouragement was given although the Brazilian President had placed Communists in government position in opposition to the wishes of many of Brazil's state governors, Mr. Rockefeller asserted.

1194-> Soviet Union Resumes Sale of Gold in Europe
LONDON, March 17—Sale3 of gold by the Soviet Union resumed today for the first time in 1994. About 40 metrie tons, worth about P5 million, were offered and more; is expected soon. While most of the gold was sold in Paris, part of the offerings reached London, the main European bullion center, before the bullion market here closed for the night. The sales are for delivery during April. These transactions are separate from the present deliveries of Soviet gold worth between $400 million and $500 million that was sold last year. The sales today had been expected because the main Canadian wheat shipment season will begin next month with the reopening of the St. Lawrence seaway. It is believed the money raised by Soviet gold sales last year has been nearly exhausted. The Soviet Union's foreignexchange earnings from commodity exports have shrunk. Even Soviet oil exports, it is said, have dropped sufficiently to put an end to recent pricecutting. d

1196-> ASPIRING AUTHOR FINISHES 2D BOOK; Bernard Richards Is Back With Keidansky of 1903
Bernard G. Richards, who describes himself as an “aspiring young author,” has turned over the manuscript of his second book to his agent. His first brightly philosophical work, “Discourses of Keidansky,” was published in 1903. Between books, Mr. Richards, who at 87 is the active chairman of the Jewish Information Bureau, suffered interruptions. Mr. Richards was a reporter for The Boston Post when he invented the eloquent Keidansky, a Jewish counterpart of Finley Peter Dunne's Mr. Dooley. The discourses originally appeared in The Boston Evening Transcript. Then Mr. Richards got interested in Zionist affairs. He became secretary of a council dealing with Jewish community affairs on the Lower East Side, executive secretary of the American Jewish Congress, secretary to the American Jewish delegation to the 1919 Peace Conference atVersailles, a member of the National Emergency Council in New Deal days and so on—“a jagged, broken, uneven, fortuitous and checkered career,” he says. The name of Mr. Richards's Keidansky, who also figures in his new manuscript, comes from Keidan, Lithuania, where the author was born in 1877. At 13, he followed his father to Idaho Springs, Colo., worked in the father's dry goods store for a year and then went to Boston where he hoped an uncle would stake him to a college education. “But my uncle thought ped‐ dling was just as educational as a college so that is what I did,” he said over coffee recently. A salesman in his father's store had given him a Dickens novel, and with that start he taught himself to read. When his book came out a dozen years later, published first by Scott‐Thaw and then by Brentano's, it was greeted with enthusiasm by Israel Zangwill, Max Nordau and Julien Hawthorne. Prof. Barrett Wendell of Harvard asked where this immigrant got his command of English. Keidansky's 1903 discourses read like Mr. Richards, a small, spry, blue‐eyed man with a white spearpoint of a beard, talking in 1964. Keidansky rattles along on every subject: “The good man of one age is the dead man of another. Between vice and virtue there is often no more than a change of mind. ... Why, the coat of tar and feathers is going out of fashion, and even in New England, it's no longer a crime to be happv.” Speaking recently about an organization devoted to interreligious amity, Mr. Richards went on in Keidansky style: “Goodwill has become a profession.” A hint of a smile, and he continued: “With better misunderstandings, you would again have good comedies.” Next, he was cheerfully rapping the number of moneyraising campaigns. “We did not expect the Messiah to arrive in the form of a shrill, fund‐raising. campaign manager.” However, Mr. Richards never goes on long in an iconoclastic vein. He is all for goodwill and community efforts that involve people in quiet work. His frequently voiced advice is: “To save your soul, use it often!” The Keidansky of 1903, a philosopher of the ghetto and habitue of noisy cafes, dealt with all sorts of issues from “What Constitutes the Jew?” to “On Enjoying One's Own Writings.” When he wanted a change from Boston, it showed up as my Vacation on the East Side. Salvation on East Side That was the Lower East Side of the turn of the century: “Come and spend 15 minutes on the East Side, and the salvation of humanity will be assured to you. There is so much squalor and suffering and sorrow here that nothing can overcome the optimism of these chosen people.” The new Keidansky, who has been appearing recently in Congress Weekly, journal of the American Jewish Congress, deals with topics like “Who Is a Goy?” and turns out observations like “a little assimilation is a very good thing; a lot may be fatal.” Faced with a question about intellectuals being alienated from the Jewish community, Keidansky replies tartly with advice to the whole community to go “back to the book to learn simplicity, humility, integrity.” The author, when he came to the United States, took what he said was “the unobtrusive if somewhat misleading name of Richards.” He produced a note on that subject which he had written for his proposed new book: “The choice of a patronymic on the part of groping Jewish immigrants may or may not have been wise, but they made no mistake about the selection of a country. To this blessed land and its principles and ideals, they and their offspring have pledged their everlasting fealty and affection.” Mr. Richards lives on the Upper West Side with his wife—they were married in 1905—and occasionally sees his daughter and three sons. He works regularly at the Jewish Information Bureau, does special jobs like recording his memories of famous men and moments for the oral history department at Columbia and often buys a bottle of Israeli port and of California red wine on the way home. There he gives the bottles to a maid and says the port is for his wife and the California wine “is for the common people.” The maid has come to understand that Mr. Richards, alias Keidansky, is “the common people—

1198-> NORTHERN DANCER IS RATED ODDS‐ON; Canadian Colt Draws No. 1 Post in 1⅛‐Mile Test With Shoemaker Riding
HALLANDALE, Fla., April 3 (AP)—It will be Northern Danc-er against seven of this nation's speediest 3‐year‐olds in tomorrow's 13th running of the $116,500 Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park. Northern Dancer, born at E. P. Taylor's Windfields farm near Toronto, likely will be the 1‐to‐2 favorite with the expected crowd of 25,000. The 1⅛mile run is the final major test for Derby‐age colts in Florida. Willie Shoemaker will make up most of the 122 pounds on Northern Dancer, breaking from the No. 1 post position. His chief competition is expected to come from Roman Brother, under Manuel Ycaza; Dandy K., with Mickey Solomone, and The Scoundrel, Henry Moreno riding. Also drawing support will be Ky. Pioneer, with Johnny Rotz, and Saltville, under Braulio Baeza. Outsiders are Ishkoodah, with Larry Gilligan, and Greek Episode. under Steve Brooks. The Florida Derby and trackrecord time of 1:46 4/5, set by Gen. Duke in 1957, is in danger if the track is fast, as expected. Dancer is certain to go for the early lead from his inside post position, with Greek Episode likely to charge after him. H. A. Luro, who conditions Northern Dancer, said the colt was “too sharp” and was keyed up for the race.

1199-> Art: A Show From Maine at the Whitney Museum; '63 Exhibition of Colby College Opens Here
AN extraordinarily pleasant exhibition, “Maine and Its Artists,” has reached the Whitney Museum of American Art, 22 West 54th Street, after originating last May at the Colby College Art Museum in Waterville, Me., where it was part of the college's 150th anniversary celebration. Way stops at the Portland Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston have cost it a number of pictures, reducing the total from 115 to about 80, some owners having been unwilling to make extended loans. The 80 are good enough to make one regret the losses. But perhaps it is good for New York to play second—or, in this case, fourth — fiddle for a change. The exhibition was organized under the direction of Prof. James M. Carpenter, chairman of the department of art at Colby College, with Lloyd Goodrich, director of the Whitney, among those collaborating. A generous point of view allowed a flexible definition of a Maine artist, including not only native‐borns but summer coloists, and not only distinguished portrait painters (such as Copley) who were imported to immortalize the local gentry but anonymous primitive Down Easters for whom Boston was the near limit of outer space. And yet the exhibition has an undeniable unity from its earliest examples, dating from the first decade of the 18th century, up to the moment. The last name in the alphabetically listed catalogue is Malvin Albright Zsissly, and the title of his contribution, “Maine Nostalgia,” would do nicely for just about any work in the show. Landscape — sometimes rocky, sometimes verdant, sometimes both, plus the sea —is the dominant theme, although happy, solid people are also around and about. As an informal survey of American painting over two and a half centuries, “Maine and Its Artists” does very well. The good fortune that includes such names as Winslow Homer and John Marin as legitimate Maine painters by enthusiastic adoption gives a solid historical body even though there is no way to squeeze in, for instance, Thomas Eakins. The historical character is not in the inclusion of the proper list of names from the encyclopedia but in the informal summary of successive styles, from native Americana to 20th‐century abstraction. In the latter category, however, the show peters out a bit—and rather pleasantly, as if Maine had simply decided to dispense with all that nonsense. Actually, the divorce may have come about from the opposite direction. What with air‐conditioning, there is no need for a painter to summer in Maine unless he needs the stimulation of its landscape as a point of departure. And few artists do need it, since talking has long since replaced looking as the abstract artist's creative stimulus. If this means the end of Maine as an artist's haven, then “Maine and Its Artists” is an obituary. But it has no such gloomy or retrospective air. It is a fresh, breezy, sunny show, mostly pastoral although interspersed with colorful storms. Many artists who usually don't look as good as they used to (notably Marsden Hartley) and some who are currently passé after prominence during the nineteen‐thirties, are suddenly understandable again for their merits rather than their shortcomings. “Maine and Its Artists” is an agreeable experience altogether. Ths show will remain on view until March 22, and the Whitney is open daily from 1 to 5 P.M.

1201-> ARTICLE ON OSWALD IS DISPUTED BY F.B.I.
WASHINGTON, April 24 (UPI)—J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, denied today that F.B.I. agents considered Lee H. Oswald a possible assassin he‐fore President Kennedy was slain. Mr. Hoover termed the assertion “absolutely false.” The controversy was touched off by a Texas newspaper article reporting that an F.B.I. agent, James Hosty, had told the Dallas police that the bureau had known Oswald was capable of killing the President. Mr. Hosty was said to have made the statement to Lieut. Jack Revill. However, he has denied, eVer making the statement A spokesman for the bureau said today that Mr. Hoover supported Mr. Hosty's denial But hi Sacramento, Calif., Lieutenant Revill repeated that he had heard Mr. Hosty say after Oswald's arrest that the bureau considered him a possible killer. Oswald was himself assassinated two days after he was arrested for allegedly killing Mr. Kennedy. In a copyrighted article, The Dallas Morning News quoted a source close to the Federal commission investigating the assassination. The source was quoted as saying the Dallas police chief, Jesse Curry,. had a memorandum from Lieutenant Revill containing the alleged statement of Mr. Hosty.

1202-> PROBLEM OF COST HOLDS UP FORMING OF CYPRUS FORCE; Thant Asks Contributions to Help Meet Expenses—Need Put at $6 Million; NO UNITS YET PLEDGED; Fighting Breaks Out Again—49 Hostages Released—Many Are Still Missing
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., March 7 — Questions of cost threatened today to delay the forming of the international peace‐keeping force for Cyprus. The Secretary General, U Thant, told all member nations that some of the countries he had asked to provide troops could not do so unless voluntary contributions from other states helped to meet their cost. The resolution approved unanimously by the Security Council last Wednesday specified that each country providing troops for Cyprus would pay its own expenses. It also said that the Secretary General might ask for voluntary contributions from other members. Mr. Thant is de‐pending on those voluntary contributions. Today he gave the first official estimate of costs. He said a “very tentative” figure was $6 million for the three‐month period, “to be met in cash by the United Nations through voluntary contributions.” Unofficial estimates of the total cost have run as high as $50 million for the three months. The United States has said it would give strong support in such matters as transportation, but would not contribltte cash to support the force of any other countries. Under the resolution any extension beyond the three‐month period would require a new Security Council vote. [In Cyprus, new intercommunal fighting was reported at Paphos and at other points. Forty‐nine Turkish Cypriote hostages were released at Archbishop Makarios's request. The Turks had listed 207 persons missing.] Mr. Thant said to the member states in his letter: “I shall be grateful if your. Government could make a voluntary contribution to enable me to meet these costs.” Efforts to set up the peacekeeping mission were marking time today and money appeared to be one important reason for the delay. Of six countries asked to contribute a battalion each, Brazilhas refused, chiefly on the ground of cost. Canada, Ireland Sweden all asked for further information, including cost estimates. Austria and Finland have not replied to Mr. Thant on the troop question. Instructions from their governments were awaited. The name of the civilian mediator to try to end the strife between Greek and Turkish Cypriotes had not been announced. Mr. Thant has proposed his deputy chef de cabinet, José Rolz‐Bennett of Guatemala. According to a diplomatic source, three of the countries that had to be consulted on the appointment—Britain, Cyprus and Greece—have agreed to Mr. Rolz‐Bennett. The fourth country, Turkey, was reported still awaiting instructions from Ankara. Pending general agreement, none of the parties would say anything officially on their views. Orhan Eralp of Turkey called on Mr. Thant this morning. A Turkish source said they had discussed the question of the peace‐keeping force in general terms but had not touched on the matter of the mediator. Mr. Eraip is to replace Adnan Kural, who has been ill, as chief Turkish reprsentative, but has not yet presented his credentials. The Foreign Minister of Cyprus, Spyros A. Kyprianou, also called on Mr. Thant. He said it was chiefly a farewell visit at the end of his two‐week stay here to plead his Government's case.

1203-> Electronic Picture May Guide Planes Down; F.A.A. Tests Device That Shows Pilots Runway Image
A device that draws an electronic picture of the airport runway before the pilot's eyes to guide him in obscure weather is being tested by the Federal Aviation Agency. The device projects a realistic outline of the runway, in colored light, in the pilot's field of vision. In clear weather the pilot sees the image superimposed on the actual runway. In obscure weather he sees only the image and guides himself by it. Telling him whether he is too high or too low, or too far to the left or right, is a small “path marker” symbol, resembling a tiny plane. The pilot aims this marker at the desired touchdown point like a gunsight. The device is called a windshield, or “heads‐up,” display. The F.A.A. is seeking to determine how much help the device would give pilots who may some day be landing in worse weather than planes are now permitted to land in. The present minimums are a half‐mile forward visibility and 200 feet cloud height. The goal of the agency and the industry is landings in all weather in the immediate years ahead. In very thick weather automatic flying equipment would take over all or part of the landing maneuvers. Now the pilot does this. The F.A.A. wants to know how useful the device would be as a monitor of the progress of automatic landings, or as a guidance instrument for the pilot if he suddenly had to take over and fly the plane by hand. Developed by the Sperry Gyroscope Company, the display is being tested at a Sperry plant in Carle Place, L. I. Six pilots will make a series of 1,500 simulated landings over a period of a month, testing the device in a B‐47 cockpit trainer. To provide a basis for comparison, the pilots will land using both the windshield display and conventional instrument displays. Next July 1 a similar round of tests will be conducted aloft in a twin‐engined DC‐3. The tests are due to be finished by September. The system makes use of a computer, a cathode‐ray tube and optical devices to project the images. The position of the runway in relation to the plane is determined by signals sent from the ground by existing instrument landing systems. Green bars of light form the The display, developed to insure safer landings, shows pilot (A), the horizon (B), a directional reference point (C), an image of the runway (D), an altitude indicator (E), a red path marker representing the plane and (F) markers for upper and lower air speed limits. runway and the horizon. The path marker, representing the plane, is in red. The path marker is a dot with two shoulder bars. At the left side of the path marker are three short bars that indicate whether the plane is flying at the proper speed. The center bar acts as a pointer, the others as upper and lower limits. An altitude indicator, also in green, is to the right in the display. The pilot stays on the proper glide path by maintaining alignment with the runway's center line and keeping the path marker aimed at the runway threshold. Should he decide at the last minute not to land, he lifts the plane's nose until the path marker is above the horizon. Sperry engineers cite these advantages for the windshield display: The pilot can watch the guidance display and keep an eye out for an obscured runway without turning his head or refocusing his eyes. The image is focused at infinity. Even before the runway appears, the pilot knows exactly where in the windshield frame it will come into view because the image overlays the runway outline. Seen within the image's outline, a glimpse through a hole in the clouds of a few lights or terrain may be enough to confirm the plane's alignment. Because the image is true to the perspective‐changing size, shape and position as the plane maneuvers during its approach‐following it is similar to good‐weather flying. The device can be used in clear‐weather conditions as well as instrument weather. Pilots can thus gain confidence and experience in using it when they are not under pressure. It is by no means certain that the device will become standard in airliner cockpits. The F.A.A. is testing it as a promising way of aiding low‐ visibility landings. Ways of improving existing instrument displays are also tinder study by the agency. The windshield display was originally conceived of as an aid to visual landings with high‐speed military aircraft. Sperry has been working on the concept since 1956 with Air Force, Navy and its own funds. Test versions have been flown in several military and company planes. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has contracted for a Sperry study of possible applications for spacecraft guidance.

1204-> Art Salutes the Dance
When the New York State Theater opens at Lincoln Center on April 24 with a performance by the New York City Ballet, the event will be a local climax in an art that must be nearly as old as mankind—the dance. (It may be even older than that as a natural impulse, since some animals engage in their own forms of it.) As a visual spectacle, dancing can be the most brilliant of the arts, an art of motion that literally brings to life the line and color of painting and the three‐dimensional patterns of sculpture—not to mention the sound of music. But if it is the most brilliant of the visual arts, dancing is also the most transient, enduring only for the successive instants of performance. On these pages are some examples of the ways in which painters spanning 2,500 years have tried to distilI, capture and hold the essence of its fleeting beauty.

1205-> Prof. Henry M. Sheffer, 80, Long on Harvard's Faculty
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 17—Dr. Henry Maurice Sheffer, emeritus professor of philosophy at Harvard University, died today at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. He was 80 years old. Dr. Sheffer, who attended the Boston Latin School and Harvard, where he received a Ph.D. in 1908, was a pioneer in mathematicallogic. In 1913 he was credited with a simplification of thefoundations of logic as presented in Whitehead and Russell's “Principia Mathematica.” He also developed the theories of notational relativity and preassertional logic. Dr. Sheffer was on the Harvard faculty from 1916 to 1952, and was named a philosophy professor in 1938.

1206-> CATHOLIC PUPILS PRAY WITH RABBI; Interfaith Seminar Opened at Brooklyn High School
A group of seniors in a Roman Catholic high school in Brooklyn bowed their heads yesterday as they were led in prayer by an Orthorox rabbi. Later, the rabbi, Dr. Kurt Klappholz, told them: “Some of you, perhaps, never met a rabbi before. You may have expected to meet someone with earlocks and speaking Yiddish.” “You may have wondered why I’m not wearing a yarmulka,” he said, and explained that he had decided not to wear the skull cap because of the nature of the occasion. “It isn’t important what you wear. It's important what you are.” Dr. Klappholz, vice president of the Brooklyn Board of Rabbis and rabbi of Congregation Tifereth Israel, was clean‐shaven and wearing a dark business suit. He was participating in the first session of a three‐day interfaith seminar sponsored by Xaverian High School, 71st Street and Shore Road, in the Bay Ridge section. Others who spoke were Msgr. Gregory Abboud, North American Vicar General of the Syrian Orthodox Church and dean of St. Nicholas Cathedral in Brooklyn; the Rev. Darrell Helmers, pastor of Bethlehem Lutheran Church, also in Brooklyn, and the Rev. James J. DiGiacomo, a Jesuit, who is chairman of the religion department at the Brooklyn Preparatory School. They were welcomed to the boys school byBrother Merle of the Xaverian order, who is chairman of the school's religion department and moderator for the seminar; by Brother Thomas More, a provincial of the order, and the Rev. Brother Medard, principal of the school. Dr. Klappholz, delivering the opening prayer in the school library, where the seminar was held, said: “May our project, the interfaith seminar, be in the name of the Lord who has created heaven and earth, amen.” In his remarks, Dr. Klappholz said: “I don’t want to convert you to Judaism and I don’t want you to convert me to Christianity.” He paused and then added: “You wouldn’t make any headway, anyway.” There was a roar of laughter from the boys. Then the rabbi said: “Let each of us worship Godin his own way.” Monsignor Abboud urged the audience to “get the understanding of all people — particularly the people we’re living with — regardless of religion, color or race.” Mr. Helmers observed critically that some persons attended church on Sundays and left without obtaining real guidance on racial integration, the need for better education and other issues. Father DiGiacomo raised the question of whether there was “anything in the way we’ve been taught our faith that seems to isolate us from others.” “Perhaps we are so intent on preserving our purity of doctrine that we are taught somehow that we are different,” he said. During the discussion the 57 boys listened attentively, sometimes taking notes. The group's average I.Q. is above 140, and attendance at the seminar was voluntary, Brother Medard said. Brother Merle noted that the students hadn’t stirred, “even when the lunch bell rang.” One student said: “I liked the rabbi. He really spoke his mind.” A Catholic seminar spokesman said he expected that the meeting would draw disapproval in some conservative Catholic circles.

1211-> ROCKEFELLER ENTRY ON COAST IN DOUBT
LOS ANGELES, April 3 —some uncertainty about whether Governor Rockefeller of New York qualified for California's primary ballot on Junne 2 lingered tonight as the deadline passed for filing nominating petitions. The answer will not be known until next week. State election laws require that one‐half of 1 per cent of the vote amassed by the party's last candidate for Governor—13,702 signatures of registered voters—be filed with voting registrars among the state's 58 counties in the 30 days that ended tonight. Supporters of Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona complied with this requirement through a whirlwind statewide signature campaign on March 4, the first day for petition circulation. The Rockefeller organization contracted this normally routine chore to a commercial canvassing organization in Los Angeles, which protracted the work throughout the month. California Secretary of State Frank Jordan said tonight he had in hand only about 6.000 validated pro‐Rockefeller signatures—less than half the needed number. Rockefeller campaign aides said they were confident that more than enough signatures had been collected throughout the state. County registrars have until next Wednesday to screen the petitions and get them to the secretary of state.

1217-> East River Pier Blaze Fought by Land and Water
Wooden pilings beneath Pier 34 at Rutgers Slip on the East River burned for 90 minutes yesterday, forcing five men working on the pier to flee. Two fireboats and three Coast Guard utility boats joined land companies in battling the blaze. One person, Fire Lieut John O'Shea, was hurt. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital for treatment of a neck injury. Traffic on the elevated part of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Drive and on South Street below, was stopped from 11:55 A.M., when the fire broke out, until it was declared under control at 1:30 P.M. General cargo on the 1,000 ‐ by ‐ 200 ‐ foot frontage pier, which is leased from the city by the New York Central Railroad, was slightly damaged. Most of the damage was confined to the wooden understructure of the pier, which is one of the many on the East River scheduled for eventual demolition.

1218-> Drivers in 3,190‐Mile East African Safari Pelted by Stones and Torches; 3 CARS DAMAGED IN GRUELING TRIP; Windshields Are Shattered —63 of 94 Starters to Make Final Run
NAIROBI, Kenya, March 28 (AP)—The 63 surviving cars in the 3,190‐mile East African Safari were scheduled to start the southern leg of the race latetoday, with British Ford Cortinas holding four of the first five places. The race will finish in Nairobi Monday. Of the 94 cars that started, 31 dropped out during therugged northern leg, which included driving through areas where Africans threw rocks and burning torches at the drivers. Three cars had shattered windshields. At other points along the route, logs and boulders apparently had been placed deliberately. Drivers said the rock‐throwing appeared to be unorganized and was mostly done by youths and children. The husband and wife team of Erik and Pat Moss Carlsson driving Swedish Saabs, were the only ones in any position to challenge the Cortinas. Carlsson is third, and his wife sixth. Mike Armstrong and Chris Bates of Kenya are the leaders. Only one of the six highpowered Ford‐Lincoln Comets is still in the running. It is 27th, with the team's No. 1 driver, Viscount Kim Mandeville, at the wheel. Four other Comets are at the tail end of the field and one has quit.

1219-> CHIARI APPLAUDS PANAMA'S GUARD; Ceremony Hints President Retains Firm Backing
PANAMA, Jan. 31—President Roberto F. Chiari received a reaffirmation of the National Guard's loyalty today at a reception for its chief officers in the presidential palace. President Chiari gave the reception to show appreciation for the guard's services during the rioting that erupted Jan. 9 on the border of the Canal Zone. Col. Bolivar Vallarino was commended by the President for the guard's conduct. The rioting, directed against the United States, began when Panamanian students entered the Canal Zone to raise the Panamanian flag beside the American one. United States troops fired on the crowds, and Panama later broke diplomatic relations with Washington. With political pressures intense in both capitals, mediators have failed to resolve the dispute. Panama has demanded that the United States promise publicly to renegotiate the 1903 treaty governing the Panama Canal and the Canal Zone. Coup Rumors Rebutted Today's reception served to offset mounting rumors of an impending coup d'etat. During crises in Panama, the head of the National Guard can be the decisive power in determining the Government's fate. According to his associates, Colonel Vallarino was asked to name his price for assisting in the overthrow of two previous presidents and even in the elimination of the presidency. But according to these associates he rebuffed every suggestion, declaring that his military organization was dedicated to constitutional government. At the ceremony, the ranking officers of the 3,000‐member guard were joined by Max Arosemena, Minister of the Interior and Minister of Justice. Mr. Arosemena, speaking with foreign observers, concurred with Colonel Vallarino in discrediting rumors of an overthrow of the Government. The Interior Minister, who is in charge of internal security. said that all was tranquil and that rumors of an overthrow had originated in Washington and were being spread in Panama from the Canal Zone. The minister and the colonel also discounted rumors that an rmed militia was roaming the hills of the interior and engagng in guerrilla activity. “The tional Guard is the only armed organization in Panama,” Colonel Vallarino said. Leftists’ Role Discounted Mr. Arosemena conceded that leftist elements were at work in Panama, but hie said, “None of these elements held a place of direction in the events of Jan. 9, 10 and 11.” Despite the assurance of tranquility from the presidential Palace, rumors persisted of inpending; action by Panamanians against the Canal Zone. Yesterday the zone prepared for a Panamanian labor boycott, but today labor leaders dismissed talk of a boycott as leftist propaganda. Nevertheless the zone's authorities maintained that the threat had been real, and repressentatives were sent to prominent Panamanians, asking them to intervene with the National Guard. The guard assured the zone that any attempt to prevent Panamanian workers from reporting to work in the zone would be broken up. some employes in the Canal Zone, particularly at the Gorgag Hospital, were asked to remain in the zone over the week‐ In view of reports of a emonstration against the United States’ control of the zone, security measures were being tightened, an official said today.

1220-> Chicago Boycott Fought
CHICAGO, Feb. 4—Powerful old‐line Negro forces within Mayor Richard J. Daley's political machine are organizing to fight a school boycott that young militant leaders have set for Feb. 25. As signs of rising tension multiplied today in both the Negro and white sections of Chicago over the racial composition of the school system, leaders of the boycott moveent here were pointing to New York City, where 360,000 students—almost a third of the city's total—stayed out yesterday. They held that the success of the New York walkout should be a warning to Chicago's school board and City HalI. But Negro leaders in Mayor Daley's camp are passing the word on the boycott to the precinct levels: “Stop it” On the southwest side, white parents opposed to the transfer of pupils to predominantly Negro schools also banded together, and proposed a march on city hall and a “tax strike,” with property owners refusing to pay the real estate tax installment due May 1. Mayor Daiey previously has kept out of school board matters. However, he has offered to act as a mediator in an attempt to prevent the threatened boycott. Privately, boycott leaders doubt that he will offer enough concessions to prevent the boycott. But they have said that pending his offer the boycott is being “held in abeyance.” A test is shaping up of the allegiance of the 900,000 Negroes in Chicago, who regularly turn in tremendous majorities for the Democratic party at the polls. The word was out that Representative William Dawson, the powerful leader of the Negro Democratic machine, had ordered an anti‐boycott campaign. One of the leaders is Alderman Kenneth E. Campbell, Mr. Dawson's political heir apparent. Besides “passing the word,” Mr. Campbell has circulated 13,000 petitions — he calls them “pledges” — saying, “Help stop the school boycott . . . your children need all the education they can get.” The Chicago branches of the National Association for the Advancement of CoIored People and the Urban League have also opposed the boycott here. The strongly pro‐boycott Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee has called the Rev. Zilton A. Galamison, a leader of the New York boycott to a rally here Thursday.

1221-> ART NOTES: PICASSO'S PRINCIPLE
The Spanish Government's recent purchase from a Paris gallery of three works by Picasso for exhibit at its New York World's Fair pavilion has had no effect whatever on Picasso's feelings about the Franco regime, according to recent word from Douglas Cooper, the British art critic and historian who is one of Picasso's closest friends. “As long as Franco is in power, Picasso will not set foot in Spain,” says Mr. Cooper. The Spanish Government has made a number of overtures toward the self‐exiled painter in recent years. He bears a Spanish passport and has been informed that his visit to Spain would be warmly welcomed. But, although there are a number of Picassos in Spanish museums, this is believed to be the first time that the present Government has actually gone out shopping for his work. In choosing to honor its native prophet at the Fair, some observers have noted, the Spanish Government is not unaware of Picasso's box‐office attraction. At long last, Mexico City is about to get its Diego Rivera Museum, begun by the artist shortly before his death in 1956 and intended to house his huge (16,000 pieces) collection of archaeological treasures. A 4‐story pyramid made of lava slabs, it's designed in a style known to the artist as “Aztec, Mayan and Rivera Traditional,” and located in the lava beds on the city's outskirts. The design has been completed by Rivera's good friend, the noted architect Juan O'Gorman. Cartoons and paintings by Rivera and his late wife, Frida Kahlo, will be displayed in a studio portion of the museum, while 2,000 of the artifacts will be housed in other sections of the structure. The rest will be stored for exhibition in a warehouse also designed by O'Gorman. The Museum's board, originally named by Rivera in his will and since augmented, reads like a Mexican Who's Who of the arts and sciences. It's headed by a businesswoman, Senora Dolores 01medo, representing the artconscious Bank of Mexico, which advanced 600,000 pesos for the project's completion. Even though the museum is finished, Senora Olmedo hasn't yet fixed on a date for formal opening. That may wait until the installation of a new Mexican President next year offers occasion for a fiesta. From London last week came word that the Tate Gallery's famed director, Sir John Rothenstein, had announced his plans for retirement. “About Sir John,” said the Daily Telegraph, “one thing is certain. He will be remembered as one of the great gallery directors of our time.” In his un‐tranquil tenure of 26 years, Sir John has transformed the dreary old Tate into one of Europe's liveliest museums. He built up the permanent collection from 2,700 to 5,000 works, encouraging such outrageously modern British artists as Hepworth, Nicholson and Moore. From Tate cellars, he rescued a series of great, timeblackened Turner canvases and restored them as a national treasure. And he helped persuade a penny‐pinching British Treasury to put out purchase grants that now amount to $228,000 a year. As tangible proof of Sir John's success, the Tate can point to its attendance. 25 years ago, it's said, Tate guards spun idle turnstiles to “clock up” fake figures. Now, the gallery draws some 1,250,000 a year‐more visitors than any gallery in Europe. With his new leisure Sir John, who has already pro‐ duced “maybe two dozen” books, will concentrate on writing. Since there's no obvious candidate for his job, the Government, with due Civil Service propriety, will hold an “open competition.” The salary? $10,360 a year. Recognizing the increasing demand for art exhibition catalogues, those scholarly, sometimes lavishly printed records of museum and gallery shows, a free‐lance editor named Eva Kroy Wisbar has recently founded the Worldwide Art Catalogue Centre. Aiming to keep catalogues in circulation (and out of museum basements) once a show is over, Worldwide acts as a sort of catalogue clearing house for museums and galleries throughout the world. It keeps track of upcoming shows, orders catalogues for customers from about 300 (so far) cooperating institutions, and issues quarterly bulletins that serve as art catalogue bibliographies for museums, scholars, libraries and collectors. Worldwide now has more than 2,000 titles on tap. What's more, it's now getting catalogues from behind the Iron Curtain (Yugoslavia and Hungary; not Russia yet). “The biggest surprise to Europeans,” says Mrs. Wisbar, “are American catalogues, which are beginning to equal Europe's finest. We're getting more and more requests for them from abroad.” Happenings in Your Home, a new service devised by a pair of young artists named Al Hansen and Wolf Vostell, is now in its third week and going strong. As one result of an ad placed in the Village Voice, Mr. Vostell has already staged a Home Happening for Dr. Richard Huelsenbeck, a founder of the Dada movement. Dr. Huelsenbeck (now a N. Y. psychiatrist) got a type of Happening at which Mr. Vostell excels ‐ a décollage. Décollage to Mr. Vostell means “taking apart,” and what he did was to fiddle with the controls of a TV set, breaking up the picture in various ways. To accompany the series of fractured images, he played rock 'n roll. This lasted for an hour, and Dr. Huelsenbeck says he wasvery pleased. Mr. Hansen, who has made some 40 collages from Hershey bar wrappers (and keeps making them‐they sell like crazy at the Leo Castelli Gallery) will do a series of Monday night Happenings at the East End Theater starting May 4. He explains that he and Mr. Vostell do Happenings for joy, not profit, and only charge for carfare and materials. Mr. Hansen would like to try his luck next in upper‐income Westchester, which he thinks might turn out to be solid Happening country. Four new galleries have recently made bows, two uptown, two downtown: Tasca and Dorsky, both 888 Madison Ave.; Alice Nash, 104 Christopher Street; Tarot, 22 Astor Place ... To help celebrate Pan American week, the Pepsi‐Cola Exhibition Gallery, 500 Park Avenue, will mount “New Personalities in Latin‐American Art,” April 15‐May 5... Everett Ellin, formerly Co‐Director of the Marlborough‐Gerson Gallery, has been named Officer in Charge of Public Affairs at the Guggenheim Museum... A recent press release from the Seamen's Bank says artists can save high gallery costs by exhibiting in bank windows, goes on to note “a small deposit in the savings and checking department is suggested but not mandatory.” ... You have to go way back these days to stay avant‐garde: at Bennington College, a Maxfield Parrish Show opens May 5.

1222-> Chicago Girl, 10, Gives Birth To a Five‐Pound Daughter
CHICAGO, Feb. 12 (UPI)—A 10‐year‐old girl gave birth today to a 5‐pound 15‐ounce girl, her attending physician reported. Dr. Carlo A. Fioretti said the birth was by Caesarean section. The mother is a fourth‐grade pupil. It was believed she would not see her baby, who was to be sent to St. Vincent's orphanage as soon as possible hospital administrators said. Medical sources said a 9‐yearold Arkansas girl was believed to be the youngest mother on record in the United States. She gave birth to a 2½‐pound boy in 1957. A 5‐year‐old girl was delivered of a son by Caesarean section in Peru in 1939. Authorities refused to reveal the name of the mother, who has named a 16‐year‐old boy as the father. The boy is undergoing psychiatric tests.

1223-> A Shelf of Shakespeare for the Layman
HE Shakespearean kite that is flying so high this year trails a lengtheningtail of books and essays written to commem‐ orate the 400th anniversary of the poet's birth. No one will have the time to read all of these 2,000 or more works. Indeed, it is a safe bet that no library in the world will secure and give shelf space to all the Shakespearean publications of 1964. And no library has all of the 75,000 or more books and articles already printed about the dramatic genius from Stratford‐upon‐Avon. Yet a literate man wants and needs in his library a few books to increase his enjoyment of Shakespeare in the study and on the stage. What may he conside a reasonable nucleus ? A good starting point will be subscriptions to (1964 special issue: Cambridge, $9.50), a single‐volume, hardcover annual, and (Shakespeare Association of America, 322 East 57th Street, New York 22, $8 per year). These provide a variety of essays in interpretation and also reports of the Shakespeare festivals, and (in S.Q.) dependable reviews and the best annual Shakespeare bibliography. Both are generously illustrated. There is no altogether satisfactory biography of Shakespeare. The most readable is still (Houghton Mifflin, $6.25) by Joseph Q. Adams, though it is unavoidably outof‐date on certain topics. A just account is also to be found scattered throughthe chapters of Alfred Harbage's (Farrar, Straus, cloth, $6.95; Noonday, paper, $2.75), which gives valuable help in the understanding of Shakespeare's diction and metrics and of Elizabethan stage conventions. Marchette Chute's (Dutton, cloth, $5.95; Everyman, paper, $1.65) provides a matter‐of‐fact background for the playwright in the persons of his friends and fellow actors, John Heminges and Henry Condell, “good men and true,” both of them substantial citizens and church wardens, whose loyalty in bringing out the First Folio gained them immortality. (Hill & Wang, $5) by Ivor Brown touches on many easily overlooked aspects of the hectic life of a man of the theater, regardless of his century. (Cornell, $6) is a useful volume. It includes a dozen of the richly illustrated Folger Shakespeare   “ 400:   ” Library booklets, by various authors, on Shakespeare's biography, the Elizabethan theater and dramatic tradition, authorship, and related topics. There is a wealth of information readably presented in Karl J. Holzknecht's  (American Book,$6.50), a volume planned for collegiate use. Margaret Webster's (Premier, paper, 60 cents) is recommended for the verve with which the author, theatrical to her fingertips, writes of the playwright she loves best. (2 vols., Princeton, $6 each), by Harley Granville‐Barker, has an even stronger theatrical background and has exercised a benificent influence on both actors and scholars. The Elizabethan point of view in matters historical and philosophical is sketched in  (Macmillan, paper, $1.50) by Theodore Spencer and   (Vintage, paper, $125), by E. M. W. Tillyard. What Shakespeare found in books and how he used it will be better understood with the guidance of Virgil K. Whitaker's (Henry E. Huntington Library, $6.50) and Madeleine Doran's (Wisconsin, $7.50). And future readings of the plays will be a vastly enriched experience for those who are conversant with (Nebraska‐Bison, paper, $1.60) by E. A. Armstrong. Shakespeare's diction and his delight in earthy word‐play are amusingly treated by Eric Partridge in (Everyman, paper, $1.35). There is no single look about “Venus and Adonis” and “The Rape of Luicrece”; the Sonnets have a flourishing literature. John Dover Wilson's (Cambridge, $2.75), a fair statement of facts and hypotheses, does not quite persuade me to aban‐ don the Earl of Southampton for the Earl of Pembroke as the probable Fair Youth. by Edward Hubler (Hill & Wang‐Dramabooks, paper, $1.25) justifies its title and opens new vistas. Somewhere there should be space for A. C. Bradley's (St. Martin's, cloth, $4.75; Meridian, paper, $1.65), which is less outmoded than people thought 10 years ago. Those buildings nobody knows, the Elizabethan and Jacobean playhouses, continue to be a battleground for scholars. Almost antipodal views are expressed by John Cranford Adams in (Barnes & Noble, $8.50) and C. Walter Hodges in (Saifer, $10). Those who want to plunge more deeply into the Heliconian fountains should provide themselves with E. K. Chambers's : A Study of Facts and Problems (2 vols., Oxford, $12.50) and W. W. Greg's (Oxford University Press, $2.90).

1226-> SOLD‐OUT TOWN HALL HEARS SEGOVIA PLAY
In 1909 Andrés Segovia first appeared on the concert stage. In 1928 he and a New York concert audience met for the first time. Next month the world's most popular classical guitarist will be 70 years old and he is still greeted by soldout houses for his annual New York concerts. His first local concert of the season was held last night at Town Hall. Segovia's following last night was not made up, for the most part, of veterans of his original or his New York debut. The audience was a young one. He continues to fascinate and attract new generations of concert‐goers. Playing with an absolutely deadpan facial expression and with extremely eloquent hands on his guitar, he has, within the tiny dynamic range of his instrument, the variety of colors and emphasis of a full orchestra, applied with quiet, but extreme virtuosity. As usual, he offered a small taste of old music, by Bach and Roncalli. But the really idiomatic pieces were by Ponce, Al and, written especially for Segovia, works of Torroba and Turina. There was also the first New York performance of Mompou's “Suite Compostelana,” moderately adventurous with 20th‐century dissonance, and moderately successful with it.

1227-> SOCIALISTS IN ITALY FORM PARTY OF LEFT
ROME, Jan. 11—The national convention of about 750 LeftWing Socialists gave formal approval today to a motion to form a party based on “traditional” Socialist principles, including opposition to “military blocs, armaments and imperialism.” The new party, to be known as the Italian Socialist Proletarian Unity party, grows out of a split in the Socialist party over Socialist participation in the center‐left coalition Government led by Premier Aldo Moro. Mr. Moro is political secretary of the dominant Christian Democratic party. The coalition also includes the Democratic Socialist party and the Republicans. Deputy Tullio Vecchietti of Rome was elected to lead the new party. Mr. Vecchietti, with 37 other Socialist members of Parliament, was suspended from the Socialist party for failing to support the coalition Government when it sought, and won, a vote of confidence. The assembly elected a 121man National Council that, in turn, elected a directorate of 19 people, 13 of them members of Parliament.

1228-> Chess:; Positional Play Smothers Rough ‐ and ‐ Tumble Artist
PAUL BRANDTS of New York, following the example of Bobby Fischer, made ta clean sweep against strong opposition in the Central Atlantic Open Championship held last week at the Henry Hud-son Hotel. In this six‐round Swiss system in which 164 players participated, Brandts' 6‐0 score topped his nearest rivals, Larry Gilden of Takoma Park, Md., James Sherwin of New York and Bernard Zuckerman of Brooklyn, by ½ point. Brandts, who is an exchampion of the Manhattan Chess Club and the former Atlantic States Open champion, achieved a dogged, poitionally conceived win over the resolute and imaginative Dr. Ariel Mengarini of New York. Basically a profound strategist, Brandts was well aware of the tactical virtuosity of his opponent. Hence, he avoided rough‐and‐tumble combinative motifs. On the black side of a King's Gambit Declined, Brandts reached equality with 10 . . . Q‐Q3. After 17 O‐O‐O. however, Black's hold on the King Bishop file, particularly his command of his KB5, enabled him to create a threeto‐two pawn majority on the king's wing. This was a definite threat to White's security, as White's majority on the other wing was contained and innocuous. White tried to break the fetters with 23 P‐KR4, but the attempt was immediately stymied by 23 ... P‐N5. All the simplifications that followed increased Black's winning chances. Besides, a type of game followed that lacked tactical plays for White, who, willy‐nilly, was completely on the defensive, a style psychologically wrong for Mengarini. Black's ultimate whittling process, 26 . . . R‐K1; 27 RxRch. QxR, did not relinquish his king bishop pawn because of a tailend mate   Oscar Oberon of Nassau and Dr. Bernard Paul of Westbury engaged in a stoutly fought Sicilian Defense in the recent Long Island Industrial League team matches. The game reached its climax with 23 . . . R‐Q4. Up to here, the play revolved about the attack and defense of White's isolated king pawn. But White's sharp 24 N-N5 disclosed a pitfall Black had dug for himself in neglecting the security of his king. After that, Black had a sorry alternative with 24 . . . NxP; 25 RxN, RxR; 26 QxPch. K‐R1; 27 NxP, RxN; 28 QxR, when White would win easily. Earlier, White's 15 P‐K5 was nicely timed and opened up the game in White's favor. Though the move itself was not finally decisive and, in fact, incurred a weakening of his pawns, it projected central tactical threats of sufficient importance to keep Black from undertaking a dangerous counter on the queen side.

1229-> Tunisia: A Nation Transformed; A Moderate Attitude Produces Gains in Many Sectors; Seizure of Land Is Avoided in Plan for Reform
TUNIS —Flying across the highlands from Algeria to Tunis, the visitor quickly sees a transformation: Almost every hill on the Tunisian side of the border is carefully terraced against erosion and planted with young trees. In many areas, after seven years of independence from France, the pragmatic “Tunisian way” began to show results last year that most African nations, including Tunisia's neighbors. could envy. President Habib Bourguiba's regime has adopted “socialism” (the African catchword), but without xenophobia or handme‐down Marxist slogans. Although paternalistic, the oneparty Neo‐Destour Government is not corrupt or lazy. Above all, it looks before it leaps. If Algeria's professed model is Cuba, Tunisia's might be said to be Sweden. This moderate approach was applied this year to the Tunisian version of agrarian reform and modernization. Since independence, most of 250,000 hectares (about 625,000 acres) of formerly Frenchowned land has been bought by the Tunisian Government, not seized outright as was done in Algeria. In September, 1962, after a year's study and discussion, the first 15 “cooperatives” or “units of production” were organized. They grouped both Tunisian smallholders, who kept their land, and state‐owned former French farms. This formula at year's end covered close to 35,000 acres. It provides housing for technical assistance, pooled farm machinery, easy Government credit and, eventually, special schools and health facilities, for each “unit of production.” The biggest co‐op groups 60 families. Cramped by shortages of technicians and co‐op managers, the Tunisians do not expect to move ahead at a gallop. But they consider co‐ops vital for increasing farm production and bringing the illiterate Tunisian fellah into the 20th century. All this is part of a 1962–64 plan for development begun after the post‐independence struggle for economic stability. The Bourguiba regime favors planning, state initiative and semi‐public ventures rather than state ownership. The 1962–64 plan called for the following: ¶A 38 per cent increase in output from the level of 1961, a low‐yield drought year. ¶An increase in annual investment from about $151 million to about $288 million. ¶An increase in savings from $84 million to $187.2 million. ¶A maximum effort to make Tunisia self‐sufficient in textiles, sugar and food, among other things. ¶Continued austerity through price and wage controls, a cutback in luxury imports and strict currency controls. According to a United States Government report, “progress has been impressive.” One American estimate is that Tunisians are meeting 88 per cent of their rather ambitious goals. There are pledges of $118 million in non‐American foreign capital assistance. Fourteen nations, including the Soviet Union and Sweden, are supplying aid here. Moreover, the United States has made Tunisia its No. 1 aid recipient in Africa, with about $180 million pledged in loans for the 1963–65 year. The 195762 aid total comes to $234 million in loans, grants and surplus food. Some of the results are striking. The literacy rate has climbed to 30 per cent despite an annual population increase of 2.2 per cent. School enrollment has risen to 575,000, more than 60 per cent of those eligible. The number of teachers has nearly doubled, to around 10,000, in five years. More than a thousand persons join the ranks of university graduates every year. Although drought hurt the wheat crop and plummeting prices affected olive oil revenue, Tunisian productivity in most farm sectors has climbed. About 300,000 men—virtually all the jobless Tunisians—are working at least part‐time on soil conservation and other projects. Their wages are 45 cents a day plus United States surplus food. Yet Tunisians have also inevitably run into troubles. The new sugar refinery at Bejea has shut down temporarily for lack of high‐quality beets. Peasant incomprehension and a shortage of cadre are causing difficulties in some “units of production,” notably in the Enfida. One of Tunisia's big problems continues to be her balance of payments. In the first eight months of 1963 imports were up 5 per cent. Her trade deficit was $67.2 million, a sum roughly equal to half the value of her imports.

1231-> A Reader's Report
(YoseI loff, $4.50), an English novelist named Alexander Baron brings onstage a character who is looking for room at the top the hard way. He is a gambler. Harry —“Harryboy” — Boas plays the dogs, the flats, craps, cards, anything. (“I am full of knots that are going to get tighter and tighter unless I put the money on. But there is also the exulting certainty that this is victory, this is the last skyline and the Big Rock Candy Mountain is in front of me.”) When Harryboy hasn't got a stake, he works a couple of months as a garment presser; when he is ahead, he buys sets of Zola or maybe Dreiser in the second‐hand bookshops, and holes up in his bed‐sitter in Hackney, reading. Once Harryboy breaks his routine to take a job as rent collector for a madame who owns some slum houses, but this is a philanthropic endeavor from which he emerges, as usual, a heavy loser. It may be evident from the above that Mr. Baron has melded the working class novel with a touch of the picaresque, or with as much of the picaresque as realism will allow. It is an eff t mixture. Harryboy is a solid character, a Jewish sharpie with an intellectual streak and a weakness for the quixotic gesture. His background is made equally tangible by Mr. Baron, who can evoke in a pungent sentence or two, the qualitative difference between Hackney and White‐chapel. Since it is Harry's luck to be a habitual loser, it is consistent that his human relationships should be as luckless as his gambling. When the Deaners move into his tenement, he is sucked into a friendship that is highly ambivalent. Vic Deaner, a struggling bookkeeper, admires what he imagines is Harry's success. Vic's wife, Evelyn, distrusts the gambler but uses him as an unpaid baby sitter. Four‐year‐old Gregory finds in Harryboy a father substitute who has time to go on boat rides in the afternoon. The culmination of all this is at once comic and touching. The mood, as Captain Ten Eyck brings his rusty tramp freighter into the palm‐fringed harbor, Safu‐Turuu, is vaguely Conradian, but the idiom is the bang‐bang rhetoric of the adventure tale — a combination which Max Catto exploits quite effectively throughout (Morrow, $3.95). The captain is a pensive, overweight hero who has spent 30 years cruising around the South Pacific without ever coming to moral terms with the languorous social code of the islands. He remains a Dutch puritan. whose conscience is refreshed by bringing supplies to Christ Island. a Schweitzer‐like outpost conducted by a French physician and two Catholic priests. Things come to a proper boil on the author's atoll Eden when a naval task force converges on it with nuclear rocketry on the agenda. (“The Navy Records say this island isn't Inhabited.”) The moral crisis is underlined by the performance of an exforeign legionnaire known as Red, who has become a passenger of Ten Eyck's through some wild huggermugger that won't be disclosed here. Red's instincts are amoral and homicidal, and his behavior on a doomed island dedicated to brotherly love is the gist of a fast‐moving fable. It is very hard to envision the climate of Paris just after the war. You have, as they say, to have been there. Arthur Kaplan was evidently there, and he tries, in (Dutton, $3.95), to tell how it was with the boys who went native on the G.I. Bill, studying French or art and some times even going to an occasional class. Mr. Kaplan can turn a nice comic phrase; yet there is something about his collection of vignettes akin to the army stories that convulse old buddies and leave strangers blank. Mainly, I think, “Hotel de la Liberte” has come along a decade too late. I, for one, find it impossible to get into the merry Marion Hargrovish spirit that Mr. Kaplan revives about ex‐servicemen cutting up in the good old Marshall‐Plan days. For those who may be more nostalgically inclined, though, there are stories here about such as Acey Tevis, who enrolled in a life class with only one thing on his mind; Benn Dalton, who would do anything for a hot shower; Beatrice from Burbank, who brought chunky peanut butter to Montmartre; Homer McMahon, who dis ed that he had fallen in love with a Com‐‐‐ist, etc. It's good innocuous fun.

Or Lee Farquhar. the aristocratic businessman from Montclair, N.J., whom Lisa met at one of her at‐home poetry recitals? One of these will be (Appleton‐Century, $4.50), but, by jingo, Lisa almost winds up with the wrong fellow in Elizabeth Corbett's novel, before she comes to her senses, picks up the phone and we hear her say: I've been waiting for you all my life, and I never knew it until now. Come quickly!” “Cradling her own phone,” continues the author, “Lisa fought down a crowding sense of unreality.” I know the feeling.

1232-> Chicago Seeks to Bar Boycott
CHICAGO, Feb. 10—Federal District Judge Abraham L. arovitz and Mayor Richard J. Daley sought today to stave off a second boycott of Chicago public schools, scheduled for Feb. 25. Judge Marovitz called an emergency meeting between civil rights leaders and school officials to be held tomorrow in his ofice in private. “If I had authority,” the judge said, “I would enter an injunction against those who are directing this boycott.” Judge Marovitz took cognizance of the threatened boycott during a pre‐trial conference in suit by Negro parents over alleged school segregation in Chicago. He said the boycott should not be held until the suit was settled. Thomas M. Thomas, attorney for the Board of Education, sai he could see no barrier to Judge arovitz's issuing a boycott injunction pending trial of the suit. The Mayor discussed the boycott today with two aldermen, Kenneth E. Campbell and Claude W. B. Holman. both Negroes, who are leading a drive in Negro wards to get parents not to join in the school walkout. The aldermen contend that support of the boycott among parents is lacin;. The Mayor said after the meeting that he agreed with the aldermen's campaign. Civil rights leaders called the first Chicago boycott which kept about 225,000 students away from School for a day last October, a great success.

1236-> MINISTERS DEFER MALAYSIA ACTION; New Nation Asks Indonesia For Statement of Aims
BANGKOK, Thailand, Feb. 8— The Foreign Ministers of Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia made another attempt today to find some measure of agreement on how to settle their dispute over the new Federation of Malaysia. They, postponed until tomorrow final arrangements for policing the cease‐fire along Indonesia's border with Sarawak and Sabah in northern Borneo. At the end of the morning's meeting at the residence of Thanat Khoman, Thailand's Foreign Minister, who is host to the conference, the three ministers said they had made “some progress.” Conference sources emphasized later that no basis for an agreement on a formula for a general settlement had been established. The Malaysian negotiators were reported to have told Indonesia and the Philippines that there could be no settlement unless Indonesia acknowledged Malaysia's territorial integrity and accepted her national sovereignty. Informants said the Malaysians pressed Indonesia to state exactly what she wanted in regard to Malaysia. The reply, conference sources said, was that Indonesia wanted a Malaysia created not by the British but by “Asians, with Indonesia's help and the help of the Philippines.” The Indonesians charged again that since the creation of Malaysia the British presence had increased instead of lessening. The new Federation was created by joining Malaya with the British possessions of Singapore, Sarawak and Sabah. Following the recent visit to this area of United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, the Indonesians agreed to halt raids into Sarawak and Sabah by guerrillas operating from the Indonesian part of Borneo. The present ministerial talks in Bangkok were also arranged, and Thailand was asked by the three nations to serve as the United Nations' representative in policing the cease‐fire. Another series of ministerial talks is expected to be held probably later this month, in the hope of agreeing on an agenda and a meeting place for Prince Abdul Rahman, Prime Minister of Malaysia, President Diosdado Macapagal of the Philippines, and President Sukarno of Indonesia. There was still disagreement over Indonesian based guerrillas who may still be on Malaysian territory. Malaysia and the Philippines are urging that they withdraw to Indonesia. The Indonesians have ordered them to remain in place with their weapons. The ministers have agreed that Thai observation teams acting as representatives of the United Nations will be sent to the area, and that these teams will be free to operate on either side of the border. A separate meeting was held this afternoon between Tun Abdul Razak, deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia who is acting as Foreign Minister, and Salvador P. Lopez, Foreign Minister of the Philippines. They discussed the Philippines' claim to special territorial rights in Sabah. This claim is the basis for the Philippines' refusal to recognize Malaysia, The two men agreed to continue their talks Monday in Pnompenh, where President Macapagal, who is on a state visit to Cambodia, will meet for two days with Prince Abdul Rahman.

1237-> HUNGARY ORDERS A BUILDING DRIVE; Attempts Made to Bolster Faltering Economy
VIENNA, Feb. 23 — Hungary's Communist leadership announced today an elaborate drive aimed at improving the efficency of the country's building industry and speeding the development of collectivized farms. The campaign is part of a many‐sided effort by the regime of Premier Janos Kadar to strengthen the flatering economy. In comparison with some other countries in the Soviet bloc, Hungary appears to be relatively prosperous. Her economic growth rate was given as 7 per cent last year and her standard of living is one of the highest in the bloc. Nevertheless, Hungarian officials are openly concerned about some unfavorable developments. Worker productivity has become stagnant at a comparatively low level and shows no sign of improvement. “Our workers are just not working,” one official commented. Productivity is especially bad in the building industry. The industry consistently lags behind plans and there is a critical housing shortage. Over‐all farm output increased by about 51 per cent last year, but serious weaknesses became obvious. Officials admit that nearly a quarter of the country's collective farms are so inefficient that they must be subsidized. Last year's grain crop was far short of requirements. The Government had to divert a considerable part of its hard currency from the purchase of machinery and consumer goods abroad to Western grain. Food increased from 19.7 per cent of total exports in 1962 to 23.1 per cent last year. The drive to improve agriculture and building was among decisions taken at a three‐day meeting of almost everyone of importance in the Hungarian Socialist Workers (Communist) party. A resolution covering the building industry demanded the modernization of techniques, better organization and improved pay for workers. It announced that the state would begin to give credit for private building. Party members were ordered to encourage farmers to cultivate as much land as possible. It also provided for the reorganization of the state machine tractor stations and the decentralization of some of their work.

1238-> PICTURES AND PEOPLE; Debuts for Warner LeRoy, ‘Atrox’—War in Norway—Local Producers
THAT sturdy aphorism, “like father, like son,” now may be applied to Warner LeRoy, who is preparing to follow in the footsteps of his dad, veteran producer‐director Mervyn LeRoy. Last week the younger LeRoy who is 28 and has been a theatrical producer here after having gained some experience as a film editor and assistant director, confirmed the news that he will make his movie directorial debut with an independent feature titled “Atrox.” He has joined forces with Paul Dopp, a movie tyro in his “early 30's” who is president of Butler Avia‐ tion Co., to produce the film. It will be made independently, starting this spring, in Paris, Le Roy said, “on a budget of about $1 million, and the financing, I'm happy to say, is already arranged.” LeRoy will direct from an original story and screenplay by Marc Behm (he wrote ths story of “Charade”) with, “in all likelihood, Vittorio Gassman playing one of the leading roles. “In all modesty,” LeRoy went on, “the story must be described as social comment done in farce style. 'Atrox' is derived the word atrocious, a nickname given to our leading character. He is a married man who devoutly believes in all the institutions ‐ the sanctity of marriage, the church, the government ‐ until he discovers his wife has six lovers, whom hedestroys, very neatly, with a saber, after which he turns into France's arch fiend. He goes about demolishing the police force, the army and most of the people around him, capping his reign of terror by trying to drop a hydrogen bomb.” The film, he elaborated, “will have almost no dialogue, since most of the story is done through action, much like technique of the silents. You don't need conversational dialogue to show 'Atrox' pushing people off the Eiffel Tower or kidnapping Miss Universe as she is being crowned. I think one extraordinary feature of the film is the fact that the villain does not pay for his crimes. I know it all sounds wild, but the basic idea ‐ to show the animal nature of man run Wild‐is sound, we're convinced.” DERRING‐DO: World War II may have been hell, as General Sherman once remarked about another conflict, but it also appears to an inexhaustible source of screen material. The latest moviemakers to tap this film font are Anthony Mann and S. Benjamin Fisz, who are‐about to tackle a little‐publicized aspect of the fighting in “The Unknown Battle,” which is slated to go before the cameras on March 15 in Norway. The Messrs. Mann and Fisz will make the drama under the banner of their company, Benton Film Productions, Ltd., and Allied Artists and Britain's J. Arthur Rank Productions will distribute the picture. Stephen Boyd and Elke Sommer will head the cast of the film, which will be based on “Skis Against the Atom,” a book by Capt. Knut Hankelid, and another book, “But for These Men,” by John D. Drummond. Mann, who will direct, is being given cooperation by the Norwegian Government in filming the action drama, which deals with a group of commandos who destroyed German heavy‐water installations, thus stopping the Nazis from producing an atom bomb. NEW ART: Our town's burgeoning list of independent moviemakers has just been increased by one with the formation of New Art Productions, an organization headed by Howard Gotbetter, a local lawyer involved in film business, and Jack Jason, who has been active in film and television production. Their avowed plan is to acquire, develop and produce “quality features with sensible budgets.” And, in implementation of this design, Mr. Gotbetter disclosed the other day that the company already had three properties in preparation. These are “Chuka,” a novel by Richard Jessup, from which the author has written a script and which is simply described as “an American 'Beau Geste',” and another screenplay by Mr. Jessup, titled “The Recreation Hall,” which he terms “an original love story based on a West Virginia mountain legend.” Also on the New Art roster is “The Delicate Dinosaur,” a comedy by William Altman. And, Gotbetter said, “we are bidding for Jessup's novel about poker players, 'The Cincinnati Kid.' ” BUSY: Embassy Pictures, which has as many productions in the hopper as any, has added another feature to its crowded schedule, and Shelley Winters, who is far from unemployed, is due to add this item to her commitments. The company plans to film “The Idol,” with Miss Winters as one of the leads, under the direction of Michael Anderson, in London perhaps this summer. “The Idol,” an original screen play by Ugo Liberatore, is described as a drama centered on a youth who is “violently disillusioned by an older man, whom he idolizes, when he discovers that his hero has been having an affair with his divorced mother.”

1240-> Figure in Nassau Vice Inquiry Found Dead in His Burning Car
JERICHO, L. I., Feb. 11 A motel operator described by the Nassau County District Attorney as a “very important figure” in his vice investigation was found dead today in a burning car. The man was Edmond M. Nugent, 49‐year‐old vice‐presudent of a corporation that owns and operates the Jericho Motel at Jericho Turnpike and Aberdeen Street. District Attorney William Cahn ruled out suicide as a cause of death. He said: “We do not know whether it was accidental or homicidal, but we do know that he was alive and breathing when the fire broke out.” An autopsy be conducted by the Medical Examiner. Because of the death of Mr. Nugent, Mr. Cahn said, “the investigation has been brought into a new light and has been expanded into a number of other jurisdictions.” Mr. Nugent, who lived at 27 Nixon Drive with his wife. Ellen, and four children. was once a bartender at the Copacabana in New York. He was found behind the wheel of his car at 6:20 A.M. by Frank Pulaski of 9 Harwick Road, Jericho, who was out walking his dog. Mr. Pulaski called the local fire department. At first the police listed the death as accidental. Chief of Detectives Edward Curran said later that the death was being investigated. At a press conference in his office in Mineola, Mr. Cahn said that Mr. Nugent was one of about 20 men who had been questioned in the investigation of a $200,000‐a‐year can‐girl operation. On Feb. 4, Mr. Cahn said, Mr. Nugent signed a two‐page statement admitting that “he had acted as a steerer” for one of 14 women taken into custody and subsequently released in bail as material witnesses. Pressed for details of Mr. Nugent's connection with the vice investigation, Mr. Cahn said: “He was definitely an integral part of the investigation — a very important figure. He supplied some of the names of 200 businessmen known to have been customers of the women who acted as call‐girls.” All the women taken into custody by Mr. Cahn are now married or have been. Five live at home with husbands and children; the others are separated or divorced. Husbands of three of the five women stayed home to baby‐sit while their wives worked as call girls, according to Mr. Cahn. He has indicated that he is considering charging the husbands with conspiracy for having permitted their wives to be prostitutes and for having lived off the proceeds of their income.

1241-> IDEA MAY CLARIFY IMMUNITY PUZZLE; Study Indicates Antibodies Are Formed in 2 Types
A new concept in explaining some actions of the body's natural internal defense system was suggested here at a scientific meeting last week. The concept involves the functions of antibodies. These are substances that the living body produces as its main line of defense against innfectious germs and other invaders. Antibodies are produced in response to almost any invasion —whether this be by germs or by foreign tissue. Once produced, the antibodies defend against the invasion by attacking the invader. The antibodies are produced by the body's immunological defense system. In some cases this defense system goes wrong and acts against its body's own tissues. result is called an autoimmune disorder: The antibodies involved are called auto‐antibodies. The new concept, based on animal experiments at New York University School of Medicine, is that some auto‐antibodies actually protect the tissues toward which they are directed. This runs counter to almost all previous views on the subject. One of the research workers involved said it suggests the hypothesis that the body may form two types of antibodies acting on the body's own tissues. One type is destructive, the other simply adheres to the tissues involved and thus prevents destructive antibodies or other agents from making harmful contact with those tissues. The hypothesis could explain a presently puzzling fact observed about people who seem to lack the normal human ability to form antibodies. Such people are known to be highly susceptible to infectious diseases. The explanation might be that they lack the kind of antibodies that would normally protect their tissues from attack from the body's other immunoligical weapons, he said. The report on protective autoantibodies was given by Dr. Philip Y. Paterson at an international conference on autoimmunity sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences. His co‐authors were Arlene M. Fox and Elaine M. Coia. More than 80 research reports were given at the three‐day conference, which was held at the Americana Hotel.

1242-> PHONE WORKER SAYS HE WAS ASKED TO LIE
A telephone company wireman asserted yesterday that his superiors at the New York Telephone Company had asked him to charge falsely that an attack on him had been made by teamster organizers. The assault took place New Year's Eve on an IND train pulling into the 74th Street Station in Jackson Heights, Queens, according to Charles T. Clayton, the wireman. Mr. Clayton made his charge against the telephone company at a news conference called by Henry Habel, who was president of Local 1101, which recently quit the Communications Workers of America to join the teamsters. Ballots in a representation election were mailed to eligible employes of the telephone company yesterday. Mr. Clayton, who is 31 years old and lives at 150‐126 150th Street, South Ozone Park, Queens, has been a telephone company employe for 14 years. At the time of the assault, he said, he was a loyal supporter of the C.W.A. and the attack took place during an argument with “two antiC.W.A. telephone workers.” He said that during an investigation by the company, his superiors had told him the Teamsters had been responsible for the assault. He said they had asked him to sign a statement accusing two telephone workers who are teamster organizers. He refused, he added, and agreed until Thursday “to keep quiet” about the matter.

1243-> FIELD OF TRAVEL; Skiing Season in the East Will Reach Its Peak Over Holiday Weekend
THE “No Vacancy” sign will be prominently displayed next weekend at hotels, ski lodges, inns and motels in all parts of the Eastern snow country. This is because Washington's Birthday traditionally marks the peak of the ski‐running season. And the fact that the holiday falls on a weekend this year should produce even bigger crowds. Recent snowfalls have blanketed the ski areas, with the result that skiers all seem to be of the same mind—to make the customary holiday fling a really big one this year. As far back as 10 days ago, innkeepers were busy digging up everything from cots to rollaway s in an effort to handle the invasion. In many quarters, requests for space were being turned down, and some skiers were reported settling for accommodations 30 and 40 miles away from the nearest ski center. Skiers were being advised to contact Chambers of Commerce or area housing sources in advance, rather than to assume that accommodations would be available upon their arrival. The United Nations buildings will be open evenings during the 1964 and 1965 World's Fair periods. Starting May 18 and continuing until Sept. 9, tours of U.N. headquarters in New York will be conducted from 9 A.M. to 10 P.M., Monday through Friday, and from 9 A.M to 6 P.M. on Saturdays and Sundays. The one‐hour tour costs $1 for adults and 50 cents for children and students. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has announced that fishing, hunting and use of the beaches will be allowed in the Merritt Island Launch Area in Florida. Fishing will be permitted from dawn to dusk, except in the construction area. Hunting is permitted in all sections designated by signs. Playlinda Beach, 16 miles east of Titusville, and the north end of the Launch Area will remain open to swimmers at least until September. Air fares between the United States and India will be lowered by Air‐India, effective April 1. The 28‐day round‐trip excursion fare between New York and Bombay or Delhi will be cut from $941.30 to $877.90. Economy‐class round‐trip fares on the route will be reduced from $1,191.30 to $1,127.90, while first‐class fares will drop from $1,989.50 to $1,856.30. Passengers also will have stopover privileges in London, Paris and other cities on the route to India. The TraveLodge Corporation, with more than 270 motels in the United States, Canada, France and Australia, is now offering accommodations in New York City. The motel here, called TraveLodge of New York City, was formerly known as Motel City. It is situated on West 42d Street, between 10th and 11th Avenues. Tours of 20 private homes on St. Croix, V. I., will be offered twice weekly until March 13. The annual event, which is sponsored by the St. Croix Landmarks Society, includes visits to three types of houses: historic “greathouses” of plantation days, homes built on sugar mill ruins and modern houses designed for island living. The tour price of $5 includes transportation. A five‐day rail tour from Chicago to Jackson, Natchez and Vicksburg, Miss., is scheduled for March 25 through 29 by the Illinois Central Railroad. The tour, which will stop at 15 antebellum houses in Natchez, the National Military Park at Vicksburg and an old country store, costs $130 a person. The fare includes transportation, meals en route, hotel accommodations, admission to various tourist attractions and dinner in Vicksburg.

ALBANY, N. Y., Jan. 18 —Governor Rockefeller has scheduled a meeting here at his office at 11 A. M. Monday with top representatives of the New York State Combined Council of Law Enforcement Officials. The principal purpose of the meeting is to discuss two bills designed to strengthen police powers. The first bill would permit the police to make raids without notice in instances where contraband might be destroyed or a safety factor was involved. Under present law, the police must knock on doors and present a search warrant, thus giving suspects time to destroy evidence. The second bill would give the police more freedom to halt and search suspicious persons in public place. During recent trials burglary suspects have been freed when it was proved that their handbags, found to contain stolen goods, had been opened without search warrents.

1248-> Gomer Jones Is Named to Succeed Wilkinson as Football Coach at Oklahoma; NO DECISION MADE ON ATHLETIC HEAD; Jones, an Aide for 17 Years, Gets Backing of College President and Ex‐Coach
NORMAN, Okla., Jan. 19 (AP)—Gomer Jones, 49‐yearold assistant coach, was named head football coach today at Oklahoma succeeding Bud Wilkinson. Wilkinson resigned as coach a week ago and as athletic director last Saturday. No decision was made at today's meeting concerning the athletic directorship, but it apparently will go to Jones, who was an aide under Wilkinson for 17 years. The regents ended a week of indecision and unanimously accepted the recommendation of the school's athletic council that Jones be hired. Wilkinson, who has said he is considering entering politics, strongly recommended Jones as his successor when he resigned as coach. The regents also interviewed three other assistant coaches before making their decision. They were Buck McPhail, backfield coach at Illinois; Sam Boghosian, line coach at the University of California at Los Angeles, and Mike Corgan, backfield coach at Nebraska. Jones, a former Ohio State star center, joined Oklahoma from Nebraska when Wilkinson was named to succeed the late Jim Tatum as head coach. Jones developed nine allAmerica linemen at Oklahoma. Jones has been a fixture at Norman since starting here in 1947. He had been offered several head coaching jobs, but always turned them down. Jones was supported by Wilkinson and Dr. George L. Cross, the president of the university. At a meeting with newsmen, Jones, speaking in a voice barely audible because of laryngitis, said he was happy that the regents had appointed him and thanked those who had supported him for the job. “I also appreciate more than I can say Bud Wilkinson's strong endorsement of me, also the support of President Cross, the athletic council and the faculty of the university. “The people of Oklahoma stood by me loyally, and I am very grateful for their support,” he said.

1250-> ‘CAMPEON’ HAILED BY PUERTO RICANS; Monserrat Leads City Drive for Equal Opportunity
In their widening drive for equal rights in a strange and often hostile city, New York's Puerto Ricans have come to rely more and more on a restless, bristly haired man named Joseph Monserrat. For years the mild‐mannered but hard‐driving Mr. Monserrat has served as a field general of the Puerto Rican community's fight to crack the barriers of discrimination and segregation. It was natural, then, that when Puerto Rican leaders began to map plans for a citywide civil rights organization to speed equal opportunities for their people, the course would be charted in Joe Monserrat's midtown office. It was also natural for these plans to be disclosed by Mr. Monserrat, as they were on Thursday. As national director of the migration division of the Puerto Rican Labor Department, he has the delicate responsibility of seeing to it that thousands of bewildered, often friendless migrants from the sunny Caribbean island of Puerto Rico find jobs, homes and hope in New York. “Our job is to help the migrant adjust to the community and to help the community adjust to the newcomer,” he says in his rapid‐fire delivery. His office, which covers six floors of an austere brick and graystone building at 322 West Forty‐fifth Street, is a modern version of the famous settlement houses that helped guide the European immigrants into the mainstream of city life. In it, Mr. Monserrat spent a day last week shaping plans for the new civil rights organization, preparing for a Puerto Rican youth conference, discussing the organization of a citywide Puerto Rican parents' group to tackle school problems, answering dozens of letters and taking phone calls at the rate of seven or eight every hour. “We spend much of our time here,” he said as he turned toward a visitor, “fighting myths about Puerto Ricans.” “There is the myth that the Puerto Rican comes to New York to get on relief, that he is dirty, lazy, prone to crime, that he is difficult to educate, that he is inferior.” “There is no Puerto Rican problem,” he continued, his brown eyes hardening behind horn‐rimmed glasses. “There are only Puerto Ricans with problems in a community with problems. We can't resolve the Puerto Rican's problems without resolving the community's problems.” “The housing problem, for example, was here before the Puerto Ricans came in large numbers and we can't solve the so‐called Puerto Rican housing problem without solving the city's over‐all housing problem.” Little mention is ever made of the contributions of Puerto Ricans to the city, he contended. “Puerto Ricans earn $525,000,000 a year in wages here and pay $90,000,000 in taxes,” he said. “Moreover, the island of Puerto Rico is the Port of New York's largest customer and pours huge sums into the city's coffers. “The Puerto Ricans have become so integral a part of the city's economy,” he asserted, “that if I could push a button to stop them from working, the whole city would come to a standstill.” Born in Puerto Rico 41 years ago and brought to New York when he was 3 years old, Mr. Monserrat knows what it is to be called and treated as “a spic.” Running his fingers through a thick head of black hair now flecked with gray, he recalled a day when a boy in his East Harlem block hurled this epithet at him. Then only 12, he bloodied the nose of his taunting adversary. Later, however, they became fast friends and he fixed this episode as one that led him to belive that patience and understanding could overcome hatred and violence. Joe Monserrat got his training for his present job in the Puerto Rican slum districts, as settlement house worker and first director of the Youth Board's project to curb delinquency by working with street gangs. He acknowledged, during the interview, that in some areas the “myths” about Puerto Ricans are fading but the basic problems of acceptance and adjustment for New York's 650,000 Puerto Ricans still remain — in housing, education aand jobs. In the slum‐studded Puerto Rican districts, Mr. Monserrat is known as “un campeon del hombre humilde” — a champion of the little man.

1254-> California Takes Over A Part of the Waldorf
FOR the next month, the Waldorf‐Astoria Hotel will be three hours behind time —Eastern standard time, that is. Last night, Gov. Edmund G. Brown of California set the lobby clock back to his state's time and officially opened a “California at Peacock Alley” festival, which will run until Feb. 10 Even though it may be snowing outside, it will be possible to sit in a citrus garden, surrounded by lemon blossoms and ripening oranges, and sip chilled California champagne or Margaritas (a tequila cocktail popular in California). To reach the garden that guards the entrance to Peacock Alley, it will be necessary to cross a “Golden Gate” bridge shaded by a 30foot redwood tree. The peacock emblem of the Alley has been covered, for the duration of festivities, by a picture of San Francisco's Market Street. This will act as a backdrop for the service of a variety of western‐flavored dishes and some 85 wines, representing 12 California vintners. For the price of a cocktail ($1.25) it will be possible to have a tasting of three different wines. The cost of a bottle will vary from about $3.25 to $3.75. In another part of the restaurant, a model wine cellar has been erected and antique winepressing equipment, a corkscrew collection and an exhibition of 400 years of wine glasses will be on display. The idea for the California display was born when Fred Matt, food and beverage manager of the Waldorf, passed through California on his way to Japan. It was his first sight of the state, and he was impressed. “I began to wonder how many millions of Americans travel to Europe every year without ever seeing their own California,” he commented before the festival opening, during a lull between receiving a consignment of flowers (birds of paradise) and tasting a veal‐and‐avocado dish created by Eugene Scanlan, the hotel's executive chef. “Somehow the idea stuck,” Mr. Matt said. “We decided to have a wine tasting. Then we decided to have food to go with it. Then, in the chef's dining room, we cooked up the idea of adding all of California.” Mr. Scanlan has caught much of Mr. Matt's enthusiasm. The chef has cooked up a staggering number of dishes for the festival —some from West Coast chefs, some from California cookbooks, and some he has “dreamed up.” “It isn't hard to dream up new dishes when you have so many foods to work with,” he said. “Of course, I knew how many foods came from California, but I didn't know how big a the state produces —almost 100 per cent of products like avocados, artichokes, dates, figs, brussels sprouts and garlic.” Fresh food, notably fish from the San Francisco Bay area, is being flown in daily throughout the festival. This includes cracked crab, rex sole and tiny bay shrimp, which will be featured in many dishes. Some sour dough bread will be flown in, and more will be baked here. The first asparagus of the season is expected shortly, and fresh dates will also be brought in. One of the chef's creations is a fresh date fluff, made by smashing the dates in a mortar and whipping them with freshly made vanilla ice cream into a foam — the whole thing flavored with a little California brandy. It is called Mojave Desert Foam.

1255-> CANADA AND SOVIET SIGN ATOM ACCORD
OTTAWA, Jan. 24 (UPI)—Canada and the Soviet Union signed today a five‐year agreement to cooperate in the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The agreement, between Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd., and the Soviet State Committee for the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, was reached after a delegation of five Soviet officials had spent 10 days visiting atomic energy centers in Canada. Last July three Canadians were conducted on a similar tour in the Soviet Union. Dr. I. D. Morozov, first deputy chairman of the Soviet committee, and J. L. Gray, president of the Canadian organization, signed the agreement, which permits the two countries to organize visits by small groups of specialists who will exchange unclassified scientific information and possibly instruments and equipment.

1259-> GOLDWATER SAYS DISSENT IS STIFLED; Rights Bill Goes Too Far, He Insists in New Hampshire
MANCHESTER, N. H., Jan. 21 — Senator Barry Goldwater said today that attempts to stifle conservative dissent had led to “fascism of the left.” Mr. Goldwater also became involved in an exchange over civil rights with a 19‐year‐old Negro co‐ed from New York. He defended his record on tolerance, but said the civil rights bill pending in Congress went too far. The Arizona Republican encountered winds and showers as he flew into New Hampshire to resume his campaign in the state's Presidential primary election, scheduled for March 10. He took up his running fight with his chief opponent, Governor Rockefeller of New York, over what constituted orthodoxy and heresy in the Republican party. He said he did not want “to have anything to do” with the 1960 Republican platform, which he called a losing document. That platform was regarded as “liberal.” It indirectly criticized the Eisenhower Administration's policy in several fields, including defense and welfare. The Senator landed at Manchester, then drove through nearby towns before returning here for a speech at the Junior Chamber of Commerce. In a jammed, noisy meeting with several hundred students at the New England College in Henniker, Joan Carrington of 952 St. Nicholas Avenue, New York, a petite sophomore, asked Mr. Goldwater to state his view on civil rights. “I dont think we can go as far as this present civil rights bill tries to go, and say you have to like me and I have to like you,” he replied. He said the “right of free assembly” or choice of associates was one that “we must not destroy ” Civil rights problems will be solved “if we live as we are supposed to live,” he went on, but the problems of discrimination “will never be solved in your lifetime or mine.” The Senator emphasized, “I don't like discrimination and segregation.” All his life, he said, he has “done something” about the problem. As chief of staff of the Arizona National Guard, he recalled, he desegregated th unit, and as a Phoenix city councilman he worked to deseg regate a restaurant on public property. He has contributed money to civil rights causes, he added. Miss Carrington said later his replies had not “completely” satisfied her. Asked if she would vote for him if she were able, she said “no.” At a “public coffee” in St. Andrew's parish house in Hopkinton, Mr. Goldwater told a small audience that “disagreement and dissent are being discouraged in this country.” He said elements of the press and Government wanted to “downgrade a man because he wants to dissent.” “What we have actually today is fascism on the left, if you want to classify it properly,” he said. “Under fascism you are not allowed to say anything, and under Communism, too.” Mr. Goldwater exercised his role as a conservative dissenter as he covered the snowy country side. He spoke to town‐meeting audiences, argued with a few Democrats, shhowed annoyance at some Harvard law students who dogged his steps, pinched a baby's cheek and bought his first pair of galoshes. After a brief talk in the Bedford Town Hall, Mr. Goldwater stood at the door like a country parson, talking and shaking hands with the emerging crowd of about 150. Mr. Goldwater scoffed at Governor Rockefeller's assertions that the Senator was not a good Republican because he had not supported the 1960 Republican platform. He told a meeting at the Goffstown Masonic Hall that the party had lost on that platform. It was written in a “smoky room four years ago,” he said, and it “didn't do us any good.” Governor Rockefeller had a heavy influence in drafting the 1960 platform. In a nonpolitical speech to the Junior Chamber here Mr. Goldwater said “I don't buy” criticism portraying Congress as not passing enough legislation. He said that “quality, not quantity” should be the yardstick for measuring Congress. “It isn't what we do, but what we don't do” that is most important, he added.

1260-> CALF THYMUS GLAND IS GIVEN TO WOMAN
TULSA, Okla., Jan 20 (AP) —A thymus gland from an unborn calf has been transplanted into a 44‐year‐old Tulsa woman as an experimental treatment for advanced cancer. The woman was reported doing as well as could be expected today, but her physicians said it was too early to give an opinion on the success of the operation as a possible cancer treatment. The woman, a mother of seven children, was not identified. She received the 6‐inch long 4½‐ounce gland in a two‐hour operation on Wednesday. Other treatments for her cancer of the liver had been unsuccessful. The thymus gland plays a major role in formation of antibodies that fight infection. By the transplants the doctors hope to stimulate in the woman an output of antibodies that might attack and destroy her cancer cells. The woman's thymus gland was not removed. The gland of the calf, taken from the mother by Caesarean section, was inserted as a supplement.

1262-> Music in Running Lines; SELECTED POEMS OF OCTAVIO PAZ A bilingual edition with trans­lations by Muriel Rukeyser. 171 pp. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. $5.75.
A LEADING member of the middle generation of poets writing in Spanish today, Octavio Paz was born (1914) in Mexico City, and has pursued the double career, more common in Latin America than in our country, of literature and diplomacy. Like his compatriots, Alfonso Reyes and Jaime Torres Bodet, he is the ideal combination of writer and man of affairs. Like them, he has been influential in the founding of literary reviews that have significantly altered the direction of poetry and criticism; he differs from them chiefly in that he has devoted far more than they of his remarkable gifts to the composition of poetry. And it is important poetry, im passioned, wide‐ranging, most handsomely and attentively constructed. Miss Rukeyser's bilingual edition is in most respects a model of what good translation should be; but even if it were less good, we should still be indebted to her for the first generous representation in English of a poet who means much in the world today. The fact that Señor Paz has had to wait 20 years for this first adequate act of introduction to us may have its bearing on our fumbling management of the Alliance for Progress — one would like to hear his own thoughts on that subject—but we can at least hope that his translator will follow up the breakthrough that she has effected. The poetry is American, Latin, Indian. Expectably, the early work shows the influence of the preoccupations and literary fashions of the thirties: the delayed assimilation of Imagism, the hokku fad, the arietta snippets of Juan Ramon Jiménez informed by the stronger impetus of Garcia Lorca and Rafael Alberti; but Octavio Paz was already demonstrating, even in these derivative books, the lyric hard quality that was to transcend all customary modes. A tenderness and a fierceness completely controlled; a mimetic flexibility of diction and intonation that is admirable in its rightness; a spiritual élan that is unembarrassed by elevation and indifferent to humiliation; and music, always the music of the running line—these are his idiosyncratic qualities, and obviously they are a translator's despair. It would be too much to expect Miss Rukeyser, or anyone else that I can think of, to give us in translation the full force of Octavio Paz. Her engagingly modest prefatory remarks prove that she knows this, and the compensatory method that she has chosen is the only intelligent and sensible one: a line‐by‐line paraphrase (practically metaphrase, in Dryden's sense of the word) of the Spanish text, which is printed on the opposite page. One cannot insist too much upon the necessity of this bilingual presentation, when a familiar modern language is involved: translation without the original text is irresponsible, and printers' charges for foreign composition must simply be passed on to the consumer. IN the present instance this matter is taken care of. We can therefore applaud the translator's many triumphs and commiserate with her over the exasperating howlers—for example: “your men” instead of “your shoulders” in “Seeds for a Psalm”—that bedevil every one of us in this game. Because Miss Rukeyser is herself a poet, her versions have the ring of poetry in English, but never exhibitionistically, and rarely at the expense of the Spanish. She has elected to suggest the rhythms of the original, even to the extent of rendering hendecasyllabic lines — in “Virgin,” for instance, one of the finest poems—in 11‐syllable English; and although there is a certain amount of dilution and verbal expansion, the trick works, and works well. So does the book as a whole, to be brief about it; Señor Paz is as happy in his translator as we are grateful to her for her labors.

1263-> NEW‐SCHOOL PLAN DECRIED AS AIDING RACE IMBALANCE; Study by City Rights Panel Says 28 Projects Will Be 90% Negro‐Puerto Rican; SITE POLICY IS ASSAILED; Board Has Failed in Effort to Select ‘Fringe’ Areas, Consultant Declares
The Board of Education's building program is creating segregated schools faster than the board can end racial imbalance under its integration plans, a study by the City Commission on Human Rights charges. The millions of dollars being spent on the new buildings represents an “additional investment in segregation that will make the problem even more difficult to solve in the future,” the report declared. The study was made by Dr. Max Wolff, a consultant to the commission, who is director of research for the Migration Division of Puerto Rico. Dr. Wolff's study, which has not been publicly announced, charges that 28 of the 98 elementary and junior high schools in the 1965–66 building program will have enrollments in which Negroes and Puerto Ricans will constitute at least 90per cent of the student body. Twelve other schools, the study declares, will have Negro and Puerto Rican enrollments of 70 to 89 per cent. The study also said that 24 schools under construction now would be at least 90 per cent Negro and Puerto Rican. The projected ethnic composition is based on the assumption that existing zoning practices will continue. A number of civil rights organizations have asked the Board of Education to halt construction until the new schools can be fitted into an integration program. Among the organizations that have made such a demand are the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Congress of Racial Equality, the New York Urban League and the Citywide Committee for Integrated Schools. However, Dr. Calvin E. Gross, the Superintendent of Schools, and James B. Donovan, the president of the board, said last week that the new buildings were needed and that a halt in construction would not be in the best interests of the system. Dr. Wolff, in his report, suggested that the funds being used to build schools in Negro and Puerto Rican areas could be used instead for schools to the same areas and still be racially balanced. Dr. Wolff said “the policy of the Board of Education, embodied in many resolutions, has been to seek ‘fringe sites' for new construction.” “This policy,” he asserted, “has failed in practice, and the current budget proposals indicate that no successful effort has been made to solve the problem posed by this failure.” In 1954, when the board expressed a commitment to integration, the system had 52 schools in which at least 90 per cent of the pupils were Negroes and Puerto Picans. By last fall, Dr. Wolff declared, the number had risen to 165. “Clearly, a new solution must be sought to prevent such massive investment in further segregation of schools,” Dr. Wolff said. He suggested that one approach might be to establish educational centers or parks. These centers would consist of a number of schools—elementary, junior and high—in a campus setting and would draw pupils from a wide area. City school officials have had this concept under study for about a year. One member of the board, Joseph G. Barkan. has suggested the possibility of; an educational park at Flushing Meadow after the World's Fair closes in 1965. School officials also have said that although the number of predominantly Negro and Puerto Rican schools had increased, the number of schools in which Negroes and Puerto Ricans were a small minority had dropped‐from 342 to 225 in the last seven years. This, they say, represents improved integration. On Jan. 29, as part of its integration plan, the board tentatively proposed that 20 Negro and Puerto Rican elementary schools be paired with 20 white or integrated schools. It also proposed changes in the zones of 10 jumior high schools. Since then, however, school officials have had second thoughts about the desirability or the soundness of many of the specific changes and have held the plans in abeyance. Members of the school board and Dr. Gross will receive today from a special state advisory committee a report that could determine the course of school integration here. The committee was asked to look into the city problem by Dr. James E. Allen Jr.,the State Education Commissioner.

1265-> MUSICAL AT FAIR HITS UNION SNAG; Equity, Variety Artists and Musicians Involved
Union problems have jeopardized plans for a musical extravaganza at the Texas Pavilion in the New York World's Fair 1964‐65. The production, called “To Broadway With Love,” would employ several hundred persons. The troubles are twofold. One involves a jurisdictional dispute between Actors Equity Association and the American Guild of Variety Artists over who should represent the actors, singers and dancers. The second problem has arisen because Angus Wynn, the producer of the show, is on the “unfair list” of the American Federation of Musicians for employing nonunion musicians on his “Six Flags Over Texas” entertainment area in Houston. Although the Texas Pavilion producer is willing to use union musicians for his World's Fair show, Local 802 of the Associated Musicians of Greater New York has refused to supply the men without authorization from the parent union. The impasse has resulted in conferences between the unions and the producers with Edward C. Maguire, labor relations counsel to the fair. Also playing a prominent part in the negotiations has been the entertainment union council of the fair, which includes the artists, stagehands, electricians and other crafts. John Coleman Jr., business manager of Local 4 of the Theatrical Stage Employes, who is chairman of the entertainment union council, said yesterday he though that the difficulties would be resolved. He added, however, that failure to arrive at agreement could result in cancellation of plans for “To Broadway With Love.” The projected production consists of scenes and songs from outstanding Broadway musicals of the past. An arbitration proceeding between Equity and A.G.V.A. resulted in a decision favoring Equity. Conrad Nagel, president of the Associated Actors and Artists of America, parent organization of the actor's groups, ruled that “To Broadway With Love” had a story line and belonged to Equity jurisdiction. Although this decision was construed by Equity as binding on A.G.V.A., the variety artists’ group retaliated by canceling an agreement it had with Equity covering industrial shows in general. Many actors, dancers and singers are members of both Equity and A.G.V.A. Should the fair production be canceled, it would mean a loss of work for about 100 entertainers who belong to one or both unions.

1267-> Short Cab Protest Likely Today As City Plans Action on Rates
Representatives of 5,000 taxi owner‐drivers agreed yesterday to try to reduce considerably the length of a work stoppage that had been planned to last six hours today. The said they would hold a meeting of the taxi men as planned at 10 A.M. today in the Sunnyside Garden Arena, Queens Boulveard and 45th St. Long Island City, but would urge the men to return to work immediately afterward instead of staying out until 4 P.M. The taxi men's leaders agreed to do that after they had received assurance that the' City Council's Finance Committee would hold a public hearing on a bill to increase fares by 10 cents. Alfred J. Marks, a vice president of the Independent Taxi Owners Council, said he was confident the drivers would accept the advice he and other spokesmen would give them to adjourn their meeting for two weeks and go back to work immediately. The Council Committee is expected to announce a date for the public hearing before the two weeks are over. The taxi men have been demanding the hearing as a means of informing the public of their problems. The assurance that it would be held was given by Council President Paul R. Screvane. It was relayed to the taximen by Henry L. Lambert, president of the New York Board of Trade, at a meeting at Longchamps Restaurant, 253 Broadway, opposite City Hall. Mr. Lambert had called the meeting because many concerns feared their business would be adversely affected if about 40 per cent of the city's taxicabs remained off the streets for six hours . He said he would attend the meeting . this morning and join the appeal for an immediate return to work. At yesterday's conference, he was supported by Councilmen Paul O'Dwyer, Democrat of Manhattan, and Theodore R. Kupfreman, Republican of Manhattan, in arguing against the work stop page. The Councilmen said they would consult their colleagues on setting a date for a public hearing. Benjamin Botwinick, chairman of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, Inc., which represents the fleet owners, told the conferees that the fleet owners would distribute all of the 10‐cent increase, if it was granted, to their drivers in commission and fringe benefits. Some councilmen are understood to be insisting that the full 10 cents be distributed among the drivers employed by the fleets. They object to a proposal submitted to them by the fleet operators that includes the use of some of the increased funds for pay increases and other benefits for inside help. The bill before the council would increase the starting rate from the present 25 cents to 35 cents. The charge of 5 cents a fifth of a mile thereafter would be retained.

1268-> Musial Wins Slocum Award for Long and Meritorious Service to Baseball; WRITERS SELECT RETIRED SLUGGER; Cardinals' New Executive to Be Honored at Dinner in New York on Feb. 2
Stan Musial who, since retiring as an active player at the close of the 1963 baseball season, has been picking up awards with almost as much ease and celerity as Sandy Koufax, has just won another notable prize. Stan the Man, who set countless records with his bat during his 22 seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals, was named the winner of the William J. Slocum memorial award for “long and meritorious services to baseball” by the New York Chapter of the Baseball Writers Association yesterday. He will receive the award at the writers' 41st annual dinner on Feb. 2 in the Americana Hotel. Musial thus becomes the only player to date to have won. both of the New York writers two major awards. The Sid Mercer memorial award as player‐of‐the year went to Stan in. 1947. As previously announced, the Mercer award this year will go to Koufax, the Dodgers' ace southpaw and World Series hero. He Filled Record Books Baseball's record books are studded with the feats of the 43‐year‐old Musial's, who became baseball's hardest slugging grandfather last summer. During his 22 years, all with the Cardinals, the Man from Donora, Pa., won the National League batting title seven times and appeared in a record number of 20 All Star games. Excelling both as first baseman and outfielder, Musial won the National League's most valuable player award three times. What makes the Musial saga all the more incredible is the fact that back in 1940 Stan believed his career as a ball player had opened and closed all in the one season. That year the 19‐year‐old Stan was a Class D pitcher at Daytona Beach and he suffered a shoulder injury that ended his pitching hopes. However, he already had revealed himself a robust hitter and he was induced to try his hand at outfielding. Late in the 1941 season he was called up from the minors by the Cardinals. “All I hope,” confided Stan to a friend “is that they'll let me stay up here for a year or two.” He remained long enough to become one of baseball's five $100,000‐a‐year players. The others in this group are Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle. A wealthy man today, with interests in various St. Louis enterprises that include a bank and a restaurant, Musial still remains connected with the Cardinals as an executive. In winning the New York writers' meritorious plaque, oldest of all baseball dinner awards, Musial, like Koufax with the Mercer prize, joins an impressive list of diamond notables. The first recipient was the late Miller Huggins, who piloted the Yanks to their first pennants in the Twenties. That was in 1929. The following year the writers chose to honor one of their own, the late Bill Hanna of the Herald Tribune. Then came such celebrities as Babe Ruth, Wilbert Robinson, John J.

1270-> News Analysis; Armies Without Friends; Apathy of Public in Germany and Japan Viewed as Handicap to Military Forces
German and Japanese armed forces are handicapped by psychological isolation from their nations and the lack of symbolic and social incentives. These handicaps, in the opinion of experts, apply particularly to the armies of both countries. The navies and air forces are believed to have somewhat better morale, though they in no way compare with their pre‐war counterparts. Troubles in the West German Army were publicized recently when the Defense Minister, Kai‐Uwe von Hassel, announced that 30,000 fewer men than had been planned would be added to the armed forces this year because of a serious shortage of noncommissioned officers. The announcement followed a series of trials of noncommissioned officers for maltreatment of troops. Mr. von Hassel said that German noncoms were depressed by their lack of acceptance by the public and their inferior “social prestige.” Observers believe that public apathy, suspicion and outright antagonism toward the armed forces in Germany have adversely affected the entire rank structure from private to general. The German Army has excellent equipment. It is probably as well equipped as any army in the world, man for man, and is better equipped than any other ground force in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization except that of the United States. It has some fine younger officers. Yet the guidelines that established the new West German Army and that have controlled its development have hurt discipline, morale and smartness. The German nation, in revulsion against the excesses of the Hitler period and a lost war, tried to “democratize” and “civilianize” their new armed forces. The procedures and methods have gone so far that, in the opinion of some experienced observers, the West German Army today is inferior in such intangibles as discipline, the authority of officers and dedication to prior German armies and to most of the armies of other major powers today. The reform of the army, now being started by Mr. von Hassel, contemplates essentially the restoration of pride and public acceptance to the German soldier. The restoration of regimental colors and other traditional military symbols and perhaps in time the establishment of mil itary courts‐martial to replace the present system of trial in civil courts are among the measures contemplated. Such measures cannot come too soon, in the opinion of many observers, for there is no better way to create a “state within a state” than to maintain armed forces that feel themselves inferior outcasts. The same basic problem confronts the Japanese Self‐Defense Force. Yoshitaka Horie, a Japanese military critic and lecturer, said in an interview published in Tokyo last summer that the Japanese uniformed forces were preoccupied with economics —“retirement allowances, pensionc or civilian jobs.” “Not even lip service is accorded the notion that duty consists of defending the motherland,” he said. In the interview, published in the English‐language Orient West magazine, Mr. Horie said: “All over Japan you find people asking, ‘Why do we have wasteful organizations?’ Two examples of so‐called ‘wasteful organizations’ come up in the same breath — the Imperial Household Agency and the Defense Agency.” “Most of the people view the Japanese Self Defense Force as Japan's ‘diplomatic obligation’ to the United States — the latter's ‘puppet troops,’ in fact,” he said. “To be frank, I believe that the people of Japan would cooperate with the free world only to the extent of the power of America's military might,” he added. “It might be next to impossible to expect from the Japanese people any strong bonds for defending their own country.”

1271-> Murrow Quits Post; Rowan Is Successor
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 —President Johnson announced today that Edward R. Murrow had resigned as director of the United States Information Agency. Mr. Johnson said he would name Carl T. Rowan, a blunt and controversial former newspaperman, to succeed Mr. Murrow, who has been in ill health. Mr. Rowan, now the United States Ambassador to Finland and once an Assistant Secretary of State, will hold one of the highest Government offices ever occupied by a Negro. Another Negro, Robert C. Weaver, is administrator of the Housing and Home Finance Agency. Neither man has Cabinet rank, but the White House press secretary, Pierre Salinger, said TODAY THAT MR. ROWAN WOULD BE THE FIRST NEGRO TO SIT IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. THE DIRECTOR OF THE INFORMA‐TION AGENCY HAS BEEN DESIGNATED FOR A COUNCIL SEAT SINCE EARLY IN THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION. MR. MURROW, THE FORMER NEWS AND TELEVISION PERSONALITY, TOLD MR. JOHNSON IN A LETTER DATED JAN. 19: “AS YOU KNOW, I WAS SEPARATED FROM A CANCEROUS LUNG IN EARLY OCTOBER.” HIS RECOVERY WAS NORMAL, HE SAID, BUT IT WOULD BE MONTHS BEFORE HE COULD RESUME FULL‐TIME DUTY” OR DIRECT THE INFOR‐MATION AGENCY “AS YOU ARE EN‐TITLED TO EXPECT IT TO BE DI‐RECTED.” MR. JOHNSON, ACCEPTING THE RESIGNATION WITH “THE GREATEST RELUCTANCE,” SAID HE RECOGNIZED THAT “THE SAME HIGH SENSE OF DUTY” THAT HAD BROUGHT MR. MURROW TO WASHINGTON “NOW OBLIGES YOU TO DEPART.” THE PRESIDENT'S LETTER ENDED WITH THIS SENTENCE: “I CLOSE, ED, WITH A PARA‐PHRASE OF THE WORDS YOU MADE FOREVER FAMOUS ON RADIO AND TELEVISION: GOOD‐BY AND GOOD LUCK!' ” HAILS ROWAN'S QUALIFICATIONS THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED MR. ROWAN, WHO IS 38 YEARS OLD, AS “THE MAN MOST EMINENTLY QUALI‐FIED TO SUPERVISE THIS VITAL PRO‐GRAM OF TELLING AMERICA'S STORY ABROAD.” MR. ROWAN, HE SAID, IS “YOUNG AND DYNAMIC AND HE HAS HAD A BREADTH OF PRIVATE AND GOVERN‐MENTAL EXPERIENCES THAT ARE ES‐PECIALLY VALUABLE QUALIFICATIONS FOR THIS JOB.” “AS A PERCEPTIVE OBSERVER OF WORLD AFFAIRS, AS AN EFFECTIVE DIPLOMAT AND PUBLIC SERVANT, AS A TIRELESS WORKER FOR THE IM‐PROVEMENT OF AMERICA'S POSI‐TION IN THE EYES OF ALL THE WORLD, HE IS SUPERBLY QUALIFIED BY TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE TO CARRY ON THE WORK OF ED MURROW,” THE PRESIDENT WROTE. MR. JOHNSON AND MR. ROWAN FIRST BECAME CLOSELY ACQUAMMTED IN 1961, WHEN MR. JOHNSON, THEN THE VICE PRESIDENT, TRAV‐ELED AROUND THE WORLD AS A SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY. MR. ROWAN, THEN THE DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS, ACCOMPANIED THE VICE PRESIDENT AS HIS PRESS SPOKESMAN. BOTH MEN ARE OUT‐SPOKEN AND STRONG‐WILLED, AND they clashed frequently during the trip. By the time it was over, however, Mr. Johnson had developed a high opinion of Mr. Rowan's ability as well as his willingness to stand up to his superiors and back up his positions. The two men worked closely together again last year when Vice President Johnson toured the Scandinavian countries. Mr.

1276-> U. S. Treasury Decision; LUXEMBOURG WINS DUMPING DECISION
WASHINGTON, March 2 (AP)—The Treasury ruIed today that welded standard steel pipe from Luxembourg was not being sold in the United States at less than fair value. Under the Antidumping Act, the United States may levy a special tariff against imports that are being sold at less than fair value and which injure United States industry. About $4 million of welded standard steel pipe from Luxembourg was sold in this coun‐try in 1962. The case is one of a series involving welded standard steel pipe, used extensively for plumbing. Protests had been made by United States companies on steel pipe imports from several European countries and Japan. The value of these imports runs to the tens of millions of dollars. The Treasury recently ruled that no steel pipe from West Germany was being sold in this country at less than fair value. The pending cases involve imports from Britain, France, Belgium and Japan.

1278-> APATHY IS PUZZLE IN QUEEN SKILLING; Behavioral Specialists Hard Put to Explain Witnesses’ Failure to Call Police; INTERPRETATIONS VARY; Some Say Tendency Not to Get Involved Is Typical —Others Call lt Uncommon
Expressions of shock and perplexity followed the disclosure yesterday that 37 witnesses to a murder in Queens had failed to report the crime to the police. Experts in human behavior, such as psychiatrists and sociologists, seemed as hard put as anyone else to explain the inaction of the witnesses. One sociologist called it “nonrational behavior.” The murder took place two weeks ago in the Austin Street area. of Kew Gardens. Miss Catherine Genovese, 28 years old, was attacked three separate times, within a span of 35 minutes. by a man with a knife. Miss Genovese's cries aroused a total of 38 of her neighbors, some of whom witnessed the stabbing from their apartment windows. One of them, after hesitation, did call the police, but by then she was dead. Suspect Was Arrested The police have since arrested a 29‐year‐old business machine operator, Winston Moseley, and charged him with the murder. Most: of the witnesses, in attempting to explain, their, inaction, said they “did not want to get involved.” Walter Arm, Deputy Police Commissioner for Community Relations, said the case was “dramatic and shocking,” but added that “this tendency to shy away from reporting crimes is a common one.” Mr. Arm announced that the police department would soon redistribute a leaflet called “Law and Order is a Two‐Way Street,” which exhorts citizens to “report all crime immediately” and to “report to the police all suspicions of criminal activity.” He said several hundred thousand copies of the leaflet had been distributed in the past be cause the department had 1ong been concerned with the prob lem of public apathy in reporting crimes. Bar Official Indignant Leo J. Zimmerman, vice president of the Queens Bar Association, called the incident “outrageous” and said he was “profoundly shocked.” He said he was not speaking on behalf of the bar association. Mr. Zimmerman, is organizing a “Law Day U. S:” program to be held May 1 at the World's Fair Pavilion in response to a proclamation by President Johnson requesting that such ceremonies be held throughout the nation. Mr. Zimmerman said the .Kew Gardens case showed the need for such programs to “indoctrinate the: public with their responsi bility” and to "fight this tend ency to look the other. way .” Psychiatrists, psychologists and sociologists assigned vary ing explanations and signifi cance to the event. Dr. Iago Galdston, a psychi atrist, said, “I Would assign this to the effect, of the megalopolis in which we live which makes closeness very difficult and. leads to the alienation of the individual to the group.” He said.: he was “quite sure this never could have happened in a small community—the response would, have been immediate and very human.” Leo Srole, a sociologist who is a professor at the Downstate Medical Center of New York State University, said the incident “goes to the heart of whether this is a community or a jungle.” He suggested that when members of a society fail to defend each other they can come close to being “partners in crime.” But he added that he felt the Incident was atypical and that it would be wrong to condemn New York as a community. A. psychiatrist, Dr. George Serban, who is on the staff of the New York Mental Health Clinic, said the behavior of the witnesses was “typical” of middle‐class groups in a city like New York. “They have a nice life and what happens in the street, the life of the city iiself, is a differ ent matter,” he said. Fear Society Is Unjust But he also said that such behavior reflected a “constant” feeling that “society is unjust to them.” “It's the air of all New York, the air of injustice,” he said, “the feeling that you might get hurt if you act and that, whatever you do, you will be the one to suffer.” In a sermon last night, the Rev. Joseph C. Holbrook Jr., of the Grace Reformed Church of Flatbush at Bedford Avenue and Lincoln Road, Brooklyn, said of the apathy toward the slaying that “our society is as sick as the one that crucified Jesus.” Dr. Renee Claire Fox, an associate professor of sociology at Barnard College, said, on the other hand, that the witnesses had shown what she called a “disaster . syndrome” something like that seen in victims of sudden disasters such as tornadoes. She said that witnessing a prolonged murder under their own windows had destroyed their feeling that the world was a “rational, orderly place” and as a result it “deeply shook their sense of safety and sureness.” The result, she ventured, was an “affect denial” that caused them to withdraw psychologically from the event by ianoring it. The Rev. Lawrence Durgin of Broadway Congregational Church pondered the incident and said he was reminded that in the parable of. the Good Samaritan that “it was supposedly good people who passed by on the other side.” He said shock grew out of the fact that we are “reluctant; perhaps, to admit that we haven’t made much progress since then.” A theologian said; “I can’t understand it. Maybe the depersonalizing here has gone farther than I had thought.” But then he added “Don’t quote me.”

1283-> Kennedy Recalled
Edward P. Morgan's new television program, “A.B.C. News Reports,” was off to a winning start last night in its relaxed and incisive appraisal of the wit, vitality, courage and love of family of President Kennedy. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., historian and aide to Mr. Kennedy, and Benjamin C. Bradlee, chief of the Washington Bureau of Newsweek and one of the President's closest journalist friends, talked unhurriedly of the personal qualities of Mr. Kennedy. After so many televised recollections of the President by his friends it might seem that the theme would invite repetition. But in their manner of phrasing, point of view and knowledge of specific details the two guests fashioned their own cameo portrait and it consistently held attention. Mr. Morgan's wise decision not to try to cover too much ground at one time contributed importantly to the rewards of the 30 minutes. “A.B.C. News Reports” promises to be a civilized addition to TV public affairs attractions, particularly since it is booked for evening time on a weekday.

Nineteen per cent of the town's 4,543 elementary school children are Negroes.

1287-> An Unacceptable Substitute
The ethics bill introduced into the State Senate on behalf of Majority Leader Walter J. Mahoney is not an acceptable substitute for the recommendations of the Special Committee on Ethics headed by Cloyd Laporte. Senator Mahoney turned violently on the committee when it made public its proposals for broadening and strengthening the existing code of ethics for members and employes of the Legislature. The major deficiencies of the Mahoney bill are: (1) its refusal to forbid legislators who are lawyers from appearing for compensation before the State Court of Claims; and (2) its dilution of the limitations on their appearance before state regulatory agencies, as urged by the Special Committee. These go to the very heart of the reforms recommended by Mr. Laporte and his colleagues after a diligent study of the shortcomings of the existing code. Members of the Legislature are public officers of the State of New York. For them to appear, for fees, before the Court of Claims in behalf of clients who are suing the state is an obvious and glaring conflict of interest. No man can serve two masters, nor should he attempt to do so. Furthermore, judges of the court are appointed by the Governor with the consent of the Senate. The impropriety of a Senator who has voted to confirm a judge subsequently appearing before him is equally apparent. The Mahoney bill would also permit lawyerlegislators to continue to appear for compensation before state regulatory agencies whenever “there is no reasonable possibility that the action of the agency will be unduly influenced.” Thisrestriction is worthless. What agency would ever admit that it was unduly influenced by the appearance of a legislator before it, even though its personnel were well aware that the legislator might have a great deal to say about its appropriations for the following year? We urge the Legislature to adopt the Special Committee's well‐conceived program, not this watered‐down substitute. And we urge Governor Rockefeller to speak up, while this vital matter is in the balance, with something better than generalities about the need for effective action. Those who believe in effective action should support the committee's recommendations.

1288-> NIZER CONSIDERING RUNNING FOR SENATE
Louis Nizer, the lawyer, has made a conditional decision to seek the Democratic nomination for United States Senate from New York. Mr. Nizer, it was learned last night, would carry through his attempt only if Adlai Stevenson, the United States representative at the United Nations, and Mayor Wagner decided not to make the race. Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Wagner have been prominently mentioned as possible candidates against Republican Senator Kenneth B. Keating next November. Mr. Nizer, who is 62 years old, has never run for public office. He is the author of “My Life in Court” and other books. Recently, Mr. Nizer conferred with the Mayor, who reportedly encouraged him. A group of unidentified business and political leaders, both here and in Washington, has formed a committee in support of Mr. Nizer.

1290-> Why Row? College Captains Provide Answers
He has sacrificed many of the renowned pleasures of college days. In the spring at least, his social life is nonexistent. No one on the campus knows physical toil as he and his teammates do. Often his object is to drive himself beyond the known limits of his endurance. He receives few tangible rewards, but finds others. He accepts and enjoys the anonymity inherent in his way of life. He claims moments of pleasure beyond those attainable in other sports and he believes what he is doing is essentially better than what others do. He likes belonging to an interdependent group. In fact he is clannish, saying only those of his kind can know the reason why—why crew? He is an oarsman, any one of several hundred rowing on college crews this spring in pursuit of an activity that defies academic cynicism. The convertible, with the top down, is the springtime symbol of American youth, not the oar. Yet rowing is in ascendency, found in more schools and colleges now than ever before. “You must almost be crazy to row,“ says John Weisser, captain of the Marietta College crew. “People find it hard to believe that oarsmen train so hard, so many months in advance, to row well for a six‐minute race. Many races are backed by three to four hundred hours of practice, but the reward of victory is worth it.” Weisser was one of a group of college crew captains who recently answered, with considerable assent, a series of “Why crew” questions. Sacrifice, they all wrote, is the name of the game. “The whole year is a series of sacrifices of individual desire to the physical well being and the morale of the crew,” said Findley Meislahn of Princeton. “It's hard when spring vacation nears and your friends are going to Florida or Aspen,” wrote John McLaughlin of Dartmouth. “You are going to Kent, Conn., to do absolutely nothing but row for two weeks.” At Dartmouth sacrifice is more than symbolic. Oarsmen, must pay around $100 a season to enjoy a sport that lacks full college support. This is true of crew at many colleges. Physical sacrifice is easily found. “At the Eastern sprints in 1962,” recalled McLaughlin, “I saw many men pass out. To pull so hard you pass out is one of the goals I hold for myself. It is a bit on the masochistic, side, but I would like to push myself all out to try to that close race.” But there is no excuse for passing out during a race, according to Harry Pollock of Harvard. He wrote, “You must finish, which may mean rowing in oblivion.” Crew is not for the indolent but “for the man willing to work,” says Princeton's Meislahn. To Don Light of Cornell, “Crew is a thinking man's sport. To be good, one must think about what he is doing every single stroke. “One must use all his muscles: legs, back and arms. Each must be coordinated perfectly. This coordination and thinking must, in turn, be coincided perfectly. with seven other men in the same boat. That's why it's such a challenge to practice.” Perfection is beyond the oarsman. Harvey Love, the late Harvard coach, once told Pollock that there is no such thing as a perfect oarsman. Cornell's Light thinks that if he ever could become perfect, he would quit out of boredom. At the same time, Meislahn suggests, “An oarsman must have a burning desire to excel, the ability to push oneself to the limits of human endurance and still maintain poise and concentration.” But where are the rewards? Meislahn knows. “I have never achieved a greater thrill or sense of satisfaction than the feeling of a boat swinging together and moving away from the others in a race. It combines the pleasure of conditioned physical exertion with a sensation halfway between floating and flying.” Pollock of Harvard agrees. “When a boat is really moving, the rowing is not so effortful. The speed of the boat is selfsustaining. You feel like you can beat the wind.” Crew is strong on values. “It's a discipline, a way of life,” wrote John Robohm of Brown. “One's whole attitude changes under the value of crew. A coach once told his squad, ‘Carry crew up from the river to school. Don't leave behind what you learn.’ ” Ray Josefson of Columbia believes that crew teaches the achievement of single‐minded purpose with the object, “to win.” He added, “Once the action is taken, it should be pursued utterly.” Many of the captains agree with the contention of Jim Norvell of Navy that crew builds self‐confidence … “self‐confidence that you’ve got guts. There's value in knowing you can pull that last half‐mile in the varsity boat when others could not.” Pollock, who wrote 1,500 beautifully ‐ chosen words for this inquiry, stressed the unity of an eight‐oared crew. “It requires the most corporative :effort. The spectator does not realize the precision; that eight oars are gripping and releasing the water, all at the exact same moment, and all in the correct manner. There is one way to ‘catch,’ but hundreds of ways not to. “On account of the great effort of each individual oarsman to produce a corporative result, meaning the fastest boat, it is not surprising that the unity within the squad is very deep. There is a unique feeling of comradery among crewmen, not only within a particular squad but within the entire rowing world.” Crew does have its distasteful moments. “When the junior varsity passes you in practice,” cited Pollock. Rowing on a cold windy day, when ice forms on the oars, gives McLaughlin of Dartmouth no pleasure. John O’Brien of St. John's has often climbed into an icy sweat suit at 6 A.M. and wondered about his sanity. “But it paid of,” he said. “We have a winning crew.” Crew has few trumpets and perhaps needs no more. “It isn't that no one cares to shout the praises of crew,” said McLaughlin. “It is that anyone who really knows crew does not need to shout. about it. “It is not a spectator sport. There are moments of beauty but the uneducated do not appreciate them. I would like to see more attention paid to crew, only that others could have the opportunity to enjoy what I have enjoyed.” “The public,” said Meislahn, “is preoccupied in idolizing individuals, therefore there is little interest in nameless oarsmen.” Then why does the gospel spread? Novell of Navy explains, “There is interest in a sport that is interesting. This is pure sport. There's no money. No good deals. No glory. The unity of the boat, the fanaticism and religious ardor of oarsmen all attribute to crew's growth.” O’Brien of St. John's said simply, “Crew teaches you to do a thing for the love of doing it rather than wondering how you can get a buck out of it. This seems to be a little lacking in incoming freshmen. You can almost feel the need of this sport in the United States.”

1293-> A.&P. WINS DELAY IN SUIT WITH FAIR; Court Reserves Decision on Dispute Over Neon Sign
The A. & P. won a tactical court victory yesterday in the fight to keep its Jane Parker sign as part of the World's Fair's unofficial skyline. The State Supreme Court reserved decision on three motions after a hearing in which the disputants submitted several pounds of legal documents, photographs and maps, attacked each other's motives and cited the “plight” of “millions”of persons. The A. & P. had asked the court to grant an injunction preventing the World's Fair Corporation from blocking out its sign. Lawyers for the fair had urged that the request for the injunction be dismissed and that a final determination be rendered on the basis of the legal papers submitted to the court. Need for Trial Seen Justice Louis A. Capozzoli said, after consulting a colored map of the fair, that it was his belief that the dispute would have to go to trial. In the meantime, he said, the fair would be restrained from its announced plan of blocking the sign. In disputes of this nature the court's position is usually to maintain the status quo until a final court decision is reached. A trial might last for weekslong past the April 22 opening date of the fair, it was said. Robert Moses, president of the fair, said in an affidavit that he was attempting to prevent fairgoers from being a “captive audience sentenced to watch its [A. & P.'s] tawdry message.” “We ask,” he continued, “that we be allowed to take measures on our land to keep the A. & P.'s notions of taste from overflowing its boundary line and contaminating the World's Fair.” Howard W. Gilb, president of A. & P.'s national bakery division, whose trademark is Sane Parker, characterized Mr. Moses's statements as “reckless, false and malicious.” The food‐store chain contends that Mr. Moses is trying to block Its sign as a “spiteful” measure because it refused an invitation to participate in the exposition. The fair wants to put up an artificial foliage fence 450 feet long and 80 feet high at a cost of “at least $75,000.” It would stand well within the fair grounds, 750 feet from the red neon Jane Parker sign atop an A. & P. bakery. Plans for the fence were adopted after engineers at the fair abandoned earlier sugges tions that called for a barrage of giant balloons or pennants. Mr. Moses, through his law yers, expressed concern that if the bakery sign cannot be partially blocked to viewers within the fairgrounds, “the secondmost important site” at the fair will become an eyesore. The sign says in 10‐fooi‐high letters “Jane Parker A. & P. Baked Foods,” and stands in a direct line with the Fountain of the Planets, the $2.5 million center of the fair's industrial section. Every night at 9 during the 1964‐65 exposition, there will be a “stupendous” water display at the fountain, according to fair officials.

1294-> ROBERT KENNEDY FAVORED IN POLLS; Is Vice Presidential Choice of Party“s Rank and File
Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy is currently the favorite of Democratic voters for the Vice‐Presidential nomination, according to numerous confidential political polls taken during the last five weeks in more than a dozen states across the country. In the polls, conducted privately in behalf of candidates for various offices in their respective states, Mr. Kennedy“s first‐place ratings ranged from 54 per cent in Massachusetts, his home base, to 17 per cent in Texas, the home of President Johnson. A recent professionally conducted poll in Massachusetts found 61 per cent would like a member of the late President Kennedy's family as runningmate for President Johnson. That was deduced from replies to a question in which a cross‐sectional sampling of the Bay State's Democrats was given an opportunity to volunteer a favorite. The question: “Whom would you like to see as Democratic candidate for Vice President?” Fifty‐four per cent quickly named Attorney General Kennedy, some referring to him as “Bobby” or “the older one”; more than 1 per cent picked Senator Edward M. Kennedy, some referring to him as “Teddy or “the younger one”; and 3 per cent said “either Kennedy”. In addition, 3 per cent named Sargent Shriver, director of the Peace Corps and brother‐in‐law of the Kennedy brothers. Those choosing Senator Kennedy either did not know or care that he is ineligible for the nomination because of his age. The minimum constitutional age for a Vice President is 35; the Senator observed his 32d birthday in February. A paradox was turned up by polls in three Southern states. Attorney General Kennedy led as choice for Vice President, and at the same time he was the only potential nominee who might cost President Johnson votes. The sampling in Texas was typical. It indicated that a Johnson‐Kennedy ticket would run 3 per cent lower at this time than a ticket of Mr. Johnson and other well‐known prospects, such as. Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota. Though leading, Mr. Kennedy's first‐place percentage was not high in Southern states. The poll in Texas, for instance, reported that over 60 per cent of the voters proposed a variety of names, including Gov. George C. Wallace, of Alabama, who is conducting a segregationist, anti - Johnson drive in the North and South. The confidential political polls, generally, show only Senator Humphrey and Ambassador Adlai E. Stevenson to be vying seriously with Mr. Kennedy, at present, in the thoughts of rankand‐file Democrats. In a few places one or the other is rated slightly ahead of the Attorney General. Two polls, conducted independently of each other, rate Mr. Stevenson a point or two ahead in the New York suburbs. In New York City, Mr. Kennedy outpolls Mr. Stevenson by a slight margin, and Senator Humphrey is shown a close third. Samplings in upstate. New York found Mr. Kennedy to be the first choice of approximately 40 per cent of the voters. Mr. Stevenson and Senator Humphrey were in a near‐tie for second place, with about 20 per cent each. President Johnson reportedly has access to many of the con fidential polls, including those privately ordered and conducted in behalf of candidates for governor and senator in several states. Whether the poll showings affect the President's selection of his running mate is considered by observers to be problematical at this time. One top‐echelon Democratic party leader noted yesterday: “It would depend on how well the President, himself, is doing in the polls in August.” The Democratic National Convention will open Aug. 24.

1296-> APPALACHIA IS PRIME TARGET OF WAR ON POVERTY; Region Is the Nation's Largest Economic and Slum Problem; Johnson Has Asked Congress for Special Program for Area
WASHINGTON, May 2 — In much of America, there are pocketsof poverty in the midst of plenty. But in Appalachia, there are merely pockets of plenty in the midst of poverty. Appalachia is a ruggedly beautiful region embracing 10 states, sweeping southward from Pittsburgh to Birmingham. Despite the wealth of some of its cities, Appalachia has become the nation's biggest economic problem, its largest and most stubborn rural slum. With this in mind, President Johnson asked Congress last Tuesday to single out Appalachia for a $228 million economic pump‐priming during the fiscal year starting in July. More, perhaps up to $4 billion, would be earmarked for the region in years to come. Appalachia, course,    billion‐dollar package sent to Congress two months ago by the President. But that program, a countrywide one, would be geared to human needs. It would set up a job corps whereyouths would receive remedial education and job training, provide them with parttime work while in high school or college, help finance local projectsto wipe out poverty, establish a domestic Peace Corps and provide new funds for small businesses and farmers. The Appalachia program, strictly regional one, would deal largely with long‐range economic development, including highways and dams. The region has rich, largely untapped resources. Great stands of timber cannot be reached by road now. Water is plentiful, but largely unharnessed. The mountains provide some of the most beautiful scenery in Eastern America, but the access roads are poor and there are few recreational facilities to lure tourists. Because Appalachia is poor, many of its people are poor.And because many of itspeople are poor, the region in turn is poor. Thus, the Administration's billion‐dollar poverty program alone would do little to solve Appalachia's problem. Youths could come down from the hollows and enroll in the job corps to receive jobtraining. But unless Appalachia develops economically, there will be no jobs for them to fill. Aid could be given in settirg upsmall businesses, but only if those businesses had hope of finding customers with money. New industiies could be persuaded to settle in Appalachia, but only if they were assured of adequate roads and water systems. The two programs together, the President has said, are essential if Appalachia is to escape from its bonds of poverty. The region embraces all of West Virginia and part of nine other states, Pennsylvania, Ohio Kentucky, Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia. It covers 165,000 square miles, an area 10 times the size of Switzer land, and includes 340 counties with a population of 15,300,000. Using any yardstick, Appalachia lags behind the nation as a whole, such as: One in three families lives on less than $3,000 a year. In the nation, the figure is one in five. Of all houses, 26.6. per cent need major repairs. In the nation, the figure is 18.1 per cent. The unemployment rate in Appalachia was 7.9 per cent in 1963, while the national rate was 5.7 per cent. However,Federal officials esttmate there are enough hidden unemployed (those who have ceased trying to find work) to boost the actual male unemployment in Appalachia to 15 per cent and female unemployment to 21:4 per cent. The per capita expenditure for education is $53.80 a year. In the nation, it is $69.68. The people of Appalachia drop out of school more frequently, buy less goods and save less money than those in the nation as a whole. To open up theregion to more tourists, more timbering and more industry,alargepart of the ecoromic development money would go intohelping the statesbuild highways. Other millions would go into flood control, water impoundments for industry and recreation, sewage treatment plants, improvement of timber production and marketing, conversion of marginal farmlands into pastures for livestockproduction and programs to promote new uses of coal and to restore land scarred by mining. President Johnson is virtually certain toget a poverty program through Congress this year, despite Republican efforts to scuttle much of his bill and to substitute their own ideas on how best to fight poverty. But how much of the billiondollarprogram will be kept intact is uncertain. The Appalachia program, because it is regional, could run head‐on into trouble, too, unless the President exerts pressure. Despite conflicting claims that the Johnson proposals for dealing with poverty are too little, too late and too much, too soon, the programs. could go far in wiping out some of America's poverty, if only by arousing the American people to do something about the problem. Realists concede that it will take many years, and many billions of dollars, to make a real dent. Even then, there is little that caa be done formost of the adults. But many of the yauths, born into poverty, could be rescued through education and job training.

1297-> ANDREAS HERMES, OF ANTI‐NAZI PLOT; Member of 1944 Effort to Kill Hitler Dies at 85
BAD GODESBERG, Germany, Jan. 4 (AP) — Dr. Andreas Hermes, a Cabinet officer in Germany's Weimar Republic after World War I, died today at the age of 85. Dr. Hermes was condemned to death for taking part in the 1944 conspiracy against Adolf Hitler, but the sentence was never carried out. After the war he was Deputy Mayor ef Berlin and served as head of farmers' organizations. Between 1920 and 1923. Dr. Hermes was Food Minister, Agriculture Minister and Finance Minister at various times According to Dr. Hermes, he was the last surviving leader of the plot to kill Hitler. The plot's ultimate objective was the overthrow of the Nazi regime with the arrest of all major leaders and the establishment of a new government that would sue for immediate peace. The conspiracy, which began early in 1943, was bungled from the start. The plot leaders failed to win Allied support for their plan. Twice during 1943 efforts were made to kill Hitler by time bombs in briefcases. The first time the bomb failed to detonate in Hitler's plane at his Eastern Front headquarters. In the second attempt Hitler failed to appear in a hotel room where the bomb was planted. In July, 1944, three more attempts were made. Col. Count Klaus von Stauffenberg, a staff officer, carried an explosive in a briefcase to a conference with the Fuhrer on July 6, 12 and 16. Each time he postponed the detonation because of the absence of other top Nazi leaders from the gatherings. It was believed that in each of the five attempts the bombs were removed undetected, although there was also a suspicion that Heinrich Himmler, the Gestapo chief, had information about the plot. It was felt that he was biding his time. The date set tor tne next attempt was July 20, 1944. Again, the plans went awry when the site of a conference was switched from a bunker to a wooden hut. Again, Count von Stauffenberg carried the briefcase, this time to place it under Hitler's table and stroll outdoors. He was to fly to Berlin immediately after the explosion to rally military commanders there under the new regime. The explosion took place, but much of the blast was absorbed when the tin roof of the hut was blown off. Hitler had left his chair to examine a map just before the blast and, although four of the assembled group in the hut were killed, he escaped with lacerations of the left arm and leg that were to leave him paralyzed and partly deaf. Because a plan to destroy communications had not been carried out, Hitler's staff was able to command aIl German Army leaders to remain loyal to the Nazi leadership. Hitler's voice was used to persuade doubtful commanders. The plot had failed. It was estimated that at least 5,000 persons were executed for alleged participation. Dr. Hermes, brought into the plot in February, 1943, was scheduled to hold the post of Agriculture Minister in the new government. Until the bomb exploded, he was in frequent communication with the other civilian and military leaders of the plot. “We solemnly decided we would accept any terms offered us by the Allies,” Dr. Hermes declared after the war. “We realized this would mean unconditional surrender but were convinced the war was lost and that we must save as many flives as possible and prevent the physical destruction of German towns and cities.” He said that the organization behind the plot had been small but strong and that its members had great confidence that they would succeed. He said he felt that only unforeseen circumstances made it fail. Dr. Hermes did not learn of the explosion until he heard a radio broadcast by Goebbels. Two days later he was arrested. He was found guilty of high treason on Jan. 11, 1945, and sentenced to death. Through appeals, he managed to postpone execution until April, when the Soviet Army was marching on Berlir On April 25 Soviet troops broke open the doors of his prison and set him free.

1301-> GRIFFITH CHARGES REFEREE HIT HIM
The welterweight champion, Emile Griffith, returned to New York by plane yesterday with his purse and a headache after Wednesday night's riotous “nocontest” fight in Rome with Juan Carlos Duran of Argentina. “My forehead still smarts from being slapped repeatedly by the referee [Fernando Pica], who couldn't talk English,” explained the still angry Emile. “And that referee nearly got me and Duran and others killed when the fans started throwing bottles and everything else they could pick up.” Their scheduled 10‐round bout at the Palace of Sport was stopped at 2:47 of the seventh round. It was ruled “no contest” by the Italian Boxing Federation. However there was no investigation and the purses were not held up. “I'll never fight again in Italy,” said Griffith, “unless I get a terrific purse there and unless they have neutral officials.” The champion's co‐manager. Gil Clancy, said: “We've just been through one of the most amazing experiences in the annals of sport. I never saw anything like it. It's almost a miracle that we and a lot of other people weren't killed there.” Clancy said Duran was almost afraid to fight because of stories published in the Rome papers about how Griffith knocked out the late Benny (Kid) Paret, who. died of ring injuries.

1303-> Eagles Obtain Ringo and Gros for Caffey in Packer Trade; GREEN BAY GETS DRAFT PICK, TOO; Ringo, a Center, and Gros, Fullback, Are Exchanged for Young Linebacker
GREEN BAY, Wis., May 5 (AP)—The Green Bay Packers traded a center, Jim Ringo, and a reserve fullback, Earl Gros, to the Philadelphia Eagles today. They received a linebacker, Leroy Caffey, and the Eagles' No. 1 choice in the National Football League draft next December. Ringo, 32 years old, a seventh‐round draft choice in 1953 after he had starred at Syracuse, has been an all‐N.F.L. selection as a blocking center for seven years. He has not missed a game with Green Bay in 10 years. Gros, 24, was Green Bay's No. 1 draft choice three years ago. A former Louisiana State star, he has served as an understudy to Jim Taylor for two seasons, carrying 77 times for 367 yards and four touchdowns. Caffey, 23, became a starter as a left linebacker in his rookie season with the Eagles last year. A seventh‐round draft pick, the 6‐foot‐3‐inch 240pounder played fullback and linebacker at Texas A. and M. He is reported to be able to run 100 yards in 10.1 seconds and last year returned an intercepted pass 74 yards against the New York Giants. Ringo, 230 pounds and 6‐2, has been the Packers' offensive captain. Gros, who is fast and big, 6‐3 and 230 pounds, didn't get much chance to play because of the durability of Taylor, runner‐up to Jimmy Brown of Cleveland in rushing last season. The Eagles' new head coach, Joe Kuharich, was elated with the trade, the fourth the Eagles have made in two months. These were the other deals: ¶Tommy McDonald, a pass catcher, was sent to the Dallas Cowboys for two linemen, Lynn Hoyem and John Meyers, and a kicking specialist, Sam Baker. ¶Sonny Jurgensen, a quarterback and a defensive back, Jim Carr, were sent to the Washington Redskins for a quarterback, Norm Snead, and a defensive back, Claude Crabbe. ¶A tackle, J.

The Packers apparently desired .Caffey to strengthen their linebacking corps in the event Bill Forester carries out a plan to retire after 11 years in the N. F. L. The trade of Ringo left the Packers without an experienced center, although an offensive tackle, Bob Skoronski, could fill in at the position.

1308-> APATHY SLOWING NEGRO VOTE DRIVE; Uprooting of Families Also Cited in Northern Cities
Apathy and a constant up‐rooting of Negro families were described yesterday as the major problem encountered in a drive to increase the number of Negro voters in 34 Northern states. The campaign, which involves communities from Maine to Hawaii, is being conducted by 300 local branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Its goal is to add one million Northern Negroes to the nation's voting rolls this year. Calvin D. Banks, N.A.A.C.P. coordinator of the campaign, described it yesterday as “a coldly calculated move to strengthen the poiitical voice of the Negro in the North.” “Our branches,” he explained, “are approaching this challenge with great seriousness. They realize this is the key way of ??nonstrating real muscle in the civil rights struggle.” The execution of the campaign, Mr. Banks said, is being left to the local branches. Early reports, he indicated, are showing progress and pinpointing common problems. “There is a tremendous mobility among the Northern Negro,” Mr. Banks said. “A search for economic stability may take the Negro family from one community to another. This makes it difficult for them to meet the residence requirements in many communities.” Apathy Called Obstacle Apathy among many Negroes, particularly those who have mi‐grated from the South, was also cited as an obstacle in many Northern communities. Many of these Negroes, Mr. Banks said, come from Southern areas where they were threatened with violence and economic destruction if “they even thought about registering to vote." In the North, Mr. Banks continued, “registration is sometimes the last thing they think about.” “Some become indifferent when they see no improvement in their economic status and take the attitude that their vote won't help things,” he said. “It's these people we want to get.” Mr. Banks said that 800 Negroes had been registered in Compton, Cal., as the result of a recent weekend door‐to‐door canvass by the local branch there and by 125 students from the University of California. The N.A.A.C.P. official said the Northern drive was part of a nationwide voter registration campaign, Its efforts are being matched in an expanded registration drive in Southern communities, he said. The nationwide effort is also being coupled with the N.A.A.C.P.' s voter education program, which, according to Roy Wilkins, executive director, is laying the groundwork “for what we may have to do after the votes for and against the civil rights bill are recorded.”

1309-> HOFFA AGAIN LOSES A MISTRIAL MOTION
CHICAGO, May 4 (UPI) —Federal Judge Richard B. Austin rejected today for the third time attempts to have a mistrial declared in the $20 million fraud trial of James R. Hoffa. A defense attorney, Maurice J. Walsh, demanded the mistrial because of remarks made by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to a group of students of the University of Chicago Law School last weekend. The judge overruled motions for a mistrial or a continuance, as he also did last Wednesday and Friday. The Attorney General was quoted in local newspapers as telling the students that he became familiar with corruption in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters when he was attorney for the Senate Rackets Committee. Hoffa heads the union. “The remarks were made by a Government official who came to this territory to make his prejudicial remarks,” Mr. Walsh said. He asked that if a mistrial were not granted, Judge Austin should call a continuance “until such time as the prejudice is dissipated.” Only four jurors were seated last week, the first week of the rial of Hoffa and seven co‐defendants. By noon today Judge Austin had all but exhausted the original 300 prospective jurors summoned. An additional 100, called Friday, were standing by. Hoffa and the others are charged with conspiring to fraudulently obtain $20 million in loans for the teamsters pension fund and with diverting $1 million for their own use.

UNITED NATIONS, N.

Archbishop Makarios and his Greek Cypriote supporters have been demanding changes in the Constitution, changes that the Turkish comnunity fears. In demanding the end of the treaty, Greece and Cyprus will run into powerful opposition from Britain and Turkey. The treaty was one of the conditions of independence because it established the rights of the minority. It also guaranteed that Cyprus, lying just off Turkey's coast, would not fall under the control of any other power and become a threat to. Turkish security.

1319-> DWORMAN WIDENS PROJECTS ON COAST; Office‐Apartment Building Planned in Los Angeles
Dworman Associates has announced plans for a combined office and apartment building in Los Angeles. The $12 million project, first of its kind in Southern California, will be on a 115,000square‐foot plot on the south side of Sunset Boulevard, between Las Palmas and Cherokee Avenues. Alvin Dworman, partner in the building concern, said the development would include two apartment towers. One will be 24 stories high and will contain 192 apartments, and the other will be 20 stories high and will have 249 units. The apartment rents will be scaled for uppermiddle ‐ income families. Each apartment will have a private balcony. The three‐story base of the structure will have two floors of office space and cultural facilities—shops, studios, galleries and the like. An arcade will run through that part of the building, covered with a skylight. There will be interior courts and gardens off the stores and offices. The third floor will consist of a park‐like sun deck and will contain recreational facilities for tenants, including a swimming pool, tennis courts and a health club. Beneath the commercial area there will be a two‐level underground garage with space for 716 cars. According to Mr. Dworman, the design is planned so that there will be no conflict between the commercial and residential sections. The office and store areas will be completely selfcontained. Construction is scheduled to begin in the summer, with completion planned for 1965. Dworman Associates recently completed the Churchill, a $4 million apartment building on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. The concern is starting work on six apartment structures in the Western Addition development in San Francisco. In all, Dworman will start work on nearly $40 million in projects on the West Coast this year.

The Quebec Transport Department said today the icebreakers had started nudging their way toward Montreal, and that the Helga Dan was following them. Officials were unable to say immediately how many miles closer to their destination the vessels had advanced. The record for the first arrival in a new year is March 12, made by the Helga Dan in 1962 and equalled by her sister ship, the Thora Dan, last year.

1324-> PRESIDENT URGES A $1 BILLION DRIVE AGAINST POVERTY; STRESS ON YOUTH; Message to Congress Asks a Job Training Corps and U.S. Aid
WASHINGTON, March 16—President Johnson placed his controversial billion‐dollar war on poverty on the Congressional firing line today and declared, “Our objective: total victory.” His long ‐ delayed program embracing both new proposals and some similar to ones pending in Congress, would focus primarily on two areas: ¶Helping 380,000 underprivileged young people—in the first year alone—to break the cycle of poverty through job training and education in camps, centers, communities and campuses. This would cost $412.5 million. ¶Stimulating local communities throughout the nation into waging antipoverty wars of their own with Federal assistance. This would cost $315 million. One startling new proposal would authorize Federal loans to nonprofit corporations to acquire rural land and develop it into family‐size farms for sale to low‐income families. Other Programs Sought There are other proposals to create new jobs for the unemployed, to reduce welfare rolls by providing job training for breadwinners and to create a sort of domestic peace corps. “The war on poverty,” Mr. Johnson said in his special message on poverty to Congress, “is not a struggle simply to support people, to make them dependent on the generosity of others. It is a struggle to give people a chance.” Already under attack in some quarters as an election‐year bid for votes, the President's program faces an uncertain fate in Congress. Its success could rest, largely on the President himself and on the persuasiveness of the man he has named as his “personal chief of staff” for the war against poverty: Sargent Shriver, director of the Peace Corps. To Testify Before Panel Mr. Shriver would probably resign from the Peace Corps to become head of the antipoverty program at a salary of $22,500 a year, if the program is approved by Congress. The Peace Corps post carries a salary of $20,000, but Mr. Shriver serves without pay. He will be the lead‐off witness when the House Education and Labor Committee, headed by Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Democrat of Manhattan, opens hearings on the Administration's bill . The program, bogged down in controversy from the begin‐ ning, was hammered out in the last six weeks by a task force headed by Mr. Shriver. He and his aides consulted nearly 150 business, labor and agriculture leaders, educators, authors and Government officials. Many parts of the President's program echo proposals made by President Kennedy and already before Congress: a domestic peace corps, work‐study for college students, worktraining for young people, work‐relief for parents of children on welfare rolls and civilian work‐training camps for youths. But Mr. Johnson proposed new programs, too, principally ones to induce community action and to assist rural families. By wrapping all these programs — new and old — into one package, the President hopes to convince Congress that a concerted drive could go far in wiping out poverty in America. Mr. Johnson declared that his plan “charts a new course.” He said it “strikes at the causes, not just the consequences, of poverty.” The program would cost $962.5 million the first yearabout 1 per cent of the national budget. The cost in subsequent years has not been determined. The President said that the program would not throw his $97.6 billion “economy budget” out of line because “every dollar I am requesting for this program is already included in the budget sent to Congress in January.” Early reaction to the President's program ranged from quick endorsement by some Democratic Congressional leaders to disappointment by the Americans for Democratic Action. “The A.D.A. welcomes this long‐awaited first salvo in the war agagainst poverty,” John Roche, national chairman, said.“However, we regret that this first battle is not to be fought in greater strength.” The program was hailed as a forward step by George Meany, president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. However, he urged that other legislation — including medical care for the aged, housing programs and extension of the wage‐hour law—not be forgotten in the war against poverty. To coordinate the antipoverty drive, the President asked for creation of an Office of Economic Opportunity, to be headed by Mr. Shriver. The office, employing 200 to 400 persons and directly under the President, would direct some phases of the program; other phases would be administered by various Government departments. The most costly single proposal—$315 million for stimulating community action programs—would be directed by the Office of Economic Opportunity. Under this plan, the Federal Government would finance up to 90 per cent of the costs of such community programs in the first two years and 75 per cent thereafter. Communities would have to submit plans, showing that they proposed to mobilize their educational,health and social welfare resources to combat poverty. The second most costly part of the program would be the job corps, designed to provide young males aged 16 through 21 with job training and education in about 100 civilian camps and training centers. This plan, costing $190 million and administered by Mr. Shriver's office, would seek to enroll 40,000 youths the first year and eventually up to 100,000. Enlistments would befor up to two years. Half of the youths would be enrolled in camps—unused military facilities or old Civilian Conservation Corps camps now belonging to the Agriculture or Interior Departments. There, they would work on conservation projects, but the emphasis would be on basic education. The other youths would be assigned to residential training centers providing basic education and job training. The job corps would be directed by a “distinguished educator,” Government sources disclosed. There is speculation that this position would go to Dr. Harold Taylor, former president of Sarah Lawrence College, who is now special consultant to Adlai E. Stevenson, chairman of the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial Foundation; or to Arthur S. Flemming, president of the University of Oregon, who was Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the Eisenhower Administration. Another project focused on youth would provide work and training in home communities for up to 200,000 boys and girls, aged 16 through 21. This could cost $150 million. These projects would be developed by state and local governments and nonprofit agencies and would be administered by the Department of Labor. Young persons would be put to work in hospitals, libraries, playgrounds and other nonprofit facilities. The Federal Government would pay up to 30 per cent of the cost for the first two years and 75 per cent thereafter. A third plan for youths would be a work‐study one under which 140,000 young men and women from low‐income families would help pay their college expenses through parttime jobs on campus or in public or nonprofit agencies or organizations off campus. They would be limited to 15 hours of work a week. The Federal share of this program would be up to 90 per cent the first two years and 75 per cent thereafter. It would be administered by the Department of Health, Education andWelfare and would cost $72.5 million. One project would focus on rural needs. It, too, would be designed to help halt the exodus of the unskilled from farm to city. Although costing a relatively modest $50 million, the rural project, under the Department of Agriculture, could prove to be the most controversial part of the President's war on poverty. The proposal calls for loans to nonprofit corporations to acquire rural land for development into family‐size farms for sale to low‐income families at an appraised value for agriculture purposes. The Federal Government would also underwrite any losses between the cost of land acquisition and the appraised value. The proposal would also authorize grants of up to $1,500 and loans up to $2,500 to lowincome families to acquire, improve or operate family‐size farms or supplement income, and provide loans to cooperatives providing services, not otherwise met, to low‐income families. To expand existing programs to create new jobs for the hardcore unemployed, loans amounting to up to $10,000 for each new job created for the hardcore unemployed would be made to new industries settling in areas with community action plans. This would cost $25 million. The present Area Redevelopment Administration program is currently limited to loans to industries locating in surplus labor areas. Another feature of this proposal would authorize loans of up to $1,500 to small businesses on more liberal terms than the regular loan provisions of the Small Business Administration. This would not require additional funds because there is existing funding authority. Another proposal, costing $150 million, would seek to stimulate states into providing work training and basic education for parents of children receiving welfare payments under the aid‐to‐dependent‐children program. “The antipoverty program would also authorize the creation of a domestic peace corps to be known as Volunteers for America and numbering anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000. It would cost $10 million. The volunteers would be assigned to migrant labor camps, Indian reservations, federally assisted mental hospitals and the new lob corps. They would also be available for community action programs, if requested.

Dr. Frank L. Cohen of 965 Minisink Way, Westfield, N.J., a vice president of Merck &Co., Inc., died yesterday at the Neurological Institute of tlie Columbia‐Presbyterian Medical Center. His age was 59. Dr. Cohen, who joined the pharmaceutical and chemical concern as a research chemist in 1931, had been vice president for operations of the Merck Chemical division since 1959. He was responsible during his career for the establishment of the company's large‐scale production of steroid hormones, vitamins, antibiotics and, more recently, diuretics and antihypertensives, as well as products for animal health and nutrition. Mr. Cohen was a native of Jacksonville, Ill. He held Bachelor and Master of Science degrees from the University' of Illinois and in 1929 received a Ph.D. in chemistry at Northwestern University.

1328-> DUBLIN BARS A PLAN TO HONOR KENNEDY
DUBLIN, Jan. 3 (Reuters)—The Lord Mayor of Dublin, Sean Moore, said today that the City Council had no power to replace a statue of Lord NeIson with one of President Kennedy. Mr. Moore said he had receiv ed a letter from Michael J. Quill, president of the Transport Workers Union in the United States, suggesting that the substitution be made at the union's expense. “Neither I nor the City Council has the power to touch the Nelson pillar.” Mr. Moore said. “New legislation would be needed for such a change. I have written to Mr. Quill telling him this.” However, he added, the city had been studying a number of suggestions that a statue of Mr. Kennedy be erected. Dublin engineers have estimated it would cost about 20‚000 pounds $56‚000 ) to remove the 132‐foot statue of Admiral Nelson from its spot in the center of the city.

1329-> Dr. William E. Weld Dies at 82; Former Head of Wells College
UTICA, N. Y., Jan. 23 (AP) —Dr. William E. Weld, former president of Wells College, died today in St. Luke's Memorial Hospital. He was 82 years old and lived in Clinton. Dr. Weld was president of the college at Aurora from 1936 to 1948, when he retired. Dr. Weld was a professor of economics at Columbia University from 1919 to 1929. He received a Ph.D. there in 1920.

1331-> TREASURY BILLS QUIET AND STEADY; Massachusetts Utility Issue Syndicate Is Dissolved
Government bond prices the new year with declines. Bonds: Governments Decline on Selling by Commercial Banks Corporate underwriters ended the syndicate that has been offering $10 million of Massachusetts Electric Company bonds and the issue dropped about 1⅜ points; otherwise the corporate market was quiet and little changed. Municipal bond trading also was dull. Declines in Government bonds ranged from 1‐32 to 4‐32, with most of them concentrated among issues maturing from five to 10 years. Several dealers attributed the selling that caused the declines to commercial banks. A Dealer Explains “A lot of the banks decided they would register losses early in the year,” one dealer stated. "Maybe it's a little early for January reinvestment demand to show up, but we should have seen a little,” another trader said. Treasury bills, which traded actively Tuesday as commercial banks purchased the shortterm securities in heavy volume to “window dress” their 1963 year‐end statements, were quieter yesterday. Prices generally were unchanged for the day. Most Government bonds maturing in 1980 and beyond closed unchanged from Tuesday. In the corporate section of the market, the Massachusetts Electric first mortgage bonds were quoted late yesterday at 101⅛ bid, 101 ⅜ asked, down from their original offering price Dec. 4 of 102.547 to yield 4.47 per cent. At their reduced price, the bonds yield about 4.55 per cent. The Massachusetts Electric issue was unofficially estimated to have been about 40 per cent sold when the syndicate was broken yesterday at noon. Con Ed Quote Consolidated Edison Company of New York first and refunding bonds, released from syndicate Monday, were quoted at 101⅜ bid, 101⅝ asked yesterday. This is up ⅛ from Tuesday but down from an original offering price of 102.046. Municipal bond dealers reported inactivity and few remarkable price changes. “It was even quieter than before New Year's when there was some tax‐swapping at least,” one dealer said. He said the market probably would remain quiet until investors see how California's $60 million of veteran bonds and $20 million of schooI bonds are accepted next Tuesday. In addition, 29 issues of tax‐exempt local housing authority bonds totaling $140,255,000 will be offered Jan. 15. These, too, will help set the January tone of the municipals market, this dealer stated.

1333-> Drift by Cambodia Alarming the West
SAIGON, South Vietnam, 12—South Vietnamese and Western officials are alarmed by Cambodia's steady drift toward the Communist orbit. Diplomatic observers said today that Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's chief of state, seemed bent on recognizing the Communist regime of North Vietnam as the government for all Vietnam. Such Cambodian action would make it more difficult for the Saigon Government to prosecute the war against the Communist guerrillas, who are supported by Hanoi. The Vietcong are believed to be already making some clandestine use of Cambodia as a sanctuary and entrepôt for supplies. The Hanoi radio reported that Gen. Lon Nol, the Cambodian Defense Minister, who is on his way to Peking and Moscow for military talks and arms purchases, had stopped off in Hanoi. In Pnompenh, the Cambodian capital, Prince Sihanouk said last night that a five‐member delegation would leave for Hanoi in a few days to neogtiate a border‐demarcation agreement and a treaty of nonaggression and friendship with North Vietnam. Travelers from Pnompenh reported the city was quiet after violent demonstrations yesterday in which the United States and British embassies were damaged. Hsinhua, the Chinese Communist press agency, quoted Prince Sihanouk as having said that the proposed nonagression treaty with North Vietnam would not constitute a military alliance. A dispatch from Pnompenh reported Prince Sihanouk had said that Cambodia “would probably remain neutral.” Diplomatic officials said Prince Sihanouk was inviting ’ a clash with South Vietnam by seeking a border demarcation agreement with Hanoi. Any such agreement would imply recognition of Hanoi as the government for all Vietnam because Cambodia has a common frontier only with South Viet nam. Prince Sihanouk's approach to Hanoi seems to make it inevitable that South Vietnamese forces will feel less inhibited about pursuing the Vietcong guerrillas across the Cambodian border. The Cambodian leader rejected on Monday a United States proposal that Cambodia set up joint commissions with South Vietnam and Thailand to demarcate disputed borders. Insisting on his own definition of the borders, Prince Sihanouk accused the United States of plotting with Thailand and Cambodia to partition his country. The United States had suggested that the border be adjudicated as a preliminary step toward convening of fourpower conference to guarantee Cambodian neutrality and territorial integrity. United States officials are still awaiting a formal reply from Pnompenh, but the events of the week have discouraged them. Officials here believe that Prince Sihanouk has been motivated by a conviction that the Communists will win in Southeast Asia and he must accommodate himself to the paramount position of Peking. Diplomatic reports from Pnompenh said that the demonstration against the United States and British embassies yesterday appeared to have been organized by the Government. Cambodian officials and two propaganda loudspeaker trucks were reported in the crowd. The police on the scene were said to have done little to stop the demonstrators as they sacked the embassies.

1337-> AROUND AUSTRALIA; Study Finds Tourists Admire the People
SYDNEY — The Australian National Travel Association set out recently to ascertain what the foreign visitor liked best about this country. The predominant answer, based on hundreds of interviews and questionnaires, was the friendliness and helpfulness of the people. The survey thus helped to confirm what Australians have long suspected from their own contacts with tourists, to wit: Australia, for all the strangeness of its scenery, flora and fauna, feels like home to many foreigners, particularly Americans. Observers here believe there is more behind this than the common language. They contend that Americans find this continent, which is slightly smaller than the United States, an echo of their own land as it is today and as it was 100 years ago. The bushland, which comes to the edges of the great cities of Australia's southeastern region, is strange to the Americans, but the cities themselves are not. Both Sydney and Melbourne, especially Sydney, have the look and the feel of modern American cities. In the sparsely peopled interior, particularly on the sheep and cattle ranches, American visitors often break into nostalgic talk of the United States frontier lands of a century ago. Most visitors concentrate on the southeastern quarter of Australia, the most densely populated region. In recent years, however, both Australian and foreign holidayers have shown an increased interest in the frontier country and natural wonders, such as Queensland's Great Barrier Reef. Sydney is the usual point of entry for overseas visitors to Australia, particularly those from North America. This city of more than two million people is built around one of the finest natural harbors in the world, and is recognized today as Australia's freest and gayest metropolis. Between Sydney and Melbourne lie the Australian Alps and, at their northern edge, Canberra, the Federal capital. Canberra is a city in the making, growing along lines designed by an American architect, the late Walter Burley Griffin. After a hesitant beginning 51 years ago, it is now growing faster than any other Australian city. Melbourne, whose history goes back 129 years, has many similarities with Sydney, which it is now challenging for the title of the biggest city in Australia. It shares Sydney's interest in theater and restaurant life, but it bears the reputa tion of conducting itself with a little more dignity. It is a house‐proud city, with beautiful public parks and miles of carefully tended home gardens. It takes satisfaction from being a planned city, whereas Sydney's central business area is the result of meandering wagon trails. Australia's population is mainly urban, but the belief persists, among both Australians and visitors, that the real Australia and real Australians are to be found in the farming and stock‐raising districts. A quick introduction to “The Real Australia” is available to visitors to Sydney in the form of airplane excursions to sheep and cattle properties in western New South Wales.

1338-> Arrested U.S. Student Denies Poles' Charge; Didn't Strike Border Official, Jersey Traveler Insists—Free on Bail in Warsaw
WARSAW, Feb. 1—An American student arrested in Poland on charges of having struck a Polish border official and used offensive language toward him. denied categorically today that he had done either. The student is Andrew Field, a 26‐year‐old Harvard University graduate who has been in Moscow since September as an change student. Mr. Field. son of Dr. and Mrs. Harry Field of 60 Duffield Drive, South Orange, N. J., was taken off a train and arrested Jon. 21 at the Polish‐East German border town of Slubice. At the time he was en route from Moscow to Paris for a two‐week holiday with his wife, Audrey. The incident that led to the charges against him occurred earlier that day at a station across the country at the Polish‐Soviet border. Mr. Field was held in jail in Lublin, in Eastern Poland, and later in Warsaw from Jan. 23 until he was released yesterday on the equivalent of $3,000 bail supplied by his parents through the United States Embassy in Warsaw. No date has been set for his trial. The slender, bespectacled student whose field of study is Russian literature, told his story in an embassy office. He said that in arranging their trip to Paris he and his wife had applied for Polish transit visas that would be valid until Feb. 6. However, officials told them when the train arrived at the Polish border that the visas had expired Jan. 6. Mr. Field said he did not wish to go into details of the discussion he had had with the border authorities, since this might prejudice his position during his trial. He repeated, however, his denial of the charges, which he suggested might have resulted from a “linguistic misunderstanding”; on the part of the Polish official, with whom he was speaking in Russian. “I certainly meant no offense”; he added. Mr. Field said he and his wife got back on the train after the discussion, thinking the matter had been cleared up. He said that they had been told they would be given new visas at the East German frontier and that they had even paid for them. However, when the train arrived at that frontier, they were taken off without being told what was happening. They were kept for a few hours at the border station, then driven to a hotel in Slubice, where they stayed until late the following day, Mr. Field said. During that period Mr. Field was able to telephone the United States consulate in Poznan, Poland, to inform officials of his predicament, he said. That evening, a week ago Wednesday, Mr. Field and his wife were taken back to the border station. Accompanied by three armed guards, he was put on an eastbound train. His wife was permitted to board the next train to Berlin the following morning. Mr. Field was taken almost all the way across Poland to Lublin, where he underwent a four ‐ hour interrogation and was placed in the town jail for the night. The following day he was transferred to a bigger prison in the same city. American consular officials were given permission to see him there on Friday, Jan. 24. and the following day he was transferred to a prison in Warsaw. His wife, who is in Berlin, is reported to have applied for a Polish visa to return to her husband. Mr. Field said he had prepared an anthology of Russian literature, entitled “Pages From Tarusa,”; that is scheduled for publication in the United States this month. He will be tried in the district court at Biala Podlaska, near the Soviet border. Under Polish law, using abusive or offensive language to an officer of the state is punishable by a prison sentence of up to two years. The maximum sentence for striking an officer of the state is five years.

1340-> ARLIE FURMAN GIVES VIOLIN RECITAL HERE
Arlie Furman, violinist, barely recovered from illness, nevertheless began her Town Hall recital as scheduled last night. However, she had to make an, unscheduled stop after the first movement of the César Franck sonata because of dizziness. She declared an intermission right there, and she was attended by a physician. Finally, Miss Furman bravely came on stage to play the first performance of an Elegy for Maurice Wilk (1963) by Otto Luening. Mr. Wilk, violinist of the Bach Aria group, died just a year ago. His widow was in the audience, as was Mr. Luening. Miss Furman continued with her listed program, having itted only the final three ovements of the Franck. Mr. Luenings elegy is written for violin alone. It is broadly melodic, and restrained but s rong in feeling. It would proba bly have been broader and stronger still, had Miss Furman not been ill. The same can be said of the rest of the program, which included works by Fritz Kreisler, Deems Taylor, Mozart and Wienawski. Miss Furman also played Mr. Luenings “Gargoyles” for violin and electronic sounds. Anthony Kooiker was her excellent accompanist.

1342-> SHIPPING OFF 1.66% FOR CANALS IN 1963
Cargo tonnage on the New York State Barge Canal sys­tem during 1963 dropped 1.66 per cent below the 1962 figure according to a report issued last week by the Public Works De­partment. The slight decline, to 3,225,­526 tons, was attributed to a 31‐day suspension of service on part of the Erie Canal, where a washout occurred. Petroleum products, general­ly the largest single item car­ried on the waterway system, totaled 2,471,498 tons, an in­crease of 70,218 tons. Cargoes of cement, lime, scrap iron, wheat and salt also increased. Decreases were reported in shipments of pig iron and bil­lets, iron or steel articles, sugar, paper products, chemicals and drugs, corn and agricultural oils. The report said 40.22 per cent of the total tonnage originated in the state for delivery in the state, compared with 36.5 per cent in 1962. .

WASHINGTON, Feb. 13—Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, Democrat of Minnesota, will ask the Food and Drug Administration at a hearing early next month what it plans to do about testing the effectiveness of drugs. Until the Kefauver Drug Act of 1962. the Government had the power to require proof only of the safety of new drugs. Next October, after a two‐year grace period set by the act, the effectiveness of drugs will also be subject to proof. A source at the subcommittee of the Senate Government Operations Committee that will conduct the hearings said that the Senator had indicated that pediatric drugs—medicines used on premature infants, infants and small children—would be among those about which the subcommittee would inquire. This source said that some pediatric drugs on the market had not been tested as to their effectiveness. At present the F.D.A. is conducting an intensive review of pediatric drugs as to safety as well. The subcommittee will seek testimony from F.D.A. officials about the need for such review.

1356-> But Jordan's King Sees No Possibility of Improving Arab‐Israeli Relations
JERUSALEM (Jordanian Sector), Jan. 2—King Hussein expressed today “our most earnest hope” that Pope Paul VI's pilgrimage to the Holy Land would not only bring together Christian sects but would aLso herald a new era of understanding and cooperation between Christians and Moslems. But he added in reply to a question that he did not see how such hope for understanding could be expressed about relations between Arabs and Israelis. Addressing several hundred newsmen gathered here for Pope Paul's visit, the King said of his country's relations with “occupied Palestine”: “The problem is a different one—it is a matter of injustice. And until there's a just and honorable conclusion to this problem I hardly see how relations could be improved. “I feel it is a duty to try to find that just solution. But until people of occupied territory are willing to remedy the wrongs they committed—and not by use of force—I don't see how progress toward a solution can be made.” Pope Paul is scheduled to arrive in Amman, Jordan's capital, on Saturday, first day of his three‐day pilgrimage. He will go to Israel Sunday, return to Jordan that night and leave for Rome the following day. The 30‐year‐old King came from Amman this morning for a news conference in the Alhambra Theater here. He read a statement and then answered questions in EngIish. When he departed he drove his own car amid a crowd of about a thousand outside the theater. King Hussein noted that more than a million persons who were driven from their homes in the 1948 Arab‐Israeli war still Iived refugees. In that war Israel repulsed invasions by Arab neighbors after Israel had been declared an independent state. “The feeling in the Arab world,” the King said, “is that Israel as it stands has designs and plans to carry out further aggression and to expand at our expense.” On the problem of Israeli diversion of Jordan River water, the King said he would consult with other Arab leaders in Cairo and would abide by their decision. The meeting will take: place Jan. 13. Israel, despite Arab objects, is going ahead with project to tap the ri e r's wate for the arid Negev. The projec is part of a larger one, worked out under American auspices to use common water resources to irrigate the desert on the Arab, as well as the Israeli side of the border. The Arabs, however, oppos any joint enterprise that would benefit Israel. In his prepared statementKing Hussein said that he refused to believe “that the Christian world would countenance and acquiesce in the diversion and almost complete obliteration of the River Jordan, with all its precious and historic religious associations, as the Israelis seem bent on doing.

1358-> F.D.A. Seeks Report On Effects of Drugs Developed Since'38
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (AP) —The Food and Drug Administration published today new regulations intended to show whether thousands of drugs developed since 1938 are effective and whether they cause harmful side effects. The regulations constitute a second major step in carrying out a law passed in 1962 that establishes much closer Federal surveillance over medications. That statute was inspired, in part, by disclosure of hundreds of birth deformities that were traced to pregnant women's use of the tranquilizing drug thalidomide. Since last June 20 reports on efficacy and side effects have been required for all new drugs. Today's action is aimed at the thousands of others developed between 1938 and last June 20. The industry and other terested parties will be allowed 30 days to comment on the regulations before their publication in final form. After that, manufacturers w ill be required to report within 30 days whether drugs developed between 1938 and last June 20 are still on the market, and to file within the following 60 days reports on the effectiveness, safety and side effects of such drugs and antibiotics. Malcolm R. Stephens, assistant commissioner of the agency, noted that under the new regulations manufacturers would be required to report at once any known instances of adverse side effects from their medications. He said that several recent cases of injuries to patients taking certain drugs might have been averted if this prompt reporting requirement had been in effect. The revision of the drug law in 1962 allowed two years for proof of efficacy, with the deadline next Oct. 10. But officials are hopeful that it will be possible to gather the data necessary for publication of final findings before Oct. 10.

1359-> Michigan Legislature Backs School Prayer
LANSING, Mich., Feb. 12 (UFI)—The Michigan Legislature voted today in favor of prayer in the public schools. It adopted a resolution asking Congress to propose a Constitutional amendment to the effect that “freedom of religion shall include the right to offer prayer in public schools. The House of Representatives, after a half‐hour of stormy debate, concurred with the Senate in favor of the resolution, 76 to 26. Senator Milton Zaagman Republican of Grand Rapids, sponsored the resolution, sayat one time that ultra‐liberals were trying to force religion out of the nation. The main opponent of the proposal was Senator Charles Blondy, Democrat of Detroit, who pointed out the United States Supreme Court decision against such prayers and the opposition of various religious groups in Michigan to the resolution.

1360-> Personality: Trucker Resists the Fashion; Chief of Associated Keeps Emphasis on Small Shipments
  The fashion in trucking today is to integrate the truck line with the railroad via one of the several piggy ‐ back modes. James K. Seymour, new president of Associated Transport, Inc., the nation's third largest trucking company, is making a lot of money by resisting the fashion. Associated Transport derives about 75 per cent of its revenues from handling lessthan‐trailer‐load traffic between Boston and Charleston, S. C., along the Eastern Seaboard. This 1.‐t.‐1. traffic is the sort of business that most railroads‐ would not know what to do with now. Moreover, because the average haul is less than 500 miles, most railroads and piggy‐back trucking lines could not handle it profitably. Associated Transport's predecessor companies did conduct some piggy‐back business 25 years ago between Boston and New York, Mr. Seymour acknowledged in a recent interview. “It didn't prove too practical,” he said, adding “having to meet train deadlines we lost the flexibility of truck movement. There are several reasons why we haven't gone back into it. ● “The first reason I suppose is we have always done it the truck way. A second reason might be simply inertia. A third is we belive we could encounter substantial difficulties with the Teamsters Union, which after all gets $5 for every trailer moved piggy‐back. “But there are other good reasons. “The great growth in piggy ‐ back has been in east ‐ west traffic. Our major traffic is north‐south where piggy ‐ back is no immediate threat. We operate in a highly competitive trucking area. “Our longest haul is about 485 miles and our shipments are small. Not only is 75 per cent of our revenue from but 90 per cent of our shipments are less ‐ than ‐ trailerload. We haven't lost any business by not moving some of our traffic piggy‐back. We could, I suppose, find things changing, and we would change with the times. But the time for change hasn't arrived as yet.” Mr. Seymour, a native of Milwaukee, was born on June 21, 1923. He admits he got to be the $65,000‐a‐year president of Associated Transport last August by being the son of the 70‐year‐old chairman of the board, Burge M. Seymour. “Ask any president's son,” he said, “and if he's a candid sort of a guy he'll tell you that being a president's son is never a handicap.” Frankness aside, Mr. Seymour's rise to the top was by no means up the ladder of nepotism. Over the last 20 years he has trained in all departments of the system. The directors of Associated Transport, one of the line's competitors commented, aren't given to sentiment. “They voted Jim the job,” he said, “because they believed he could do it. Moreover, there is no secret he is given much of the credit for making the company the money‐maker it is.” ● Associated, which is one of the few transportation corpanies whose profits are so large that it is in the 52 per cent Federal tax bracket, is expected to report shortly a net income for 1963 of $4.06 a share. This would compare with earnings of $4.02 a share in 1962, when it was accruing tax reserves at a 35 per cent level. On a 52 per cent basis, the 1962 net would have been $3.43 a share. Achieving these profits was not easy. In fact, Associated didn't clear $1 million until 1959. The company was put together in 1941 by a banking group headed by Lehman Brothers and Kuhn, Loeb & Co. It was formed from seven small lines that had been family‐owned and doggedly independent. The presumed economies of large‐scale operation were hard to come by. The volume of business was there, but a lot of it was business that cost as much to handle as it brought in or a little more. Over the years the management gradually reduced its costs and began find ing more business that could be handled with existing facilities. As Mr. Seymour put it, “we often found ourselves scraping the bottom of the barrel as far as getting costs below revenues. When that happened we had to look around for a new barrel to open. “It wasn't until late 1961, when Mr. Seymour became operational chief and executive vice president, that Associated decided it could cut its maintenance costs significantly by trading in its entire road fleet every three years —just before the first major overhaul would be due. Last September the directors finally felt sufficiently sure of continuing profits to declare the first dividend on the common stock. They put the shares on a regular 25cent quarterly basis. In November they ordered a yearextra payment of 10 cents a share. Last week the dividend was raised to 30 cents a share. “I'll admit the dividend had been a little conservative,” Mr. Seymour said, “but we wanted to walk before we ran.” Mr. Seymour said he believed that Associated might even be ready to start on a new expansion program. He said that the company has been talking merger with several smaller motor carriers. “The discussions have reached the point where everyone is talking seriously. I can say as a matter of policy if it isn't Joe, it is going to be Mike and if not Mike it will be Harry.” Jim Seymour grew up in Westchester County and was graduated in 1939 from Mamaroneck High School. His first job was as a loader and truck “jockey” in Buffalo for the M. Moran Motor Lines, one of the seven concerns that finally became Associated. “That first job was a real tough one,” he recalled. “I don't mean the work, but the climate.” Early in 1942 he went into the Army as a private and three and one‐half years later was discharged as a master sergeant. ● He works a 14 ‐ hour day now that he is the boss. That is without a lunch break. said he considers going out for lunch “a waste of time.” Through the noon hour he continues business at his desk —over sandwiches. In his off‐time he is a householder. He acts his role of a 40‐year‐old father with five children more than his other part of an affluent executive. That may come later. Right now, he said, he is getting “a real bang” out of teaching his wife, the former Joan Van Winkle, and the children to sail, ski, and play tennis. The Seymour home is a 14room house on a four‐acre tract in Easton, Conn., outside Westport. The house is Jim Seymour's pride. One part of it was built in 1725. He and his wife have filled it with early American antiques. Last year they gardened profusely —and expensively. “Our carrots probably cost $15 apiece,” he grinned. and then explained that he had found it necessary to fence the garden space “only find the raccoons scaling the fenca”

1363-> GOD'S OWN JUNKYARD: The Planned Deterioration of America's Landscape. By Peter Blake. Ilus­trated. 144 pp. New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston Cloth, $4.50. Paper, $2.95.; America the Beautiful, Defaced, Mutilated
IN the early nineteen‐fifties, a special issue of The British Architectural Review appeared, devoted to “Man‐Made America.” Its conclusion was that man‐made America was a mess, and it provided some eye‐opening shocks for its professional readers. American indictments of the American scene followed, and now we have a book with the same theme aimed at the broadest possible audience. “God's Own Junkyard,” says its author, Peter Blake, is a “muckraking” book with a message. “It is not written in anger. It is written in fury. It is a deliberate attack upon all those who have befouled a large portion of this country for private gain, and are engaged in befouling the rest.” Its message is simple and explicit. Man can ruin anything, and does. The shining country that stretched from sea to sea, the skies, the plains, the woods, the spacious fields, are now defaced and mutilated — a babel of billboards, auto graveyards, googie architecture and subdivision devastation; all the appurtenances and excrescences of prosperity, the population explosion and the good life. It has been amputation by expressway and slaughter by suburban sprawl. Mr. Blake's book is a primer on the uglification of America the Beautiful. Ironically, it is aimed at an audience that has ceased to see, that accepts the chaotic squalor it has created and lives in its own esthetic filth. It is addressed to a people whose philosophy is pragmatism and a country that maintains an almost mystical belief in the sanctity of free enterprise and the ultimate good of private profit. That both the beliefs and the people are blind is shown by this documentation of the destruction of the country's landscape and history. And that the results are less than practical is proved by the waste and loss of the country's irretrievable natural and architectural heritage. At the present rate of exploitation, the author says the future will be culturally and esthetically bankrupt. Mr. Blake, who is managing editor of Architectural Forum and author of “The Master Builder,” presents his argument against the “planned deterioration” of our landscape with cool skill. His case for an ordered and beautiful environment is based on hard, incontrovertible facts: the impracticality of waste which destroys economic values as well as esthetic amenities; the real planning failures of suburbia that are as serious as its flagrant abuses of the land; the destruction of the city in terms of prosperity and livability as it becomes increasingly repellent under the hand of the speculative developer; the automobile's promise of pleasure and liberation turned into dismemberment of the city, the defiling of nature and the compounding of chaos with congestion. Much of the story is told in the generous illustrations of this handsomely designed book —which has been aided by a grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts. Pictures are frequently paired for startling, heaven‐hell contrasts. Salt Lake City's neon honkytonk faces the architectural serenity of Boston's Beacon Hill, orderly Jeffersonian elegance at the Uni versity of Virginia rebukes the commercial disaster of Canal Street in New Orleans, Park Avenue before and after Pan Am is a searing indictment of a brutal destruction of scale, detrition by Detroit turns rolling country into asphalt parking lots. The impact on a sensitive eye is bruising. Unfortunately, the public eye is not sensitive, and does not bruise easily. It has even become increasingly inured to shock. It is doubtful that the average American would recognize it if he were set down in the Garden of Eden. It is also doubtful whether this striking but sophisticated selection of photographs, with such an obvious moral to those who deal in visual truths, will disturb him any more than the awful reality. They are an instrument for seeing, however, if enough people look; but they presuppose the reader's ability to distinguish between good and bad. For the most part, he is adjusted to his self‐made atrocities and sets his sights no higher. This is the real tragedy of the American Dream, the irony of peace and plenty—that we have settled for the poor, the mean and the ugly in our inescapable physical environment.

1364-> PERU LAYS CLASH TO RURAL MISERY; Premier Says Reds Did Not Have Primary Role
LIMA, Peru, Feb. 8—Premier Fernando Schwalb Lopez Aldana disagreed today with reports in leading newspapers that the blame for violence and land seizure in the mountainous farm regions of Peru lay with Communist agitators. Dr. Lolez Aldafia said that a highly skilled minority of Communist‐trained agitators did play a role, but that the roots of the trouble lay in the feudal agricultural practices and the misery of the Indians. The Premier said in an interview that a population surge in the rural areas had led up to the current crisis. The Premier said Peru needed considerable aid under the Alliance for Progress program to raise the status of millions of Indians through farm credits, technical schools, health centers and rural roads. He believes there is considerable lack of understanding of Peru's problems both in the United States Congress and in the country as a whole. He sees a need to “advertise” the Alliance more within the United States and to point out such conditions as those that exist in mountainous farm areas around Cuzco, the old Inca capital. Last Tuesday policemen in Cuzco Department clashed with thousands of Indian peasants who had occupied private grain mills and private farmland. Nineteen Indians were killed. The police said they had to fire after overwhelming numbers of peasants had attacked them with stones and firearms. Dr. Lopez Aldafia said that a highly skilled minority of Communist ‐ trained agitators was taking advantage of the misery of the Indians to lead them in Invasions of private lands. But he said the Communists were not entirely to blame. The Premier said that Indians in the high Sierra regions of Peru lived in feudal conditions under which they could not receive enough to live on. An Indian may “rent” land from a proprietor and pay for the right to squat there by working for the landowner, the Premier said. If he is paid cash for various services it is at a rate of less than 10 American cents a day, he added. In scattered regions of the country, Indians, encouraged by various educated leaders, including law students, national Deputies and occasionally rural officials, have marched onto private farms crying, “Land or death.” The Premier said that some leaders were Communists. He said that attempts to put the full blame for conditions on Communists was “worsening the situation.” He deplored the idea of a witch hunt that could destroy democracy in Peru. “It is necessary to correct rural feudal problems at their roots,” he emphasized. President Fernando Belaiundes Terry's Government has the backing of opposition parties in pressing a measure designed to permit the expropriation of certain large or poorly worked farms and estates for redistribution. Persons who lost lands would have the right to appeal and would also be compensated in full with 5‐per‐cent bonds maturing in 20 years. So far the measure has passed the lower house and approved with amendments by the Senate is expected in a few weeks. Dr. Schwalb declared that cutting up farm land and handing it over to Indians would solve nothing without intensive aid and education. Peru is relying heavily on Alliance aid to supply credit to the new farmers and to build schools, roads and health centers. Since pre‐Inca times the Indian population has been concentrated in Andean plateau and valley regions two miles above sea level. Some areas are fertile but extremely isolated from markets because of the terrain. A major part of the Government program is the construction of roads to potential markets. This month close to $1 million worth of road‐building machinery is scheduled to be delivered under the Alliance to the Cuzco area. Cuzco was still tense this weekend. The Government has rounded up more than 50 persons accused of having instigated the resistance to the police near Sicuani last Tuesday and has flown in 200 assault policemen.

1365-> Multi‐Campus Concept Now Adapted for Secondary Schools; 4 CENTERS SLATED IN PLAN ON COAST; Athenian Institution Near San Francisco Will Open First Unit in 1965
SAN FRANCISCQ. The multi‐campus school concept, already a success on the higher educational level, will soon become part of the secondary school scene here. The new Athenian School, 30 miles east of San Francisco, will incorporate in its plans a schedule for adding separate campuses. This is the pattern successfully adopted by Oxford University and California's Claremont Colleges, and in a modified version by some “houseplan” public schools such as those of Fairfield, Conn. The school will open its first campus in September, 1965, with 30 to 50 boys in grades 9 and 10, adding grades 11 and 12 in succeeding years and making the transition to a coeducational school in the fourth and fifth years. When the first campus has reached its goal of approximately 120 students and 16 faculty, a second, third and fourth campus will be added in succession until the total enrollment reaches 500 with a faculty of 65. Each campus will be similar in size and program, and each will have its own name, student body, faculty, dormitories and classrooms. Entering students will be admitted to a designated campus and will remain there for their years at the school. As the individual campuses are built, certain central facilities will be constructed to serve all campuses: a library, a science center, athletic fields and play areas, an auditorium large enough for all the students anda central infirmary. Most of the student's classeswill be held on his own campus. Large lecture courses will, however, be planned for students from all campuses and students will be entitled to take special or advanced courses given by teachers on another campus. The school's curriculum will offer courses in the standard secondary fields of English, mathematics, science, history, social studies and foreign languages. A special course in public affairs will be offered based in part on a grant from the Ford Foundation. Students will have an opportunity to do independent and advanced work in seminars, tutorials and individual research projects. The name, the Athenian School, was selected “in order to evoke the goals of education that Athens valued in its concern for the full development of its citizens: first, concern for intellectual fitness and development of the power of reason, and second, concern for the personal and civic development of each individual.”

1366-> BYRD STEPS ASIDE IN TAX BILL FIGHT; Yields Floor Manager's Job —Won't Hinder Passage
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26—Senator Harry F. Byrd, still unconvinced of the need for tax relief, has quietly stepped aside as manager of the Administration's $11.5 billion tax reduction and reform bill. The conservative Virginia Democrat, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, disclosed today that he had delegated the task to Senator Russell B. Long of Louisiana. Mr. Long is the second‐ranking Democrat on the committee. Senator Byrd was largely responsible for a speedup that resulted in the bill's approval by a 12‐to‐5 vote in the Finance Committee last Thursday. The extent of his cooperation with the Johnson Administration in hastening the vote had led to speculation that he might handle the measure on the Senate floor. However, Senator Byrd voted against the bill Thursday and then asked Senator Long to take over as floor manager, a role ordinarily discharged by the committee chairman. In an interview, Senator Byrd said he was pleased with President Johnson's success in reducing the Federal budget for the fiscal year starting next July. “But it is only $500 million below this year's expenditure,” he said, “and while I want to give the President full credit, it is still about $5 billion above last year's.” “I don't feel it is the right thing to do to cut taxes without a greater reduction in expenditures. That has been my position from the beginning,” he declared. Senator Byrd emphasized, however, that he would not obstruct passage of the bill “in any way.” Democratic leaders plan to call the measure up a week from tomorrow, They hope to meet President Johnson's target of Feb. 11 for passage. This would send the bill to a conference committee to adjust differences between House and Senate versions, possibly in time for final Congressional action by the end of February. The Administration's civil rights bill, which the President is pressing with equal vigor, is expected to be taken up by the House next Friday. Representative Howard W. Smith, Democrat of Virginia, has said that the Rules Committee, of which he is chairman, will conclude hearings and clear the measure to the floor on Thursday. Democratic leaders have arranged to complete debate and pass the bill by Feb. 11, the day before Lincoln's Birthday. Congress plans to suspend work for about a week after that to allow Republicans to participate in Lincoln day oratory throughout the country. After the Senators return debate will begin on the civil rights bill. It has not yet been decided, however, whether to delay debate until the final version of the tax bill emerges from conference and is approved by the Senate. President Johnson will send to Congress tomorrow his first special message with detailed recommendations for new legislation. The message is expected to call for the expansion of programs to provide housing for the poor in both urban and rural areas. It will also deal with problems in the growth of surburban communities. In disavowing any desire to obstruct the tax bill. Senator Byrd said he intended to vote against its passage, but would not try to bring about its defeat. He said he would explain his position in a brief speech when he presented the bill to the Senate and formally turned it over to Senator Long's management.

1367-> BUSINESSMEN SEE CENTER A REALITY; Port Authority Project Stirs Restrained Optimism
The Port of New York Authority's plans for a soaring twin‐tower World Trade Center on the lower West Side were greeted yesterday with guarded enthusiasm by business and realty spokesmen with intimate knowledge of the downtown area. The cautiousness stemmed from the awareness that the ambitious $350 million project, which will have the world's tallest buildings, each 1,350 feet, still has a number of obstacles to overcome before it actually emerges. The general feeling, however, is that the Port Authority has a good chance to succeed in the proposed undertaking, even if the center is modified in some respects. The main reason for optimism about such a gigantic project is the nature of its sponsorship. In realty circles it is acknowledged that only a public agency such as the Port Authority could marshal the financial and other resources needed to build a center with 10 million square feet of office space together with a hest of supporting facilities. A second favorable element is the ardent interest of the Rockefeller family in the World Trade Center. The interest is multi‐faceted — civil, political and commercial. In that connection, some of the opposition to the center cites the Rockefeller interest in it. Yesterday, for instance, State Senator Jack E. Bronston, Democrat of Queens, charged that Governor Rockefeller “is going to bail out the center.” “It's no secret,”he said, “that the Chase Manhattan Bank is interested in it.” David Rockefeller, a brother of the Governor and president of the Chase Manhattan Bank, is the moving spirit behind the Downtown‐Lower Manhattan Association, which for many years has sought to revitalize the southern tip of the island. The association first proposed the center. Although, like New York City, the city's private builders and realty men are comparative bystanders in the project, they generally wish it well: Several prominent real estate men commended the plan yesterday. Robert S. Curtiss, president of Horace S. Ely & Co., a former director of real estate for the Port Authority, said the project was “sound” and “vitally needed.” Of the 10 million square feet, four million will be rented to private business, the rest to state and Federal agencies. Mr. Curtiss pointed out that not all of this space would be thrown on the market at once but over a period of years. “The way it's planned,” he said, “it will cause the least disruption ot the realty market. Business concerns will move from older buildings, but they won't move all at once, and it should be possible for the space they vacate to be absorbed normally by business expansion.” Gordon I. Kyle, president of the Cruikshank Company, pointed out that the new center was expected to bring 500,000 more people into the area each day. The project is planned for a 16‐acre site bounded by Church, Vesey, Liberty and West Streets. “This will mean a good deal more business for the banks, the merchants and the other business interests downtown,” Mr. Kyle said. Not all the businessmen in the area are happy about the project. The Downtown West Businessmen's Association says that 325 stores will have to be demolished to make way for the center, affecting the livelihoods of 30,000 owners and employes and their families. Senator Bronston said he planned to raise the voice of opposition in the State Legislature “every day.” He contended that the state would be paying $3 million to $6 million a year for office space in the new center, in contrast to the $1,3 75,000 it pays in maintenance costs for its buildings at 80 Centre Street and 270 Broadway. “In order to be able to get money to balance his budget, the Governor will sell those buildings,” Senator Bronston said, “and in order to help the trade center he'll rent space in it for the state.” The World Trade Center had originally been planned for the Lower East Side of Manhattan, but New Jersey refused to go along with the project unless it was transferred to the West Side. Under the compact setting up the bistate Port Authority, any of its undertakings must be approved by identical legislation of both New York and New Jersey. The center project also incorporates the rehabilitation of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Company facilities linking the lower West Side with New Jersey. Thus far the city's role in the project has been minimal; the Port Authority does not need prior approval by the city for its undertakings. Although Mayor Wagner said Saturday that details of the plan had not yet been presented to him, a Port Authority spokesman said yesterday that the Mayor “has been most cooperative throughout.” One of the talking points of proponents of the center is that Federal agencies are expected to rent space in the buildings. There have as yet been no specific commitments from Federal agencies. It was reported unofficially yesterday, however, that the Customs Service was planning to move into the Center when it was built.

1368-> Goldwater Goes to New Hampshire and Romney Speaks in Washington; GOLDWATER OPENS HIS PRIMARY DRIVE; Confers in New Hampshire With Aides—Romney Says He'd Accept Nomination
CONCORD, N. H., Jan. 7Senator Barry Goldwater began in low gear today his campaign for New Hampshire's 14 delegate votes for the Republican Presidential nomination. Still wearing a cast on his right foot, the Arizonan spent the day within a radius of mile or two of his headquarters on Main Street. He underwent surgery recently for the removal of a calcium spur on his right heel. Tonight, he dined and talked informally with an overflow crowd of state campaign workers at the New Hampshire Highway Hotel, where Governor Rockefeller of New York has his state campaign headquarters. Appeals for Party Unity Arrangements had been made for slightly more than 200 persons, but 431 dinners were served. Senator Goldwater pleaded for party unity and counseled against a primary contest “so embittered as to tear the party apart in the final campaign.” [In Washington, Gov. George Romney of Michigan said he was not actively seeking the Republican Presidential nomination but would not turn away from the opportunity if it were presented to him.] Governor Rockefeller spent two days in New Hampshire last week. He will return Thurs‐ Goldwater leaves, for a speech The Senator and the Governor are the only declared candidates so far for the March 10 primary here, the first of the Presidential campaign. Toward the end of the day, Senator Goldwater said he was “quite surprised and pleased with his visit sofar. “It is hard to sit in a hospital in the Southwest and judge just how far the effects of antiGoldwater talk have gone,” the Senator said. “I am pleased and surprised with several people here ” He did not identify these people: The Senator said he expected to spend two or three days a week in New Hampshire for the rest of the primary campaign, perhaps staying the last 10 days in the state. He said that he had been, taking several polls and that he believed there had been no change in his position as front‐runner. In a press conference this morning, the Senator said he had gained former President Dwight D. Eisenhower's ap proval of a paper on foreign ‘policy that he expected to publish in the next few days. But he said this did not mean General Eisenhower had approved his complete foreign policy position. In answer to a question about his dual candidacy for President and for Senator, he replied, “I am not really running for any office until I am nominated.” “My inclination has been not to run for the Senate,” he said, “and I would not have done so against President Kennedy, but I can now that I am running against a teacher.” He was referring to President Johnson's race in Texas for Senator in 1960, when he was also running for Vice President. The Arizonan said, “Johnson invented ‘policare,’ or the care of politicians, and since I am too young to quit politics and too old to go back to work, I'm going along with the idea.” The Senator said he would favor giving Gen. Lyman L. Lemnitzer, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, authority to fire tactical atomic weapons without referral to the White House. Senator Goldwater denied that lhee favored such authority for local commanders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

1369-> SHIPPING EVENTS: PICKETS DWINDLE; Only One Appears at Texas Loading of Soviet Wheat
HOUSTON, Feb. 10 (AP)—Only one picket appeared at the dock today as longshoremen continued to load a freighter with wheat bound for the Soviet Union. Robert M. Kennedy, 45 years old, a Houston cabinetmaker who led about 50 pickets yesterday, had said men, women and children would picket all ships that came to Houston to take on wheat for the Soviet Union. But Willie Wells, president of Local 1273 of the International Longshoremen's Association, said his men would work even if pickets tried to halt the loading of 600,000 bushels of wheat sold to the Soviet Union by the Continental Grain Company of New York. The loading, which began late Friday aboard the British freighter Inverewe, is more than three‐fourths completed. The pickets carried signs yesterday that read: “Why Trade Wheat for Bodies?” “Starve Communism,” “Don't Feed Killers,” “American Wheat for Americans,” and “Boston Tea Party and Houston Wheat Party.” Both Mr. Wells and Raymond Duncan, president of I.L.A. Local 872 said the sale had been approved by the Federal Government and the maritime unions. They suggested that any complaints be made to Federal authorities. A proposal that the Federal Government send a representative to the Soviet Union to determine whether Soviet ports could accommodate large, grain‐laden United States‐flag tankers was made yesterday by the American Maritime Association. Max Harrison; president of the shipping group, said the proposal was made in a telegram to Robert E. Giles, Acting Maritime Administrator. A spokesman for Mr. Harrison noted that Soviet authorities so far had refused admittance to Soviet ports to large United States grain‐carrying tankers. The Government representative would be asked to explore the possibility of lightening American tankers of 32,000 tons or more through partial offshore discharge into smaller vessels or barges before docking at Soviet Black Sea or Siberian ports.

1370-> GOLDWATER FINDS VOTER INDECISION; Calls for Military Moves Against Reds in Cuba
CONCORD, N. H., Jan. 23—Senator Barry Goldwater said today that he could sense widespread indecision among New Hampshire voters over his candidacy for the Republican Presidential nomination. For the third day, the Arizonan answered dozens of questions from adults and students who seemed eager to compare what he said with their often vague impressions of just how conservative he was. Mr. Goldwater said little that he had not said or written in the past, but his campaign performance was extremely arresting, nonetheless. He suggested new military attempts to oust Communism from Cuba. He indicated he would favor American withdrawal from the United Nations if Communist China were admitted. And he suggested that medical care for the aged under Social Security would undermine the American family and filial love. He also said that some people did not want to work. He asserted that the nuclear test ban treaty made it impossible to test the reliability of United States guided missiles and that Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara had destroyed more military morale than any of his predecessors. In addition, he declared that $5 to $7 billion a year could be trimmed from public spending and that trends toward “handouts and circuses” were threatening the United States with a fate comparable to that of Rome or ancient Egypt. On the other hand, he praised a number of Democratic policies, including President Johnson's handling of the Panama crisis, and seemed indifferent to any political uses that could be made of this support. Senator Goldwater gave firm answers to his critics, mostly college students. He told one, “If some of these colleges you fellows go to would start paying attention to the Constitution, I would feel safer about the future of the country.” Mr. Goldwater ended a three‐day tour of New Hampshire and flew back to Washington this evening. He faces Governor Rockefeller of New York and former Gov. Harold E. Stassen of Minnesota in the primary here March 10. Some delegates pledged to Henry Cabot Lodge, United States Ambassador to South Vietnam, will also be entered. It was announced last night that former Gov. Wesley Powell's name would be entered by some of his political associates. Senator Goldwater said today the number of names involved in the contest could “well lead to a meaningless primary” if voters spread their support widely and denied anyone an obvious victory. In a press conference at Laconia, the Senator said that in New Hampshire “I see a lot of indecision as far as I'm concerned.” He said he felt that most voters had made up their minds about Governor Rockefeller “but not on me.” He said it was not “difficult to read an audience and sense a little hesitancy here and there.” The Senator's campaign director, Stewart Lamprey, said that a poll taken last night in Meredith showed 699 persons undecided. Of those with firm opinions, Mr. Lamprey said, Senator Goldwater had 175 poll votes to 95 for others.

1371-> SHIRLEY NICHOLS, 79, EX-BISHOP OF KYOTO
The Right Rev. Shirley Hall Nichols, former Protestant Episcopal Bishop of Kyoto, Japan, died Tuesday in St. Luke's Hospital at the age of 79. He lived at 50 Oakwood Avenue in Upper Montclair, N. J. Bishop Nichols, after leaving Japan in 1940, became Bishop of the Salina (Kan.) missionary district, now the Diocese of Western Kansas, a post he held until his retirement in 1955. Bishop Nichols, a native of Brooklyn, was graduated from Harvard in 1905. After working for three years, he entered General Theological Seminary, where he was graduated in 1911. Becoming a deacon, he taught for four years at St. Paul's University in Tokyo. He then became priest in charge of the Hirosaki, Aomori and Odate missionary districts until his consecration as Bishop of Kyoto in April, 1926. Surviving are his widow, the former Hasu H. Gardiner; two sons, Walter and James Gardiner Nichols; a daughter, Mrs. Robert H. Chapman, and a sister, Miss Abby Nichols. James Nichols is cultural attaché at the United States Embassy in Tokyo.

1373-> NEW PARLEY SEEN ON MALAYSIA SOON
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Friday, May 22 (AP)—Diplomatic sources said today that Malaysia and Indonesia appeared very close to agreement on taking their feud to a new peace summit. Speculation was that new tripartite talks among Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines might begin within two weeks in Tokyo or Bangkok. The sources said that Thailand now appeared to be cast in a crucial role because of her reported agreement to act as neutral third party to verify withdrawal of Indonesian guerrillas from Malaysian Borneo. The crisis is an outgrowth of bitter Indonesian opposition to the creation of Malaysia. Diplomats based their optimistic assessment on both press and diplomatic reports from Jakarta and conversations with Malaysian government leaders. Salvador Lopez, former Philippines Foreign Minister, who has been quietly negotiating on the issues, is expected here soon from Jakarta with the latest information on the position of President Sukarno of Indonesia.

1374-> LYKES PROPOSES SHIP AUTOMATION
The Lykes Bros. Steamship Company, operator of the na­tion's second‐largest subsidized fleet; asked the Maritime Com­mission yesterday for permis­sion to spend $4 million that would eventually save the Gov­ernment $37 million in subsidy payments. The New Orleans‐based com­pany requested permission to “automate” 21 of the newest ships in its fleet of approxi­mately 50 freighters. In mak­ing the application, the com­pany introduced a new word into the marine world's lexicon —“retrofit.” Lykes asked the commission Lykes has been one of the companies pressing for installa­tion of shipboard automation that would make United States­flag ships more competitive with foreign‐flag vessels. Over the last year, maritime unions have negotiated contracts with companies holding such objec­tives and yet have kept their members content with other substitute gains. Under the retrofit program, Lykes—if permitted by the Maritime Administration and the General Accounting Office to send its vessels back to the shipyards—could reduce the size of the crews aboard the ships from 45 men to 35, the petition stated. The Lykes request was in the nature of a “feeler,” one execu­tive said. If the Federal agency gives its approval, the com­pany would then negotiate with On the last series of ships built by the company, the steam­ship line has been able to ob­tain almost a 30 per cent re­duction in the size of its crews. Thisreduction has been made possible largely by the installa­tion of an integrated system of main propulsion machinery with centralized engine‐room control. Officers on the bridge can have “fingertip control” of the speed and direction of the ship without the assistance of anyone in the engine room. To achieve the over‐all $37 million in savings on operational subsidies over the remaining life of the vessels, the com­pany asked that the Govern­ment invest between $3.5 and $4.5 millions in construction subsidies to retrofit the vessels with automated devices. The company operates ships from Gulf ports to Europe, Africa and the Far East. .

1378-> Ship Pilots to Test ‘Walkie-Talkie’
A one‐year test of a radiotelephone system that permits instant voice communication between vessels in the New York‐New Jersey harbor will begin tomorrow on ships entering or leaving Port Newark. The system, which will also allow vessel masters to communicate with the Jersey Central Railroad's drawbridge over Newark Bay, is designed to improve navigational safety and reduce ship delays. The test was announced jointly by the Port of New York Authority, the Board of Commissioners of Pilots for New York and New Jersey, and the New York and New Jersey Sandy Hook Pilots Associations. The results of the test on the Port Newark‐based vessels will be used by the Board of Commissioners of Pilots to determine whether the system should be used by pilots on all vessels in the port. During the test period, all Sandy Hook pilots boarding vessels moving to or from Port Newark will be equipped with “walkie‐talkie” sets. This will permit ships on the “party line” to be aware of the location and intentions of nearby vessels. Communication with the Jersey Central drawbridge will help the pilots of vessels approaching the bay from the “blind side” of the Bayonne Peninsula, who cannot see the bridge until they are within 1,000 yards of it.

1379-> SHIRT SHOPS UNIT SOLD BY MRORY; Group of Concerns Acquires Division for $5 Million
The sale of its National Shirt Shops division was completed yesterday by the McCrory Corporation, a diversified retailing complex, controlled by the Rapid‐American Corporation. The sale of the 159 men's furnishing stores was for $5, million in cash and notes. The purchasers were a group of corporations formed specifically to buy the division by Sol Goldmark, president of the Janville Manufacturing Company, and Nick Badami, president of the Fordham‐Bardell Shirt Corporation.

Isidore A. financial vice president and treasurer of McCrory, said: that the escrow money was “a normal amount” held aside until a final balance sheet was prepared by auditors. A McCrory spokesman noted that the sale also provided for the company to retain more than $5 million in cash of National Shirt Shops Corporation. The sale of National Shirt, leaves McCrory with the McCrory McLellan‐Green variety stores division, the Lerner women's stores division and two small variety store divisions in the South. McCrory also owns the Otasco‐Economy automobile supply stores, but these are understood to be up for sale.

1385-> CANOEING ON ‘WHITE WATER’ IN WEST VIRGINIA
PETERSBURG W.Va—Racing in fragile canoes down foaming, rockstudded rapids is cold, wet, dangerous and exhausting labor Yet, to many canoeing enthusiasts, it is the finest sport in the world Such enthusiasts will go hundreds of miles to dip their paddles in “white water”—streams covered with the creamy foam whipped up by the speed and turbulence of the current. And some.Oef the finest white water in the nation is found in the’ West Virginia canoe countrv That is why canoeists from all oter. the East will gather here,°early next month for Petersburg's annual White‐Water Weekend. More than 20 experts will race itgainst time down one of these:iwhite‐water streams, a 14mile Aretch of the North Fork of the Potomac. Other events will be held for less‐advanced canoelsts, and visitors win line the streams to watch and take uictures. Race on Second Day The big race will be held on Saturday, April 4, the second day of the three‐day meet. In the evening, canoeists and touriats Will gather at the centuryold Hermitage Hotel here for sul3p* et.nd a dance. The next afteenoon, on the South Branch c$ the Potomac, experts will demoP.Ft.rate whitewater canoe techniquea for amateurs and visitors. The foer‐mile cruise will begin at the village of Upper Tract and proceed to the Smoke Hole Recreational Area.i. The meet will get under way on Friday evening, April 3, when; Jectures and motion pictures on canoeing and the West Virginia canoe country will be presented at the hotel. The score or so of experts who have been invited tn enter the main event will come from West ’ Virginia and the adjoining states, as well as from New England, New York and New Jersey. They will launch their craft above Hopewell Gap Gorge. There, the North Fork flows swiftly through a narrow valley, falling an average of 32 feet a mile. Entering the gorge, the river increases in speed, and only experts can successfully battle its five‐foot waves and slip between its dangerous rocks. For safety's sake, contestants will wear waterproof suits, crash helmets and lifejackets, and first‐aid stationg will be up along the shore. Four classes will compete: one‐man canoes, two‐man canoes, canoes with a man and a woman, and one‐man kayaks. Placid or Swift The Petersburg area has many excellent canoeing streams. Some are placid enough for the beginner, while others are swift enough to challenge the most expert. Much of the 30‐mile stretch of the South Branch above Petersburg is among the most ex citing. So deep is the gorge through Smoke Hole Canyon that only at noon does sunshine touch the surface of the stream. A road above the canyon provides magnificent views of the river and the surrounding mountains. Another turbulent stretch of water, the Moorefield River, lies i over the mountains east of Smoke Hole. In the spring, it is navigable as far as Fort Seybert. In its upper course, the Moorefield flows swiftly through a narrow canyon. Downstream, the valley widens and the river slows, making a quiet stream for the amateur, canoeist. Still farther down, after joining the South Branch and the North Fork, the river flows through the Trough. This is said to have been named by George Washington, who once canoed there. Towering mountains and strange rock formations line the banks of the Cacapon River from Capon Bridge to Forks of the Cacapon. This 12‐mile stretch of the river is popular with amateur canoeists. Farther north, not far from the Pennsylvania line, is the treacherous Cheat River. This stream, and its tributaries to the south, offer exciting whitewater canoeing through some of West Virginia's most rugged mountains Challenging Course Especially challenging is the Cheat River course from Rowlesburg to a point near Albright. A hard‐surface road that parallels most of this stretch, affords some fine views of the stream. Below Albright, the river races for 11 miles through Cheat Canyon, where the water is so turbulent that only the most skillful can negotiate it. The visitor will find much of interest in the Petersburg area. Especially dramatic is 4,860foot‐high Spruce Knob, the highest point in the state, which offers an excellent view of mountains and forests. It is about 30 miles to the southwest. Smoke Hole Caverns, 15 miles south of Petersburg, are some of the largest caves in the East. Monongahela National Forest Recreational Area is within easy driving distance, as is BIackwater Falls, with its picturesque canyon and surrounding mountains.

WASHINGTON, March 2 (AP)—Nicholas Johnson, 29year‐old lawyer, was sworn in today as administrator of the Federal Maritime Administration. At the ceremony President Johnson described him as the type of young man who will infuse the Government with intelligence and energy. The President told the new maritime administrator that he had set an example for other capable men by leaving a highly profitable law practice to enter Government service. Immediately after the ceremony, the new administrator and Secretary of Commerce Luther H. Hodges, who administered the oath, conferred with the President on the . sale of wheat to the Soviet Union. Pierre Salinger, White House press secretary, said Mr. Hodges and Mr. Johnson had told the President they were hopeful that 50 per cent of a 700,000‐ton sale by Cargill, Inc., could be shipped in United States vessels. He said the 50 per cent arrangement could be reached if Soviet shipping regulations were changed to allow larger American vessels to dock. A United States mission is in Moscow to determine this. Nicholas Johnson succeeds Donald W. Alexander, who resigned, as maritime administrator. Mr. Johnson is a native of Iowa City, Iowa, and attended the University of Texas.

1387-> U.S. RUGBY STARS UPSET CANADIANS; Victory Is Americans' First in International Play
America took a major step forward on the world rugby scene yesterday as an all‐star team from the Eastern United States defeated an Ontario Rugby Union select squad. This marks the first victory for an Eastern all-star squad in international competition. The victory did not come easily as the United States won a hardfought, 3‐0, match at Gaelic Park. A hard rush by the American forwards in the closing minutes of the first half produced The game's only score. Paul Olin, who played an outstanding match, carried the ball over for a three‐point try. The second half was dominated by the American forwards, but in the closing minutes the Canadian side made a spirited effort to even the score. The match ended deep in American territory. Rugby is similar to American football. The players however, are not allowed to wear padding and forward passing and blocking are not permitted. There is no substituting, even for injury, and no time‐outs. It is the national game of many countries and crowds of more than 100,000 are not unusual. The international match was the closing event of the second annual Canadian‐American festival. There were seven games played in New York yesterday, pitting Canadian teams against American squads. The American teams lost only one of the seven matches. The opening game was a rough 8‐8 tie between the Old Blues, one of the outstanding clubs on the East Coast, and the Montreal Barbarians, one of Canada's leading teams. Following this the Manhattan R.C. beat the Ottawa Beavers, 14—0; Old Blues B's beat the Barbarian B's, 14—0; New York R.C. beat Montreal Wanderers, 9—6, and New York R.C. B's lost to the Toronto Nomads, 10—0. More than 500 Canadians came to New York for the seven games. Rugby, being one of the most amateur of sports, all the players paid their own expenses. The Eastern Rugby Union represents the Eastern United States from Pittsburgh to the coast and has grown from 10 teams to 40 in the last five years. Edmund Lee, the president of the E.R.U., predicted that the United States would soon be playing in first class international competition.

1388-> U.S. Reappraising Program for Supersonic Airliner
The White House is making a hard reappraisal of the program for developing a supersonic airliner. The objectives of the review are to strengthen the management of the program and to make the financing more palatable to industry. This reappraisal was touched off by a 105‐page report prepared by Eugene R. Black, former head of the World Bank, who is a director of a dozen corporations, and Stanley deJ. Osborne, investment banker and former airline executive. The White House is expected to come up with changes in the program by mid‐April. Few of the specific recommendations in the Black‐Osborne report will be adopted as written. But the report has served the function of setting in motion what some consider a belated review. Seven Points Stressed The authors themselves arc understood to consider these the main recommendations in the report: 𝑞The program mustgo ahead rapidly but not at a speed that will jeopardize its success. 𝑞It should be directed by a new agency that could make certain that all the nation's resources are harnessed to insure the success of the program. There is no point in building the plane unless fares, routes, airways, traffic control, aviation agreements with foreign nations and even ground transportation are also ready for the supersonic age. 𝑞The Government must pay more of the development cost than the 75 per cent it now plans, because it is impossible for aircraft manufacturers to carry 25 per cent of the estimated $1 billion cost. These public funds must be recovered by the Government if the plane is a success, but it is too early to determine just how. 𝑞Government financing may also be needed to produce the planes if they pass extensive flight tests successfully. Under the present plan, the Government would only guarantee private loans to meet production costs. 𝑞This public help for a commercial airliner should be considered “not on the theory of subsidy but in the whole national interest.” 𝑞No commitments of any kind should be made to produce the plane until after flight testing that would be more extensive than the present plan requires. 𝑞Airlines should not be allowed to reserve deliveries of the planes, as they are now doing through the Government, until flight testing has provided more data on the plane's performance and economics. President Johnson will consider much more than the Black‐Osborne report before ordering changes. Four Cabinet officers and eight other Government executives who helped create the existing program have just completed their own appraisals of the Black‐Osborne recommendations. Several of these men sit as members of the National Aeronautics and Space Council. which President Johnson directed as Vice President and has remained close to as President. When they were formulating the present program, he referred to them as “the Space Council, expanded.” They are Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, Secretary of Commerce Luther H. Hodges: Najeeb E. Halaby, Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency; James E. Webb, Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Alan S. Boyd Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board; Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, and four men from the Presidential staff. The latter are Dr. Walter W. Heller, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; Kermit Gordon, Director of the Budget Bureau; Donald F. Hornig, special assistant for science and technology; and Edward C. Welsh, executive secretary of the Space Council. One of the most controversial Black‐Osborne proposals was to take management of the program away from the Federal Aviation Agency. Government sources say this is not likely to be done. These sources acid, however, that one way to strengthen the management of the program might be to name some or all of the 12 men above as a “board of directors” to advise the aviation agency. This board might also include private citizens, representing aircraft, airline and banking circles. The Black‐Osborne report was requested by President Kennedy last August, even though two years of study has preceded the start of the program in June. The main reason for another study was continued controversy over who would pay for the plane and how. Mr. Black and Mr. Osborne, worked for four months, using no staff. They interviewed many people, including American bankers and aircraft executives and British Cabinet officers. It was the existence of a British‐French program to develop the Concorde supersonic jet that led this country to begin its program when it did. The market for supersonic airliners is estimated at several billions of dollars. Mr. Black and Mr. Osborne handed their report to President Johnson last Dec. 19. Mr. Johnson has not asked them for further comments. The proposal expected to have the most impact is the one calling for more Government financing. Three airframe and three engine manufactuers have entered the first round of the aviation agency's contest to select builders for the plane. All six said they could not finance 25 per cent of a development program that may cost even more than the S1 billion estimate. The companies proposed plans closer to the Black‐Osborne ratio of 90 to 10. Government sources predict that the Federal share will end up higher than 75 per cent, but probably below 90. If the development cost exceeds $1 billion, the manufacturers, under the present plan, will pay the bulk of the excess. Mr. Black and Mr. Osborne insisted, as the existing plan does, that the Government money be recovered eventually. But they opposed the present plan of recovering it in the form of royalties from the airline that buy the planes. If for some reason the plane fails, the Government will have borne most of the cost undereither plan. The President's disclosure that the Lockheed A-11 is already flying at the speeds and altitudes of a supersonic airliner may have been intended partly to dispel doubts about the technical risks involved. Delay Rejected Some of the Black‐Osborne proposals were rejected even before the report was made public this month. One was to postpone the start of the first round of the design contest from last January to next June and to make the first two planes purely test models. The present program provides that two aircraft will be tested but that they can later be refurbished and sold to the airlines. The present plan also permits some preliminary steps toward production to be taken while the flight tests are going on. Mr. Black and Mr. Osborne opposed any commitment to production until the test planes had shown whether the program should be abandoned or whether last‐minute design changes should be made if it was to go ahead. The White House also re jected the authors’ proposal that the Government scrap its system of taking ‘reservations’ from airlines for early deliveries of the plane. The authors believed that. orders should not be taken until more was known about the finished product and that, in any case, accepting reservations was not a governmental function. 75 Planes Reserved This is usually done by the manufacturer. Butsince none has been chosen, the aviation agency has taken over this role. It has already granted four American and eight foreirn carriers reservations for the first 75 planes. It has accepted about 30 of these since the Black‐Osborne report was submitted. Mr. Black and Mr. Osborne. were also concerned, as many. others are, that Congress might, be tempted to abandon the program in later years because of its great cost. They urged that the entire program be sent to Congress for approval. Government sources say the executive branch sees no need for this now. Congress has already approved $91 million for the earliest phases of the program. If the program moves beyond selection of contractors and into expensive development next year, then authorizing legislation will become necessary, these sources say. The British‐French Concorde is expected to fly at 1,450 miles an hour, carry 10-1 passengers and sell for about $10 million a plane. Its range will be about 3,600 miles. Depending on which design is chosen, the American plane will fly 1,700 to 2,000 miles an hour and carry up to 227 passengers. Its range be between 4,000 and 4,500 miles. Its price is roughly estimated at $25 million to $30 million a plane.

1389-> U.S. Stand Believed Weakened At Geneva Trade Conference
WASHINGTON, March 10—The United States is going to a major world trade conference in Geneva later this month with two strikes against it, both inflicted by Congress, according to views expressed today in Administration as well as in some Congressional quarters. The view were expressed in the wake of the Senate's failure last week to act on implementing legislation for the International Coffee Agreement and the House's earlier refusal to raise the United States contribution to the International Development Association. The Geneva meeting, known formally as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and scheduled to open March 23, is expected to develop into a showdown between the industrialized nations and the under‐developed countries, with the Communist bloc heavily favoring the second group. Preliminary regional conferences in the underdeveloped areas, notably in Latin America, have underscored the desire of these countries to win major concessions from the industrialized world, including a complete change In the trading patterns and structures. Preferences Sought A conference in Brasilia last January, organized by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, and last week's meeting at Alta Gracia, Argentina, sponsored by the Inter‐American Economic and Social Council, have indicated the Latin Americans will push for three major objectives. One is the replacement of the 18‐year‐old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by a more flexible and broader world trading organization. The second is the winning of unilateral preferences in world trade, with their necessity attributed to the chronically adverse terms of trade in the underdeveloped nations. The third is the increase of trade with the Communist group. The Soviet Union and other Communist countries support the position of the under-developed countries. Czechoslovakia is the only full-fledged Communist member of GATT. However, it is also recognized that the apparent unity of the under‐developed nations, including the Latin Americas, is probably tenuous and would not survive the whole parley. While the United States, along with the other industrialized countries, opposes the removal of GATT, the United come closer to the position of the under‐developed nations in States has been urging a liberalization of its procedures to their anxieties to improve their trading situation. There are obvious political overtones in the seven‐week Geneva conference, and the United States has been anxious to meet the anticipated attacks from the under‐developed bloc and from the Communists in the strongest possible position. Neither Action Decisive But this is where, officials here say, the United States stand has been weakened by the two Congressional actions, though neither of them is decisive, except in providing arguments to Washington's critics. Although the executive board of the coffee agreement had extended the deadline for implementation of the pact by the consumer countries from April 1 to June 1, the Administration had been anxious to have it approved prior to the Geneva conference. However, much opposition in the Senate to the agreement, largely due to the recent rise in the coffee prices, raised the possibility of several days' debate. Because of the urgency to begin debating the civil rights bill, the Senate leadership reluctantly decided to postpone action on the coffee agreement. As matters now stand, no action is likely for some two months. But passage may be even more difficult later in the year because of the likelihood that coffee retail prices may increase even further, perhaps by 8 cents a pound, to catch up with the level of the wholesale prices.

1390-> Mail Box Fails Post Office Test
The mailbox at the northeast corner of 35th Street and Eighth Avenue was tried for almost a year, but couldn't pass the Post Office Department test. Like eight of its kind here, and several score in other cities, the experimental model with a low pyramidal roof was found to have corners that were too sharp and, like mailboxes of the past, to require frequent painting. But the search for the perfect mailbox will take a new tack this summer, according to a spokesman for the New York Regional Office of the Post Office Department. In August, if the schedule is met, mailboxes of stainless steel will be installed for test purposes. They will have flat tops and will require no painting. The spokesman said that painting costs about $5 a box each year, and that outside of cities it frequently is difficult to find contractors willing to take on the work.

1391-> MacArthur and U.N.; General's Role as the World Body's Commander in Korea Is Discussed
Under any circumstances the death of Douglas MacArthur would have been a memorable event in the history of the United Nations. He was the first commander of the first armed force raised by an international organization to stop an aggression. Under his command United Nations forces fought their way up to the Yalu, only to be driven back into South Korea when Communist China's “volunteers” intervened. President Truman's dismissal of General MacArthur 13 years ago brought to a head the resentment felt by many Americans over the fact that other members of the United Nations opposed the all‐out strategy that the im‐ perious general wanted to use in Korea. Since General MacArthur's death the publication of interviews which he granted after his recall has revived the controversy over his belief that “in war there is no substitute for victory,” and that the United Nations forces should have carried the war into Manchuria to achieve that victory. In 1954, at the time he talked with two of the correspondents, General MacArthur must have been consumed with bitterness over the fact that the long war had ended with an armistice that left the boundary between North and South Korea about where it was when the North Koreans attacked. There is no other explanation for his charge that Britain, in addition to blocking the strategy he wanted to follow, actually passed on his war plans to Communist China. Some of the other statements attributed to General MacArthur also seem open to question. For example, he was quoted as favoring the use of the atomic bomb, although he had denied doing so. In any event, the main lines of the strategy General MacArthur advocated—the use of Chinese Nationalist troops, the bombing of Manchuria and a naval blockade—were already known from the statements that he continued to issue from Tokyo in defiance of Washington. The basic fact in the bitter controversy was that General MacArthur's views ran counter to the policy of the Truman Administration to fight a limited war, like those that were the rule in the 18th century, in the belief that the risks of a fullscale war with Communist China outweighed the possible gains. Concern in Washington over the possibility that the United States might get bogged down in a war on the mainland of Asia was increased by fears that Stalin would take advantage of the situation to attack Western Europe— which was still almost entirely dependent upon the United States for protection, Naturally, these fears were felt even more keenly in Western Europe. In addition, the principal allies of the United States, Britain and France, not only urged the United States to avoid a full‐scale war in Korea but were reluctant to commit their troops because they were already involved with Communist‐supported uprisings in Malaya and Indochina. This left the United States and South Korea to carry most of the burden. Nevertheless, and despite India's warning that Communist China's intervention would result, Western European members supported the United States when the United Nations General Assembly adopted the momentous resolution of Nov. 7, 1950, authorizing General MacArthur to advance into North Korea. At that time United Nations troops were at the 38th parallel, and the war aim fixed by the Security Council in its resolution authorizing the defense of South Korea, “to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area,” had been achieved. The General Assembly substituted the ambitious objective of establishing a unified and democratic Korea. However, Communist China's intervention at the time made it impossible to achieve this aim without the use of the methods advocated by General MacArthur, and the result was the general disillusionment that finally produced the armistice of July, 1953. Since the United States retained its nuclear supremacy over the Soviet Union until 1954 or 1955, some critics have argued that Mr. Truman and Mr. Eisenhower—who rejected the MacArthur strategy whenhe entered the White House—missed a unique opportunity to crush Communist China. Whether or not this verdict is upheld by history, General MacArthur's insubordination toward his Government vastly complicated the relations, which were already difficult, between the United States and the United Nations. After the Chinese Communists' intervention a limited surveillance over operations in the Korean War was exercised, not by any United Nations organ, but by the Rusk Committee, composed of representatives of the 16 member countries which had contributed forces, meeting in Washington under the chairmanship of the present Secretary of State. Since Korea, the United Nations has sent military forces to Egypt, the Congo and Cyprus, not to fight, but to keep order under a settlement reached, or to be reached, under the aegis of the organization. But the same problem that marred the defense of South Korea, that of exercising political control over a military force, has complicated these peace‐keeping action. The General Assembly is too large to be a satisfactory maker of policy, and the Soviet veto makes it hazardous to use the Security Council. The late Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold tried to solve the problem by setting up advisory committees, composed of representatives of members which had supplied troops for the Middle Eastern and Congo forces.His successor, U Thant, has no such committee for the Cyprus force. But he may be compelled to establish one if the situation in Cyprus, which raises political and legal problems of extraordinary complexity, does not improve.

1393-> U.S. SAID TO ACCEPT FORMULA ON PANAMA
WASHINGTON March 9 —The United States was reported tonight to have accepted a new compromise formula for a settlement of its differences with Panama. The text was drafted by a subcommittee of the Organization of American States charge with mediating and investigating the two‐month‐old dispute. Panama has asked for at least two more days to study the formula, which provides for an immediate restoration of diplomatic relations and for “discussions and negotiations” of all outstanding differences, including those concerning the Panama Canal. Sources close to the five‐na‐ tion O.A.S. group said that by accepting the inclusion of the world “negotiotion” the United States had made a major concession to Panama's demands. The United States attitude was described as more conciliatory since President Johnson on Feb. 29 made a qualified offer to consider possible revisions of the 1903 Panama Canal treaty.

This is offered as “proof” that white children would not be safe attending schools in Negro areas. Just one reminder—38 “respectable” white citizens in a “respectable” neighborhood in Queens watched for 35 minutes while an attacker stabbed, several times, Miss Catherine Genovese. Not one of these 38 “respectable” white citizens picked up his telephone to call the police.

1399-> KENNEDY AWARD GOES TO MOTTLEY; Yale Runner Chosen Best Athlete Boston Meet
BOSTON, Jan. 12—The performances and the stature of the winners at the Massachusetts Knights of Columbus indoor track meet last night generally were top rate. There were meet records by John Thomas, John Uelses, Bob Schul and Hayes Jones. There were solid running victories by Tom O'Hara, Bill Crothers, Jay Luck and Sam Perry. There was impressive relay running, especially by Noel Carroll of Villanova. But when the votes were counted for the first winner of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Trophy as the meet's outstanding performer, all these worldclass stars yielded to a Dean's List senior from Yale. His name is Wendell Mottley, he comes from Trinidad and he must rate among the Olympic 400‐meter favorites. Last year he stirred minor sensations in almost every meet with his anchor legs on the Yale mile relay. Last night, in winning by 25 yards, he tied the world record of 55.5 seconds for the 500‐yard run. He would have broken the mark except for a slight detour on the last lap to avoid a pole vaulter leaning over the runway and almost onto the track. Mottley's time came in the East's first major meet of the winter. What's more, it came on a track measuring 11 laps to the mile. The first 0:55.5 clocking was achieved last Feb. 16 by Earl Young on Louisville's 8‐lap banked track, the biggest of all indoor board tracks. “ I'm delighted with my time.” Mottley said today in his soft West Indian accent. “Last year, I tried for a 440‐yard record at the end of the season and got too tight. I was afraid I would run out of meets. Well, I did. Now, it's only January, and I have plenty of time this season for records.” Mottley's next cup appearance will be in the Mel Sheppard 600 at the Millrose Games in Madison Square Garden Jan. 30. Two nights, later the Boston Athletic Association may stage a special quarter‐mile so he can try for Roy Cochran's world indoor record of 0:48.2. That time was recorded in 1942 on the Bronx Coliseum's nine‐lap track. Mottley's 1963 clocking of 0:48.3 is the best ever for any 11‐lap track. Last night, in his 500, he passed 440 yards in 0:48.5. After Mottley is graduated in June, he hopes to continue his economics studies and work for a Ph.D. at Yale or Harvard. At the same time, he will train for the Olympics. The 400 meters is his primary goal at Tokyo. And with Edwin Skinner of Maryland State and Edwin Roberts of North Carolina College, he will form three‐quarters of a contending team in the 1,600‐meter relay. The fourth berth is open. Mottley is 22 years old, stands 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 162 pounds, but appears heavier. He wears glasses. He has a quick smile, ready wit, and respect from his teammates that borders on awe. He has tremendous natural speed. He runs the 500 by running a 440, then holding on for 60 yards more. He quotes Coach Bob Giegengack of Yale as saying that a man who has natural speed should use it above else. He works out at Yale with Jay Luck and sometimes Jim Stack, former Yale stars, and Walter Johnson, the one‐time North Carolina College quartermiler. When college is out they will run as a one‐mile relay team for the newly formed New Haven Track Club. Their best times add up to 3:05.8. Their potential success excites Mottley as much as do his personal achievements. In addition to Mottley's record, the meet marks here were Thomas's 7‐foot 2‐inch high jump, Uelses’ 16‐1½ pole vault and Schul's 13‐minute 31.4‐second three‐mile, the fastest ever indoors by an American citizen. Jones twice tied the meet mark of 0:05.5 for the 45‐yard high hurdles. The other cup winners were O'Hara in the mile (4:06.3), Crothers in the 1,000‐yard run (2:10.7), Luck in the 600 (1:10.5) and Perry in the 50 (0:05.3). Of all the winners, onlyCrothers had a close call. Thomas, Jones, Luck and Crothers repeated 1963 victories.

1402-> Letters to The Times; Jonathan Bingham Backed
TO THE EDITOR: As my home has been in the Bronx for over seventy years, I am naturally interested in good government, high‐grade appointments and efficient planning. I feel strongly, therefore, that the recent disclosure of Charles Buckley's payroll pad‐ding has emphasized on the national scene what those of us in the Bronx have long known well—Mr. Buckley's poor attendance record in Congress, contempt for the office he holds and stunted vision of public service. Now we have a rare opportunity to displace Mr. Buckley by voting in the June 2 primary for Jonathan Bingham. A long‐time resident of the Bronx, a man who has served. the Bronx in countless ways, Mr. Bingham knows intimately the needs of the Bronx. His experience, integrity and excellence in public service have been tested on the international level as a United States Ambassador to the United Nations, on the national level as head of the Point IV aid program and on the state level as secretary to Governor Harriman. Here indeed is the opportunity for every citizen who claims a devotion to good government to support Jonathan Bingham.

1403-> A Modern Crusader
The visit of Pope Paul VI to the Holy Land is a reminder, as Macaulay wrote, that the history of the Roman Catholic Church “joins together the two great ages of human civilization.” The last Roman Pope to be in Jerusalem, it is not fanciful to say, was St. Peter. This is a new kind of Crusade. In the Middle Ages the Roman Popes sent military hordes to conquer the Holy Land from the Islamic “pagans.” The Crusades had much that was bad in them, but they were fired by an exaltation of spirit and an urge to common action and sacrifice in a cause which seemed noble and sacred to generations of Europeans. The effort was a failure, but the inspiration still lives, else Pope Paul would not be going to Jerusalem, as he has said, in the cause of world peace and Christian unity. It is curious that today, as in olden times, the area is rent with racial and religious discord. Jordan and Israel, Moslem and Jew, face each other in enmity where St. Paul wrote hopefully of brotherly love almost exactly nineteen hundred years ago. Pope Paul, from what he has said, is not expecting miracles. He is making a pilgrimage, a gesture that has caught the imagination of the world. There is drama in the vision of a Supreme Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church visiting the Holy Land for the first time in nearly two millennia. What is accomplished will doubtless be in the realm of the spirit. Nothing definitive can be expected in healing the breaches between the Roman and Eastern Orthodox Churches or between Arabs and Jews. Total peace is a long way off. Thoughts, ideas, feelings, hopes will be stirred by the Pontiff's journey. Those for whom history is a perennial fascination will look back at the incredible span of time that has elapsed. In this nuclear age they will be driven to reread that famous passage of Macaulay's on the Roman Catholic Church: “She was great and respected before the Saxon had set foot on Britain, before the Frank had passed the Rhine, when Grecian eloquence still flourished in Antioch when idols were still worshipped in the temple of Mecca. And she may still exist in undiminished vigour when some traveller from New Zealand shall, in the midst of a vast solitude, take his stand on a broken arch of London Bridge to sketch the ruins of St. Paul's.”

1404-> Letters to The Times; Filling the Vice‐Presidency
TO THE EDITOR: Your April 27 editorial “Presidential Disability” seems sound except for your proposal that upon the Chief Executive's death the House of Representatives select a new Vice President from a list of nominees sent up by the new President. In the first place, the selection is not one in which the opposition party should participate. Under your proposal, a large proportion of its membership in the House could be expected to vote for the candidate who would add the least strength to the new President's political prospects. If a new Vice President is to be selected prior to the next convention, the selection should be made by the President with the approval of a simple majority of the House and Senate membership. If the line of succession began in the Cabinet, as you propose and on which I agree, it would not even be necessary to require a new President to appoint a Vice President prior to the next convention. Requiring him to make such a choice soon after beginning to serve out the balance of his predecessor's term (which could be anything up to four years) might cause him and the country political difficulties that outweigh the value of having the vacancy filled soon. It would perhaps be best to permit the new President to name a Vice President with the approval of the Congress, as I suggested, leaving the decision as to both time and nominee to his discretion.

1408-> Letters; ‘NOT CONQUERORS’
To THE EDITOR: After reading Mr. Jacobs's article, I found myself compelled to defend his “conquering generals”—the nurses. There are thousands of professional nurses in this country who, like myself, treat patients as individuals, caring for their physical as well as emotional and spiritual needs. “You’ll have to ask the doctor that” is a common phrase used, not because of stupidity but rather because of professional ethics. There are medical facts that only the doctor can tell the patient. Contrary to Mr. Jacobs, nurses are encouraged to alleviate fears of the unknown (the hospital) by going into detail regarding hospital procedures, especially treatments he may be receiving. The “wake‐up hour” is a policy set by the hospital which Mr. Jacobs's “nurse battalions” must carry out in a quiet, softspoken manner, rather than with the military 𠆜charge” the author feels we professional nurses make upon the sleeping patients. “I had no wish to disgust or upset any other nurse. Her letter, however, implies that nurses are entirely blameless for the frequently ridiculous procedures of hospitals. She reproves administrators and doctors, scolds The Times, and writes me off as lacking understanding. It is precisely such all‐knowing airs of superiority and ‘Superwomanship’ seen in so many nurses that cause so many patients to become disgusted and upset. Which of us sinners could be comfortable in the same room with a genuine angel? Mrs. Keene sounds sharp, and has a point, but displays symptoms of a common nurse ailment ( ‘policy’ addiction, complicated by the ‘ethics’ syndrome), and is suffering, I suspect, from an undernourished sense of humor.”

1410-> Anti‐Castro Exiles Said to Raid Cuba at 2 Points
WASHINGTON, May 15 (AP)—The Washington Eve ning Star reported today that two anti‐Castro Cuban exile organizations landed forces on the northern and southern shores of the island this morning. The report was attributed to unidentified United States Government sources. Havana did not confirm or comment on new landings. United States Government officials said they had no knowledge of any attacks. In Miami the headquarters of two exile organizations declined to confirm or deny the reported landings. The Evening Star said that one group of exiles headed by Manuel Artime. chief of the Revolutionary Recovery Movement, had landed at Palao, on the south coast of Oriente Province. The other, it reported, went in at an undisclosed point on the north coast of the island under the leadership of Manuel Ray, leader of the Revolutionary Junta. The Citizens Committee for a Free Cuba, an exile organization based here, confirmed the landings but gave a somewhat different version. A spokesman for the committee said the landing on the coast was actually carried out early Wednesday at the time exile forces struck a sugar mill at Pilon, in Oriente Province. In fact, the spokesman said, the attack on Pilon was a diversionary move to permit the landing of an infiltration team.

1414-> Letters; FOR THE WEST
TO THE EDITOR: I found Arnold Toynbee's mixed feelings on Western civilization (“Why I Dislike Western Civilization,” May 10) rather querulous oversimplification and an unhelpful approach to the problem of “How to Stay Sane Though Westernized.” It should be apparent by now that given a choice between Western technology and the alternatives, the peoples of our world, East, West, North or South, will plunk for flush toilets and smallpox vaccinations every time. Even Mr. Toynbee would find the alternative to the former “annoying,” and to the latter “fright‑ It seems silly to bemoan travel by jet and to glorify sightseeing on foot when one still has the choice to do either. Today's Western music can be displeasing and unsettling, but we aren’t forced to listen to it We have the opportunity to choose among the music of many different periods and from a variety of cultures. I do not feel that Western man is any more cruel or depraved than any other man in time or space; we have our percentage of brutes, as we do of compassionate people.

1416-> Kennedy Cadence
CHICAGO, Jan. 26—“Itaque concives mei Americani, ne rogetis quid patria vestra pro vobis facere possit, immo quid vos pro patria facere possitis, id rogate.” That is what President Kennedy's Inaugural Day admonition, “And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country,” would have sounded like if he had been an ancient Roman. Scholars at Loyola Uiversity here said President Kennedy's English style matched well the Latin cadence of Marcus Tullius Cicero. The university is preserving the words of the Inaugural Address in Latin in a pamphlet in which the English version and the Latin translation appear side by side. The Rev. John C. Malloy, S.J., Dean of Admissions, said copies had been distributed to high schools and colleges and would be available from the Dean of Admissions office, 820 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago 60611. Father Malloy mailed a copy to John F. Kennedy Jr. with a note saying: “In years to come, historians and political scientists as well as other students of public affairs will study your late father's famous Inaugural Address.”

1417-> A mos W.W. Woodcock Is Dead; Headed Prohibition Enforcement; Former Army Officer and College President Fought Losing Battle as a Dry
SALISBURY, Md., Jan. 17 (AP)—Brig. Gen. Amos W. W. Woodcock, an Army officer in both world wars, a former college president and director of the Bureau of Prohibition, died at his home today. He was 80 years old and had been a bachelor. Amos Walter Wright Woodcock once observed that it was his service as chief enforcer of Prohibition, unsuccessful as it was, for which he was destined to be remembered. “My reputation as a Dry seemed to eclipse everything else I did,” he said sadly. Looking back on those frustrating years when he wielded an inadequate broom against a tide of lawbreaking that had full public support and official, if covert, sanction, General Woodcock wrote in 1933: “Not only was public opinion decidedly against the 18th Amendment, but we had to combat politics and legal delays, and from the courts to a secretary's office in the White House we ran against tantalizing interference with our work.” General Woodcock's appointment as director of the Prohibition Bureau in 1930 by President Herbert Hoover was generally applauded by supporters of the 18th Amendment. General Woodcock announced immediately that enforcement of the amendment would be carried out with careful regard for the Bill of Rights. He said he would treat accused offender with “fairness and lawfulness” and assembled a staff to work in cooperation with the Treasury Department and state and local police authorities. The first complaints made against enforcement were that the agents under General Woodcock were being too vigorous, if not violent in their zeal to stop the flow of illegal liquor from source to supplier to consumer. General Woodcock announced a plan of steady pressure, hoping that enforcement and education of the public would bring about the abolition of liquor consumption in the nation. Within a short time, however, the General faced mounting problems of agents amenable to bribe, collusion between police and bootleggers, cluttered court calendars and vast public hostility. He was derided by opponents of the Volstead Act and criticized by his Dry supporters for not achieving promised results. Editorial writers said, “After more than 10 years of Prohibition the Government has to admit the blunders and misconduct of agents and investigators and of the rights of citizens, the hand too quick on the trigger, the hot head wanting judgment.” In the meantime, organized gangs had raised violation of Prohibition to the status of big business, killing off competitors ingang wars and exacting tribute from thirsty citizens. General Woodcock's agents staged raids, dumped illicit whisky into sewers, razed moonshine stills, confiscated trucks and warehouses, issued summonses, discharged dishonest aides and railed at acquisitive police and lenient judges for three frustrating years. With a new Democratic Wet Administration under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in 1933, however, the Congress and the States repealed the Prohibition Act and his futile battle was over. General Woodcock was born in Salisbury in Oct. 29, 1883. He received a bachelor of arts degree in 1903 from St. John's College, Annapolis, a bachelor of laws from the University of Maryland in 1910, and a Master of Arts from Harvard University two years later. General Woodcock began his law practice in his home town in 1912, and joined the law firm of Woodcock and Webb in 1914. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the Army at the outbreak of World War I and served with the American Expeditionary Forces in France, earning a citation for valor in the battle for Verdun. Returning from the war, he became assistant attorney general of Maryland from 1920 to 1922 and United States Attorney for the Maryland district from 1922 until he left to join the Prohibition enforcement service in 1930. Later he was a special assistant to the Attorney General in Washington and in 1934 accepted the presidency of St. John's College, his alma mater. General Woodcock returned to active military service in 1941, and after filling a number of posts was assigned to the Allied prosecution staff for the trials of Japanese war criminals after Japan's surrender. He retired from military service in 1947. He was the author of several books, including “To Hong Kong and Return” and “Golden Days.”

1422-> CARGO PANEL GETS FIRST GRIEVANCE; Panel Meets Wednesday to Hear Italian Complaint
The top‐level grievance committee on cargo preference administration — composed of high‐ranking Government and maritime industry and labor representatives — will hold its first meeting in Washington on Wednesday, it was announced yesterday by Nicholas Johnson, maritime administrator. The committee was set up to hear complaints on problems in shipping cargoes subject to cargo preference under laws that set aside half of such cargoes for American ships. The meeting, Mr. Johnson said, will be a closed one and will be devoted primarily to organizational matters. However, the first grievance submitted for consideration will be taken up. This, he said, is a request by the Italian Government for a waiver of statutory provisions to allow more than half of a shipment obtained under Export‐Import Bank financing to travel in foreign‐flag ships. U.S. Association Protests Opposition to an application by the Italian Government for permission to ship all of $50 million worth of Export‐Import Bank‐financed cargoes in foreign‐flag vessels was voiced by the American Maritime Association last week. The shipments involve some coal, scrap steel and nonferrous metai. In a letter to Mr. Johnson, Ray R. Murdock, the trade association's legislative director, noted that the Government's present waiver policy on shipments financed byGovernmentlending institutions constituted a violation of law. Mr. Murdock charged that the Maritime Administration had misinterpreted the law and that the agency's policy of gen e l waivers permission to ship half of such cargoes in vessels of the recipient nation violated a 1034 statute requiring the use of American‐flag ships to carry all such cargo if United States‐flag vessels are available for the service. Waiver Policy Cited Mr. Murdock recalled that recipient nations were. no longer “war devastated” and that other conditions that gave rise to the general waiver policy no longer existed. He said that even under the general waiver policy adopted in 1945, waiver should not be granted unless American vessels were carrying abouthalf ofthe trade with the recipient nation. “Since American ships carry less than 50 per cent of our foreign commerce on practically all trade routes, the general waiver policy is completely unjustified,” he said.

1426-> CEREMONY ON TV
WASHINGTON; Feb. 26 —President Johnson signed the tax‐reduction bill tonight. He said that it would “strengthen our country and bring a better life to our citizens.”  18. The Senate completed Con­gressional action on the meas­ure at 12:30 P.M. and the Presi­dent signed it at a White House ceremony six hours later. In his remarks on televisionn and radio explaining the impor­tance of the new law, Mr. John­son said: “No one can bury us or bluff us or beat us so long as our economy remains strong.” He called the tax cut “the single most important step that we have taken to strengthen our economy since World War II.” The measure, carrying out the keystone of the economic pol­icy of both the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, pro­vides $11.5 billion in annual tax relief for individuals and cor­porations. The reduction, largest in the country's history, will take ef­fect in two steps. About two­thirds of it applies to income received this year. It will apply in full to income received in subsequent years. For individuals, the average cut will be 19 per cent. For cor­porations, it will be about 9 per cent. The bill does not affect in­come for 1963, on which final returns are due April 15. However, some taxpayers and the economy will begin feeling the effects next week, when withholding of income taxes from wages and salaries is re­duced. The present withholding rate of 18 per cent will be replaced by a 14 per cent rate to corre­spond roughly with the lower final tax liabilities under the bill. This cut applies to all pay‐ The Administration is rely­ing on the resulting increase of $800 million a month in take­home pay to give the economy a big push toward goals set by Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson emphasized these goals in his brief television talk following the signing cere­mony in the East Room of the White House. High among them are rises in consumer demand and business investment to stimu­late increased employment and production, promote sustained growth of the economy and avert recessions. Without alluding to the polit­ical implications of tax re­duuction in a Presidential year, Mr. Johnson also stressed the direct benefits that the bill promises for the country's tax­payers, particularly those with low incomes. "The legislation,” he noted, “was inspired and proposed by our late beloved President Ken­nedy — and passed this week with support of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.” The President used a Tele­prompter for the first time since he became President. The device enables a speaker to read his text from an enlarged image on the television camera. However, Mr. Johnson depart­ed from the prepared text sev­eral times. The signing ceremony was at­tended by Congressional leaders and other key legislators, bus­iness and labor leaders who worked for its passage and Ad­ministration officials. The cere­mony took place 13 months and 2 days after Mr. Kennedy had urged Congress in a special message to cut taxes and make various structural reforms in the Revenue Code. The final bill conforms to the outline of the original proposals but it is vastly dif­ferent in many details. Some of the proposed reforms were re­jected by Congress and others were greatly modified. In ad­dition, the rate reductions orig­inally proposed were scaled down, at the Administration's request, to compensate for the omission or modification of rev­enue‐raising reforms originally recommended. Today's Senate action was on a compromise text of versions passed by the House on Sept. 25 and by the Senate on Feb. 7. The vote today was 74 to 19. On this ballot, which sent the bill to the White House, 53 Democrats and 21 Republicans voted “aye.” The opposition con­sisted of 10 Democrats and 9 Republicans. The House had approved the compromise yesterdy by a simi­larly one‐sided vote of 326 to 83. Most of the opponents on the final Senate vote were conserv­ative Southern Democrats and Republicans. However, they in­luded one Southern liberal, Sen­ator Albert Gore, Democrat of Tennnessee, who had fought the bill vigorously from the time that it reached the Senate Fi­nance Committee last Septem­ber. Also maintaining his opposi­tion to the end was Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, the conservative Democratic chair­man of the Finance Committee. President Johnson neverthe­less singled out Senator Byrd among several others for par­ticular praise in his talk to­night. He said the Virginian, though opposed to the bill, “co­operated to the fullest extent” to give it a fair hearing and assure the Senate an opportu­nity to vote on it.

1427-> Message From Lincoln Sold Here for $16,000
A message of comfort and praise from President Abra­ham Lincoln to the survivors of the badly beaten Army of the Potomac in the Battle of Fredericksburg was auctioned yesterday for $16,000. The document, in Lincoln's hand, was purchased by the Carnegie Book Shop here at a sale of historical, literary and musical manuscripts and letters. The sale, at the Parke‐Bernet Galleries, Madison Avenue, realized $72,160. Lincoln's message, which, with minor changes, was dis­tributed to the army in a printed leaflet, was written on Dec. 22, 1862, nine days after the battle in which the Union forces under Gen. Am­brose E. Burnside, lost 12,­650 men. .

1428-> Homes Adding Dry‐Heat Baths As Interest in Saunas Increases
THE road to international understanding may well pass through a sauna. A list of recent converts, including Premier Khrushchev and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, suggests that Communists and capitalists alike are seeking to reduce their tensions in homestyle Finnish hot baths. Saunas, which may be more or less effectual in reducing human ills than aspirin, represent a burgeoning market in the United States today. The estimated 10,000 home saunas now in use (not counting the woodfired versions that Finns build in their own backyards) are expected to increase to 40,000 by 1970, according to a spokesman for General Electric. The company, which will have sauna stoves coming off the production line in one month, considers the projection “conservative.” The Finnish word sauna, which has been incorporated into French, German and English, means the structural unit where Hinns go to relax and bathe. It may be a small house, an addition to a house or a complex of rooms within an existing building. It includes the hot room where bathers sit or lie on benches to absorb intense dry heat ranging from 200 to 250 degrees or more, the washing area where they shower or the and the recovery room where they relax and wait until their bodies cool down before going out of doors. “The sauna is as sacred to the Finns as the tea ceremony is to the Japanese,” noted Reino Aarnio, Finnish‐born American architect who recently expressed deep concern over what he considers the commercialism of saunas here. “A man must be your friend before you invite him to your sauna,” he said. —Echoing Mr. Aarnio's distress arethose purists who decry recent announcements of metal, ceramic‐tile and plastic‐surfaced saunas. The theory they subscribe to, which is rooted in the ancient traditions of Finland, is that the building or room must have wooden walls, floor and ceiling. Those seeking to preserve the Finnish ritual intact have no quarrel with the type of fuel used to fire the stove of the sauna (electricity, wood, gas and oil versions are made), but thy do object to stoves that fall short of the 200‐degree minimum. According to one sauna conern, a major stumbling block or American producers is the act that Underwriters Laborories, Inc., will approve only stoves with a maximum temperature of 194 degrees. Importers such as Cecil Ellis Sauna, Inc., 18 West 58th Street, which offers a Finnish stove, and Viking Sauna, 310 Madison Avenue, purveyors of a Swedish unit, note that theirs reach temperatures of 240 degrees. A Finnish stove costs $525, a Swedish version $675, and G.E.'s wall unit, $700. The state of euphoria that Americans are seeking in their private purchases of complete saunas commands luxury prices. Prefabricated units cost from $1,695 at Viking and from $1,825 at Cecil Ellis. Viking, the giant of the industry, which has its home base in San Francisco, expects to sell between 2,500 and 3,000 saunas this year. Cecil Ellis sees sales of 1,500 hot haths by December. Viking, which has sold units do many entertainers, reports atlat California installations represent well over half of all in use today. The Viking unit, which ranges in size from a ‐by‐6‐foot unit upward, is made red cedar and exudes a rich roma when heated. Built like a g cabin without nails, this una hot room has walls three inches thick and comes with a neater, benches and a rug. Intallation costs from $200. The Ellis sauna is constructed of redwood panels inside and out that sandwich insulation and reflector surfaces so that, is asserted, the heat generated the room is returned to the room. Ellis, which also has sold saunas over the years to many persons in the entertainment and business fields, includes the benches, heater, and birch branches (used for flagellation). For an extra charge of $7.50, this concern also provides a wooden bucket and ladle for splashing water on the sauna stones. Installation costs from $425. Popularization of the home sauna has been credited to several developments. The growing number of commercial saunas and installations in hotels, motels and apartment houses such as Riverview East, 75 East End Avenue, exposes the public to the bath. Private clubs have also spurred interest. Not to be discounted is the film, “To Bed or Not to Bed,” which showed Americans how the Scandinavians emerge steaming from their hot rooms to plunge stark naked into the snow. Visitors to the World's Fair will view a unit at the House of Good Taste.

1429-> Supermarket Employes In Jersey Ratify Contract
NEWARK, April 4—A contract between First National Supermarkets and Local 1262 of the Retail Store Employes Union was ratified here today in balloting at the Military Park Hotel. About 600 workers will return to their jobs in 35 northern New Jersey stores on Monday. The workers had been striking since Dec. 12, and six of the supermarkets were closed during the strike. A union spokesman said the new contract, agreed upon three days ago, was for three years. He said that under the contract a full‐time employe who had been laid off could return to work on an hourly basis, up to 40 hours weekly, in place of part‐time employes. This union demand had been a prime strike issue. The contract also calls for pay increases of $5 to $12.

1430-> Southwest Soundings; Strength of Johnson and Goldwater In This Area Is Assessed
WASHINGTON, March 28—In the states of Arizona and Texas, where this department was sampling the climate during the last fortnight, two names dominated all discussions of national politics—those of President Johnson and Senator Barry Goldwater. If the write‐in plurality for Ambassador Lodge over Goldwater in the Republican primary in New Hampshire, and the narrowness of the Senator's margin over Governor Rockefeller, weakened the resolve of Goldwater's supporters elsewhere to make a last‐ditch fight for his nomination at the San Francisco convention, it was not discernible in the vast territorialsegment of the Southwest. And the fundamental change in the Presidential prospect of 1964 created by the assassination of John F. Kennedy was manifested by the virtual unanimity of the expressed opinion that Mr. Johnson will carry Texas by a large majority. This latter concession is especially significant for several reasons. In 1960, though Mr. Johnson was the Democratic nominee for Vice President and the most intense pressures were applied in his behalf in his home state, the vote for the Democratic national ticket exceeded that cast for the Republican by only 46,233 votes; and the overall party majority in a total of 2,311,845 was reduced to 24,019 by reason of the fact that 22,214 votes were cast for minor candidates. Moreover, while Mr. Johnson endorsed the sweeping equal rights plank of the 1960 Democratic platform, there is a great difference between the endorsement of legislation by a candidate for Vice President and its championship in an even more sweeping form by the occupant of the White House. Finally, among those agreeing that the President will easily win Texas in November were Democrats and Republicans with whom he was and remains highly unpopular. But the tenacity and enthusiasm for Goldwater among the Republicans and ultra‐conservative Democrats encountered in Arizona and Texas was also an impressive discovery for a pilgrim from the now irresolute Republican territory of the East. That the native Goldwaterites (as distinguished from the rich winter immigrants) are at all aware of a possible decline in his prospects since the tragic event at Dallas last November is detectible only in two of their expressions. One is use of the adverb saying “I still believe he will be nominated and elected.” The other is in the frequent expansion of that prophecy: “If he isn t nominated, Goldwater will decide who will be, and lead a clear and effective Republican opposition party if President Johnson is elected.” All these predictions are subject to the results in Illinois, California, Oregon, Wisconsin and the few other states where promising candidacies have been shattered and declining fortunes repaired. And it well may be, as reporters from the East on safari in the hinterland are now chronicling, that Goldwater s original high hopes are on the wane. But not visibly in Texas. And not, of course, in Arizona. This department s travels failed to coincide with Goldwater s. But intimates in Arizona describe him as undaunted in his determination to make it a finish fight at San Francisco and confident he will emerge as the victor. He was disappointed, they said, that some of the prosperous citizens whose promises of unabated financial support had played an important part in overcoming his disinclination to make the race for the nomination began to renege when tragedy elevated Mr. Johnson to the leadership of the Democratic ticket in 1964. But, according to these intimates, the Senator has shrugged off this experience as a common operation of human nature in politics, and—in this instance—with merely “fringe” effects. However, if the very superficial soundings of this department in Arizona be true—that there will be virtually no contest should the event at San Francisco shift Goldwater to a candidacy for re‐election to the Senate—even a superficial survey shows blood already on the political moon within the state Texas. Because of efforts widely credited to President Johnson, Sen. Ralph Yarbor ough is assured of the Democratic renomination without the infliction of any serious party wound, since Representatives Wright and Kilgore have been “induced” not to oppose him. But this tranquility does not extend to the sharp contest for the Democratic nomination for Governor. There the incumbent, John Connally, President Johnson's friend who was wounded at Dallas in the fusilade that ended the life of President Kennedy, is hotly opposed by Don Yarborough. And party blood is already flowing in that battle. For the Senstor of the same name, but no relation, his com- fortable situation will end when the Republicans have made their choice of his opponent. Then, since the Republicans are expected to unite after deciding whether this shall be Jack Cox, George Bush or Robert Morris, the depth and endurance of the ancient split between the Democratic liberals and conserva- tives will again be tested, and the conscquences eould be painful for the party. Cox polled 600,000 votes in his race for Governor against Connally—a political miracle. An idea of his potency in a contest with Ra1ph Yarborough can be gathered from an observation repeatedly made to this department: “If President Johnson were not at the head of the Democratic ticket, Cox would probably be elected by a combination of the Republicans and the Democratio conservatives.” One did not hear as positive a forecast in the event the Renublicans nominate Cox's principal competitor, Bush, de- spite the fact that Bush is en- dowed with remarkable gifts of personality and character, and had a notable record in the Second World War. But the impression of a passing traveler is that the Texas Democrats will require all the skills of Lyndon Johnson's politcal surgery after their two contests have been decided: the primary battle between Don Yarborough and Governor Connally, and the Sen- atorial race between Ralph Yarborough and his Republican opponent. But the elimination of all strong contenders for Senator Yarborough's seat saved the party in Texas from what could, have been its most damaging internal conflict. Also, it pleased the national “liberal” wing of the Democratic party, including the leaders of union labor. For, as President Johnson is supposed to have explained to one of the Senator's frustrated rivals, Ralph Yarborough supports him on equal rights, medicare and tax reduction—all of which the other voted against in the Honse.

1432-> Home Praises Atom Cutback as Britain Joins Move
LONDON, April 21 — The Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas‐Home, associated Britain today with the over‐all actions of the United States and the Soviet Union on reducing the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons. The actions were announced yesterday by President Johnson and Premier Khrushchev. Terming the moves “very pertinent and significant,” Sir Alec told the House of Commons that Britain's production of military plutonium “is being gradually terminated.” Britain, Sir Alec added, has adjusted her supplies of fissionable material “to the minimum necessary to maintain our independent nuclear deterrent and to meet all our defense requirements for the foreseeable future ” Referring to a 1962 agreement to exchange plutonium for American enriched uranium, Sir Alec said none of the plutonium produced by British atomicpower reactors would be used for military purposes by Britain or the United States. “Thus, by the policies which we have adopted and are continuing to pursue,” he added, “the United Kingdom is contributing fully to the initiative that President Johnson and Mr. Khrushchev are taking.” Sir Alec agreed with Harold Wilson, leader of the Opposition Labor party, that the agreement to reduce the production of fissionable material was not actually a measure of disarm ament. “Most of us will feel that it is nevertheless a welcome psychological step on the road to peace,” Mr. Wilson said. Sir Alec added the thought that yesterday's annnouncements from Moscow and Wash‐ ington would “foster that confidence which is essential to build on the achievement” of last year's partial nuclear testban treaty. That agreement, signed in Moscow, banned all but underground nuclear testing. To cheers from the Conservative benches, the Prime Minister told a Labor party questioner that Britian had participated in the negotiations leading to the parallel action by the Soviet Union and the United States. The question and the answer have political significance in an election year. Since he became the Conservatives' leader last October, Sir Alec has sought to make the maintenance of an independent British nu‐ clear deterrent a major election issue. He has argued, to considerable skepticism, on Labor's part, that Britain's nuclear role gave her a special place in the counsels of the two nuclear giants. “We were in the closest consultation with the United States,” Sir Alec told the Commons. He said he had sent a message to Mr. Khrushchev “quite lately,” telling him of the great importance Britain attached to the three‐nation action. Sir Alec told Jo Grimond, leader of the Liberal party, that no international inspection was needed in the move to reduce nuclear‐material production, though inspection remained necessary “over the wider field of disarmament.” “There is clearly a mutual here,” the Prime Minister said. “It suits both the Russians and the Americans,” he said, adding: “It suits everybody. so nobody is tempted to break it ” “We want to reduce inspection to an absolute minimum,” Sir Alec said. He did not answer directly Mr. Grimond's suggestion that the “better atmosphere” generated by the current measures might make it worthwhile to advance proposals to include inspection. The Prime Minister assured other questioners that Britain's planned acquisition of Polarisfiring sumbarines would not stand in the way of President Johnson's proppsal to “freeze” long‐range nuclear‐weapon delivery systems.

1433-> Greek Cypriotes Welcome Support by Sen. Keating
NICOSIA, Cyprus, Feb. 29 (UPI)—Greek Cypriote sources said today that they welcomed a statement by Senator Kenneth B. Keating, in which the New York Republican criticized aspects of United States policy on this strife‐torn island. The statement, published in the Government's Official Bulletin, said: “I share your deep concern for the future of self‐determination and majority rule on Cyprus. I've contacted the State Department several times protesting aspects of United States policy on Cyprus. “I am still pressing publicly and privately for clear U.S. recognition of the rights of the majority on Cyprus and U.S. opposition to outside interference by any nation except with the consent of the Greek Cypriote Government.”

1435-> Southern Feelings Run High on Fried Chicken; Dish Is a Favorite but Methods of Cooking Vary
If there is a single dish over which Southerners in New York, London or Paris seem united, it is fried chicken. Some of them may not have been below the Mason‐Dixon line for 20 years or longer. They may be expatriated, disenfranchised or just plain reconstructed. But fried chicken is a subject about which anyone born in the corn pone region an hold forth with a drawl that lengthens as the talk progresses. When ex‐residents of Dixie gather to talk about fried chicken, it is not to say that All the talk is in accord. Far from it. The fact is that there are rarely two, Southerners who agree on how to fry chicken. Consider the cooking fat, for example. The real Confederate McCoy fat for frying chicken is lard, pure and unadulterated with any fancy fats. As a concession, however, the average displaced Southerner, wherever he may currently reside, will use part lard and part butter or a vegetable oil or, better still in many minds, Crisco. For some reason Crisco sounds like fried chicken. Olive oil is out of the question. People who put on airs are apt to say they use all butter, but they have probably been away from hush puppy country too long for purposes of the present discussion. John Shinn, who was reared in Sylacauga, Talladega County, Ala., has given some serious eonsideration to the dish that was and is one of his favorites. This gentleman, who is now assistant to the president of William Morrow & Co., New York publishers, has made a lifetime study of chicken‐frying techniques, and some of his conclusions follow. “As to the cooking vessel,” he notes, “there is only one: a heavy black iron skillet with low rim, well seasoned and carefully tended. “I trust the summer tenants of my beach house with the best silver and china, but the iron skillets (some of which are more than 100 years old and one of which was hidden under the smokehouse during the Civil War) are hidden against the ravages of steel wool and scouring powder. “A lid is necessary, but any material will do for this, so long as it makes a snug cover. One might do with a very heavy aluminum pan of the same general dimensions, but copperclad, stainless and similar thinner vessels are simply out of the question.” He adds that a fine grade of pure lard is the traditional cooking fat for fried chicken in the South and it is the best choice. “But,” he concedes, “vegeable or peanut oil will do a serviceable job.” Mrs. Availelle Day, a woman of notable imagination who is director of home economics for Bernard L. Lewis, Inc., a public relations concern that specializes in food, agrees for the most part with Mr. Shinn. Mrs. Day, who spent her childhood in Rome, Ga., adds that good fried chicken should be sufficiently salted and have enough black pepper to give it good flavor. She uses one teaspoon of ground pepper for each chicken when cooking for her family. Southern‐fried chicken is almost invariably served with rice or whipped potatoes and cream gravy. There are varying opinions on the gravy. “The gravy should be light brown, free of lumps and well flecked with the browned crumbs scraped from the bottom of the pan,” according to Mrs. Day. “A sophisticated New York cook,” Mr. Shinn says, “tasting a spoonful of the gravy in my kitchen, complained that it tasted of burnt flour and boiled milk. It does because it is. However, no Southern cook ever tried to eat the gravy plain. It must be over something but never over the chicken itself, which must remain in its crisp state, seemly to be eaten out of hand.” Recipes for Southern‐fried chicken and cream gravy from Mr. Shinn and Mrs. Day are listed below. There is also a recipe for Mrs. Frank Norfleet's fried chicken as it appears in “The Memphis Cook Book” (The Junior League of Memphis, Inc.). JOHN SHINN's SOUTHERNFRIED CHICKEN 1     1 ½  1. Wash the chicken pieces under cold running water. Drain, but do not dry. Sprinkle liberally on both sides with salt. 2. Place the flour, pepper and one teaspoon salt in a mediumsize brown paper bag. Add chicken, close top of bag and shake so all pieces are coated evenly and well. Remove chicken pieces and shake to remove excess flour. 3. Place melted shortening or lard or vegetable oil one‐quarterinch deep in a 10‐inch skillet. Place over highest heat for a few minutes until fat is crackling hot. 4. Carefully place chicken pieces in skillet side by side, fleshy side down. Cook rapidly a few minutes, making sure pieces have a firm but very light brown crust on the bottom side. Turn each piece as it reaches this stage, until all are turned. Continue cooking one minute over high heat. Then reduce heat to quite low and cover skillet. Cook 40 minutes. 5. Remove cover and turn heat up once more to highest level. Turn each piece as the bottom becomes golden, but not too brown, and quite crisp. (The top surface of the chicken pieces will have a rather soft, dispirited look when the cover is removed, but a couple minutes turned over will change this to the desired golden crispness.) 6. Remove pieces to drain on paper towels. Yield: Four to six servings. JOHN SHINN's CHICKEN CREAM GRAVY Pour the cooking fat left in the skillet after frying chicken through a sieve. Return two or three tablespoons of the fat to the skillet, along with the brown particles remaining in the sieve. Turn the heat to high, add three tablespoons flour and stir, picking up browned bits remaining in the skillet, until flour is medium brown, then turn heat off. Add a generous sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper and two dashes of Tabasco sauce. Pour in two cups milk all at once, turn heat to medium high and stir constantly until gravy thickens. The consistency should be similar to that of heavy cream. Yield: Two cups. AVANELLE DAY's SOUTHERN‐FRIED CHICKEN 1    ¾  2½   1½ 1. Wash the chicken pieces under cold running water. Drain, but do not dry. 2. Place the three ‐ quarters cup flour, the salt‐and pepper in a medium‐size brown paper bag. Add a few pieces of chicken at a time, close top of bag and shake so pieces are coated evenly and well. 3. Place melted shortening one‐quarter‐inch deep in a 10inch or 11‐inch skillet. Add the chicken to the hot fat and cook over moderate heat until tender, 30 to 40 minutes, turning to brown on both sides. Add additional fat, if necessary. 4. Transfer chicken to a platter and keep warm. Blend the remaining flour with the pan drippings. Cook, stirring, one or two minutes to brown the flour. Scrape the bottom of the skillet to loosen brown particles. Add the milk. Cook, stirring, two or three minutes, or until gravy is medium thick. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve with chicken and hot biscuits Yield: Four to six servings. MRS. FRANK NORFLEET's SOUTHERN‐FRIED CHICKEN 1  1   ¾    1. Wash the chicken pieces under cold running water. Drain, and dry with paper towels. 2. Beat the egg and add lemon juice. Soak the chicken in milk to cover, to which the egg mixture has been added, at least one‐half hour, longer if possible. 3. Place the flour, salt and pepper in a medium‐size brown paper bag. Add the chicken pieces, close top of bag and shake so all pieces are coated evenly and well. 4. Place melted shortening one inch deep in a 10‐inch or 11‐inch skillet. Fry the chicken in it until tender, about 30 to 40 minutes. Serve with gravy and hot biscuits. Yield: Four to six servings.

1436-> President Opposes Easing Rights Bill
WASHINGTON, Feb. 29 —President Johnson said today that he was fully committed to the civil rights bill as it passed the House of Representatives, and that he hoped it would clear the Senate without amendment. Reports that he was willing to compromise on the controversial public accommodations sections of the measure, he said at his news conference, were “strictly Republican in origin.” [Question 16, Page 44.] Mr. Johnson also announced that he had chosen Mrs. Frankie Muse Freeman, a former assistant attorney general of Missouri, as the first woman member of the Federal Civil Rights Commission. [Opening statement.] Mrs. Freeman, who is as‐ sociate general counsel of theSt. Louis Housing and Land Clearance Committee, is alsothe fourth Negro to serve on the commission. In other statements that affected domestic affairs, Mr. Johnson took the following positions: He refused to confirm or deny reports that special seeu rity precautions were taken for him in Florida on Thursday because of reports that a suicide pilot would try to ram his plane. [Question 1.] He declined to speculate on what effect the Senate investigation of Robert G. Baker's business affairs might have in the political campaign. [Question 2.] He would not say whether he would debate his Republican opponent in the campaign, and he would not indicate whom he thought that opponent would be. [Questions 10 and 12.] He pledged to do everything he could to give the people the information they needed to make intelligent political judgments. [Question 15.] He said he had “seen nothing” done by Henry Caboe Lodge, the Ambassador to Souti Vietnam, “ that's in any way in terfered with his work our there,” despite domestic political plans “that some of him friends may have for him.” [Question 5.]  In his comments on the civil rights bill, Mr. Johnson passedup an opportunity to point tosections of the measure on which he might compromise. He is in favor, he said, of the measure “passing the Sen ate exactly in its present form'' He realizes he continued, that “there will be some Senators who will want to strangthen it some who will want to weake it, but so far as this Administration is concerned its position is firm, and we stand on the House bill.” The public accommodations section of the rights bill is itsmost hotly contested provision It would outlaw discrimination against Negroes in restaurants hotels and other places of publ accommodation. Charges have been made the Mr. Johnson would be willing to have this part of the bill watered down to get the meas ure passed. Others have suggested that its softening was part of a “deal” involving also the passage of the Administra tion's tax legislation. In private conversations, the President has emphasized that he considers passage of the pu lic accommodations section vital to the bill. It is on that section he believes, that the Negr community has based most of its hopes for a quick step for ward in the civil rights cam paign. Thus, Mr. Johnson does not consider it politically feasible to compromise on public accommodations, even if he were incined to do so. On the report that the Secret Service had been protecting him from a suicide plane Thurs day, Mr. Johnson conceded only tht there had been "reasons fortaking additional precautions Asked if he planned to follow the “fireside chat tradition.” Mr. Johnson said he considereit “important for the people to know the problems that com front” the President. “A man's judgment on any given question is no better than the facts he has on that ques tion,” he said, “so I go along with the view expressed by jef ferson that the collective judgmentof the many is much to preferred to the selective cisions of the few.” So, he said, he planned to have his news secretary, Pier Salinger, meet the press twio daily, he would see individua reporters himself, “and I may see some of my old‐time friend socially, occasionally, and hope without too much criti cism.” In addition, he said, he will hold some news conferences.in his office; “other times, I'll have a meeting like this to reach the folks who the press may not he able to reach through the ordt nary newspaper or magazinle media.” The latter comment alluded to the live television and radio coverage of today's news conference. Mrs. Freeman, whom the President said he would appoim to the Civil Rights Commission is a graduate of Hampton In stitute at Hampton, Va. She holds a law degree from Howard University and has been a member of the Missouri bar sine 1949.

1438-> Downed Fliers' Release Due Today
AUSTIN, Tex, March 26—The White House announced tonight that the two United States Air Force fliers still held in East Gernany after their plane was shot down March 10 would be released tomorrow. Few details were made public by George Reedy, the White House news secretary. He said, however, that Capt David I. Holland of Holland, Minn., and Capt. Melvin J. Kessler of Philadelphia definitely would be returned to American jurisdiction tomorrow. Secretary of State Dean Rusk said on a television program last Sunday that the United States had information that the fliers would be released. He did say when or how. Mr. Reedy announced the plans for their release shortly after President Johnson arrived in Texas for an Easter holiday. He said: “This action is one that stands upon its own feet.” It has “no implications,” he said, that there would be an exchange for the men or that the United States was making any other concessions to obtain their return. Mr. Reedy, would give no information on where the fliers would be turned over to United States authorities or at what hour. He would not even specify whether his use of the word “tomorrow” referred to tomorrow in American time zones or German time zones. A third flier, First Lieut. Harold W. Welch of Detroit, Mich., was injured when the plane carrying him and the two captains was shot down by Soviet jet fighters. The three parachuted to safety. Lieutenant Welch was returned to United States jurisdiction March 21 and is in West Germany. The three fliers were snot down . in East Germany when they strayed from their course in an RB‐66 jet reconnaissance bomber. The United States has said that they were on a routine training mission. The Soviet Union originally charged espionage. Mr.Reedy said arrangemenis. for the return of Captains Holland and Kessler were being made through Anatoly F. Dobrynin, the Soviet Ambassador to the United States. The President arrived here about 6 P.M., Central standard time. Mrs. Johnson was with her husband. They then flew to the LBJ Ranch. They probably will return to Washington early next week.

1440-> PRESIDENT SEEKS NATIONAL PANEL ON AUTOMATION; Sends Proposal to Congress With a Report Analyzing Unemployment Trends
29. WASHINGTON, March 9—President Johnson asked Congress today to create a national commission on automation and technological change. The 14‐member commission would study the probable pace of technological change, the problems such change will bring and the means of speed‐ ing and increasing the benefits of advancing technology. The commission members would be drawn entirely from outside of the Government. Mr. Johnson's plan was sent to Congress today along with a detailed report on the nation's current manpower problems. The report included nearly a dozen specific proposals for dealing with excessive unemployment and other kinds of economic hardship. All of them had been made before, by Mr. Johnson, President Kennedy, or both. The manpower report also contained, however, extensive new analyses of present manpower problems, in particular one showing the relationship of education and vocational training to unemployment. The analysis, made by the Labor Department, showed that general education was more important than specific job training in keeping individuals out of the ranks of the unemployed. For example, in April of last year, high school graduates who had no formalized job training had an unemployment rate of less than 4 per cent. On the other hand, persons who had completed only eight grades of schooling but had vocational training had an unemployment rate of 7 per cent. Nevertheless, job training proved to be of lasting value, the study found. Among workers with less than a full college education who had received specific job training, four‐fifths said they had put the training to use at some time in their working lives and three‐fifths were using it in their present jobs. The most important single source of job training was high school vocational and commercial courses, the study found. One out of every six men with specific vocational training had received it in the armed forces, however. Company training programs, which are largely confined to large corporations, are relatively unimportant, except for managerial and supervisory jobs, it was found. The survey discovered that far fewer Negroes than whites were given the opportunity to use their training, or their educations. Only 43 per cent of the nonwhites with training were using it on their present jobs, compared with 60 per cent of all workers. Among Negro men who were college graduates, only 70 per cent held professional, technical or managerial jobs, whereas 80 per cent of white men so educated did. The contrast between Negro and white women on this point was found to be even more marked. Close to 20 per cent of Negro women who are high school graduates or who have had some college training are domestic workers. Only 2 per cent of white women so educated are in domestic service. Among women college graduates, on the other hand, the proportion employed in the professions is higher for Negroes than for whites. This fact reflects the opportunities for teachers in Negro schools, the report said. Minority groups other than Negroes can fare better than Negroes do, the reportindicated. The Puerto Rican population in the United States, for example, is rapidly moving up the economic scale. While a little more than 12 per cent of the entire male population in the country is engaged in professional and technical occupations, 8 per cent of all men of Puerto Rican parentage who were born in the United States now hold such jobs. This compared with less than 3 per cent for Puerto Ricans who were born in Puerto Rico and a little more than 4 per cent for Negroes. A growing tendency on the part of Negroes simply to withdraw from the work force and stop looking for jobs was highlighted by the report. Unemployment among both Negroes and whites fluctuates with general business conditions. The unemployment rate among Negroes has, however, for more than a decade, been more than twice as high as the unemployment rate among whites—and the gap is widening. Even more striking is the trend toward complete withdrawal from the work force. Among whites, somewhat fewer than 50 persons out of every thousand are neither working, looking for work or dependents of a worker. This figure has been essentially stable throughout the postwar period.

1441-> South Africa Building Military Forces to a Peak; $362.7 Million Budget Set—Internal and External Threats Are Cited
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa, March 25—South Africa is creating the strongest military force in her history. Parliament has been asked for the equivalent of $362.7 million to increase her internal security, her external defenses and her ole in the Western military complex. The defense and security request in the national budget for the 1964‐65 fiscal year represents more money than South Africa spent militarily at the height of World War II. The request by the Government of Prime Minister Hendrik F. Verwoerd is broken down as follows: ¶The equivalent of $294 million to strengthen the army, navy and air force—already the most formidable combined force in Africa south of the Sahara. This defense request includes an 11‐fold increase in funds, to the equivalent of $54.3 million, to purchase “special equipment,” including ships. ¶The equivalent of $68.7 million for the national police. The Minister of Finance, Dr. Theophilus E. Donges, in presenting the defense and security budgets, said: “This is a large increase but I am sure that this house will have no hesitation in furnishing the wherewithal to dis courage foreign aggression. I need not enlarge upon the threats which have been hurled at our country—threats which at any other time would have called down the condemnation of the civilized world.” In the same week that the budget was submitted, South Africa commissioned a new, warship and prepared to open the first of three new munitions plants. She is revamping her navy, developing rockets, stockpiling weapons and ringing the country with radar. At the same time she has purchased supersonic jet fighters. Double shifts are at work in armament factories. South Africa also is understood to be seeking to purchase at least three submarines from Britain. The country Intends to have 145,000 men under arms in varying degrees before the end of the year. South Africa's population exceeds 17 million. A total of 16,527 white youths —the equivalent of an infantry division—are to be called up for military induction by December. In effect, one of every two white males in the country who reaches the age of 17 this year will be drafted. Eventually the Government intends to train every white youth from the age of 17 to fight “even if he has flat feet.” Thousands of other whites organized as “Kommandos” will have rifles and emergency rations in their homes and farms so that they can take up defense positions at a moment's notice in case of trouble. All of this is to give South Africa a bigger “fist,” as the Government puts it, to head off chances of an internal uprising by the country's black majority, any outside invasion by “liberation” forces and any threat to the security of the centuriesold shipping route around the Cape of Good Hope. South Africa's National Police is responsible for maintaining the government's policy of apartheid or “apartness,” which decrees that the country's 3.25 million whites must be separated from its 13.8 million other people — black, Asian and mixed‐ancestry. A highly mobile force with a strength put at 29,646 men, the National Police is equipped with 429 riot trucks, 80 armored cars, 210 dogs, tear gas and automatic weapons. They are supported by a reserve understood to number 6,000 men. External defense against “liberation” forces is the job of South Africa's army. The estimated size is 19,000 regulars and an active reserve called the Citizen Force believed to number 60,000 fully trained men. The air force numbers 4,000 men and is equipped with a squadron of French Mirage fighters. South Africa's Defense Minister, Johannes J. Fouche, recently warned the rest of Africa: “Stay where you are or there will be trouble.” The protection of the Cape route would be the job of the navy. The nav, with 2,000 men, is being equipped by Britain under a 1955 agreement that gives the British Navy berthing and resupply facilities at Simonstown on the Cape of Good Hope. Britain last week turned over the last of three antisubmarine frigates built in British yards as part of the Simonstown agreement. The new vessel, the President Pretorius, is due to join the President Kruger and President Steyn in South African waters in three months. The rest of the South African navy also includes two former British destroyers refitted as helicopter‐carriers,,ten coastal minesweepers and six patrol launches. Britain has also sold South Africa four helicopters and two more are understood to be on order. South Africa intends to double the berthing capacity of the Simonstown Naval Base to accommodate her growing fleet. The air force's Frenchequipped squadron of Mirage fighters is believed to number 17. The air force also is known to have a squadron of F‐86 jet fighters reportedly made in Canada. Backing these up arc at least 62 C‐47 troop carriers and 159 Harvards, prewar American training planes, now fitted with rocket and bomb racks. France also has sold South Africa at least 50 Alouette jet helicopters. At the same time South Africa is making more of her own armament and equipment because the United States and Britain decided last year to stop selling weapons to her that might be used to “suppress” the country's people. She is making a Belgian automatic rifle and a French armored car here. She is also establishing her own munitions industry, and manufacturing 3inch antitank rockets and is trying to develop a solid‐fuel air‐to‐ground missile. Three munitions plants are being built, at cost equivalent to $28 million, by the African Explosives and Chemical Industries, Ltd.

1442-> LABOR ISSUE RISES IN CITY COLLEGES; University Asks Faculties to Choose on Unionizing
The City University of New York has asked the faculties of its seven colleges to decide whether they want a collective bargaining contract. It would be the first in higher education in the United States. Most of the 5,000 staff members are now represented by the Legislative Conference, whose governing body is a 44‐member board elected by the instructional staff. The conference asked the Administrative Council of the University last October to designate it as the sole bargaining agent. This request was challenged by the United Federation of College Teachers, a local of the American Federation of Teachers. The federation, which has only 500 members, has not asked to be bargaining agent but feels that the conference is a “company union” and should not be considered for the post. The university's council indicated it would like to retain the status quo. As a result of the conference's request and the federation's challenge, Dr. Albert H. Bowker, chancellor of the university, sent a memorandum yesterday to the instructional staffs suggesting that they hold a series of discussions to resolve the question. The memorandum, signed by the Administrative Council which comprises, in addition to the chancellor, the presidents of the colleges, noted that “insofar as we are aware this kind of collective bargaining has yet to be applied to a university structure.” The memorandum observed that professional concerns of the staff were now protected in every area through the bylaw structure. A statement appended to the memorandum by Dr. William Gomberg, Professor of Industry of the Wharton School, the University of Pennsylvania, said that the bylaws “endow the faculties with powers of participation in administrative affairs above and beyond the standards promulgated by the Association of University Professors.” This participation, the memaranaum said, included a degree or control over educational policies, curriculum, granting of degrees, student activities, student discipline, appointment, tenure, promotion and compensation. “Should all these matters,” the memorandum asked, “remain within the control of the scholars and teachers to whom they are entrusted by the bylaws ?” The extent of this control, the memorandum indicated, would be drastically reduced under a bargaining contract. It maintained that the only legitimate area for the application of collective bargaining techniques would be matters of personal interest to faculty members. Prof. Belle Zeller of Brooklyn College, who is chairman of the conference, said that collective bargaining either by certification or election “is the only logical step for enlightened staff relations,” but added that the conference would accept whatever decision was ultimately made. As to the challenge by the college teachers' federation, Professor Zeller said that while the organization was too small now to contend for the collective bargaining post she could recall when the United Federation of Teachers was small but grew up to become the agent for the city's public school teachers.

1443-> NIXON SAYS TICKET MAY GET KENNEDY; But Thinks Johnson Prefers Humphrey for Campaign
WASHINGTON, April 18—A strong Republican ticket will win the Democratic Vice‐Presidential nomination for Robert F. Kennedy, the nation's newspaper editors were told today by Richard M. Nixon. A lackluster Republican ticket will mean that President Johnson will pick Senator Rubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, "whom he likes best,” said Mr. Nixon in a talk at the Statler Hotel to members of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Mr. Nixon called this “a professional's judgment.” He said that “if the polls are like they are now” when the Democrats convene in Atlantic City, “it will be Humphrey.” But if they are closer and “it appears there will be a fight, it will be Bobby.” In a question period that followed a speech devoted to problems of American foreign policy in Southeast Asia, Mr. Nixon startled a room full of newspapermen by saying, in response to a question, of his recent visit to Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge in Saigon, South Vietnam: “We had a very interesting discussion. In fact, we made a deal. He's going to put a Pepsi Cola freezer in the embassy.” Mr. Nixon is an attorney for the Pepsi Cola Company. In addition to explaining again that he was not a candidate for the Republican nomination, Mr. Nixon carefully said he thought each of the contenders was still in the race. But he talked most about the problems for Ambassador Lodge. Mr. Nixon said the Ambassador was executing policies made in Washington, but he added that “obviously his advice is sought and sometimes taken.” “If he wants to be a candidate,” Mr. Nixon said of his 1960 running mate, “I would hope he will make foreign policy an issue.” This would mean, he said, that Mr. Lodge would resign as Ambassador and return to the United States to attack some of the policies that created the present situation in South Vietnam. “Whoever is the candidate on the Republican ticket should make that an issue,” Mr. Nixon said. He said again that he was not a candidate, but that as titular leader of his party he felt the obligation to take any assignment given tO him. He does not expect to be nominated, but hopes to campaign on the foreign‐policy issue in many important House and Senate races, he said. In his speech, Mr. Nixon said he had found that the United States had lost confidence among the Ieaders of the nations he visited. He said the murder of President Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam was disastrous to United States support among these leaders, who took it as a betrayal of the regime by the United States. He also said that the United States must recognize that “all the chips are now in the pot” in South Vietnam. He said this war concerned not Vietnam, but all of Southeast Asia. If we surrender there, he said, it will be a signal to Asians that the United States has no answer to the Communist thrust there. Mr. Nixon said he did not agree that the contest could be confined to South Vietnam. He asked that it be extended to Laos or to North Vietnam. He would have the South Vietnamese troops “in hot pursuit” of the Communist guerrillas into Laos, he said, adding that he would not limit carrying the fight into North Vietnam to “hot pursuit.” He said the goal of the soutn Vietnamese Army must be a free North Vietnam, and that the war must be carried north to achieve that goal. Earlier today, the editors heard Gov. George Romney of Michigan and Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine. Governor Romney has been discussed as a possible Republican nominee, but today he asserted again in positive terms that he would not be a candidate. Senator Smith has been a candidate, but seemed to agree today that her candidacy was not serious. The editors were also to have heard Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, and copies of the Senator's speech were provided to the press room. However, Senator Goldwater a general in the Air Force Reserve, took an early‐morning training flight to Montgomery, Ala., today, where he had plane tronble and was unable to fill his engagement. Governor Romney called himself “the only noncandidate that is still a Simon‐pure noncandidate who has made it perfectly clear he will, regardless of events or circumstances, remain a noncandidate.” Then, as if to emphasize his position, he spoke entirely about the problems of Michigan. If Senator Goldwater had been able to deliver his speech, he would have taken a position on South Vietnam somewhat like the one advocted by Mr. Nixon. He would have asked that “we take some action that will actually force the Vietcong to give up the fight.” This could mean “messing up some roads, hitting some depots, and stopping some shipping.” In his “professional's opinion” on the state of the Republican nomination contest, Mr. Nixon cautioned against the premature dismissal of Senator Goldwater's hopes. “At the present time, there is too much tendency to write off Goldwater,” he said. “Delegates nominate and Goldwater is very close to have the requisite numbers. If he wins in California, either he will be the candidate, or he will name him.”

1444-> Homefolks Entertain; Queens Groups Try Hard to Be Heard Over Planes and Crowds at State Talent Show
THE homefolks entertained with music and dancing yesterday at the New York State Pavilion at the World's Fair. They'll be doing the same from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M. throughout the fair. Yesterday it was the turn of the Forest Hills High School, Public Schools 168, 154 and 196, Stern's Department Store, the Longines Symphonette, the Kew Gardens Little League, the West Side Tennis Club, the First Presbyterian Church of Forest Hills, the Long Island Institute of Music (School of Ballet) and many others. The State Fair Commission already has more than 500 events scheduled for its sum‑ mer‐long talent show. The events are arranged so that a geographical community, an ethnic group or some cause or other group has a full day. Yesterday it was the turn of the neighboring Queens communities of Forest Hills, Kew Gardens and Mew Gardens Hills. About the only time the performances can be heard is early in the dlay. For example, yesterday the Forest Hills High band came through loud and clear, but that was because it went on at 11 A.M. The pavilion was not yet crowded and the band competed mostly with the airplanes or helicopters overhead. But when the high school orchestra played at about 1 P.M., the general buzz and conversation from the crowd was so great that the performance was academic. From very, very close by you could tell that all these groups were credits to their communities. The dancers made out better. They performed in the center of the pavilion on the huge terrazzo map of the state, 130 by 166 feet, set in the floor. There were some fine whirls and turns over the Adirondacks, a great procession down Route 7 from Albany to Binghamton. Everything was colorful and neat, except for one girl who stepped over the line into Pennsylavnia. State Senator Seymour Thaler and Assemblyman Moses M. Weinstein, both Democrats of Queens, were listed as co‐hosts for yesterday's performances, but Senator Thaler carried on alone because Mr. Weinstein was ill. Actually the pavilion is a great place to visit, even if you can't hear the music. The state's schools, bands, choruses, tennis clubs, gymnasts, barbershop quartets and accordion players provide a county fair atmosphere in very urbane surroundings. And if the noise gets too Ioud, visitors can duck into the New York State Council on the Arts booth where a quiet exhibit of early Ameri‑ can art has been set up.

1445-> RIGHTS SUIT WINS HOUSE FOR NEGRO; Yonkers White Man, Facing State Action, Accepts Bid
A Yonkers homeowner, facing state action on charges that he refused to sell his house to a Negro, has agreed to the sale. The 54‐year‐old white homeowner, Matty Principe, was accused of offering to sell the tWo story house to a white man for $34,500 after having refused to sell it to the Negro, Walter Beaman, for $36,000, the original asking price. Mr. Principe's change was disclosed yesterday by the State Commission for Human Rights, which was investigating the case. The commission said that the sale of the one‐family house at 123 Halsey Road had been arranged for $36,000 at a meet‐ ing on Tuesday in the Yonkers office of Mr. Principe's lawyer, John N. Romano. Under the contract terms, Mr. Beaman, who lives with his wife and two daughters in Dyckman Houses at 3736 10th Avenue made a $1,400 deposit. He has 20 days to complete the purchase. Civil rights officials consider the case significant because it was the first time the state had sought and won a “freeze” injunction against a homeowner accused of discrimination. Injunction Delayed Sale The injunction, which was signed in State Supreme Court in Westchester County, barred Mr. Principe from selling the house to anyone until the complaint had been resolved by the Riahts Commission. Mr. Beaman, a liquor salesman, filed his complaint with the commission on March 16. Bernard Katzen, the commission's vice chairman, investigated and found “probable cause” and asked the Attorney General's office to seek an injunction. Since early attempts at con‐ ciliation had failed the commission scheduled a public hearing for next Monday. Because of the new development, the commission said it had adjourned the hearing indefinitely. That means that if the sale goes through, the hearing will probably be canceled. It would have determined whether Mr. Principe had violated the state law against discrimination in housing—a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $500 fine. The Principe home is on the edge of the predominantly white Crestwood area of Yonkers. The immediate neighborhood is a recently developed area of homes in the $30,000 to $50,000 class.

1446-> Carlos Hevia, President of Cuba For Three Days in 1934, Dead
LANTANA, Fla., April 3 (AP)—Carlos Hevia, who once served as President of Cuba, died last night at Lantana near West Palm Beach . He was 64 years old. Mr. Hevia was President of Cuba for three days in 1934. He had taken part in an unsuccessful coup against the dictator Gerardo Machado in 1931. He was captured at the battle of Gibara, imprisoned and later sent into exile. When Fulgencio Batista, then an army sergeant, began his 11year tenure as Cuba's strong man in 1933 with the elevation of Ramon Grau San Martin as President, Mr. Hevia served as Secretary of Agriculture. Four months later, in 1934, Batista removed Grau from the presidency. Mr. Hevia was named provisional president and he ruled for three days beginning Jan. 15. Then Batista deposed him and named Col. Carlos Mendieta President. Colonel Mendieta was the first of a s uccession of Presidents, all of whom were controlled by Batista as commander in chief of the Army. Mr. Hevia's father, Col. Aurelio Hevia, was prominent in the early years of the Republic and served as Secretary of the Interior beginning in 1913. Mr. Hevia was educated in schools in Cuba and the United States Naval Academy, from which he graduated in 1919. Returning to Cuba, he established himself as an engineer. He was a creator of the Authentic Cuban Revolutionary party in February, 1934, and was a member of its executive committee and its national insurrectional committee. Batista had himself elected President in 1940. In 1942 he appointed Mr. Hevia head of the Office of Price Control and Supply. During the World War II Mr. Hevia played an important part in coordinating Cuba's efforts with those of the Allies. When Carlos Prio Socarras was elected President in 1948 Mr. Hevia was appointed Minister of State. In the post he traveled with President Prio on a state visit to the United States that year. In 1949 and 1950 Mr. Hevia served as Foreign Minister, then as Minister of Agriculture. In 1951 President Prio named him Minister Without Portfolio and president of the National Development Commission. Then the Autenticos chose him to succeed President Prio. He resigned and campaigned during 1952 but the election was never held. Batista staged a coup and took over the Government. Mr. Hevia was outspoken in his denunciation of the coup and its leaders and had to join the government in exile. He and other leaders met in Montreal in 1953 and planned the overthrow of the Batista regime. But a heart attack late in 1953 restricted his political activity thereafter. He married Miss Elisa Edelmann in 1933. They had a son, Aurelio, and a daughter, Margarita. He returned to Cuba and took part in the overthrow of the Batista regime. But when Fidel Castro took over, once again he had to flee. He was active in the Revolutionary Council that sought to overthrow the Castro regime through the Bay of Pigs invasion. He had been picked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs if the council had been able to establish a government.

1447-> What's in a Shoe Name? Mainly Confusion, Shoppers Discover; Labels Found Poor Guide to Source of Footwear
CUSTOMER ordered a pair of shoes in a special color at the Delman Salon in Bergdorf Goodman the other day. To fill the order, the buyer called the I. Miller‐Christian Dior wholesale division of Gefiesco (the diversified retail and wholesale apparel and shoe corporation that also owns a minority interest in Rayne‐Del:man, proprietors of the salon) to order the Christian Dior shoe manufactured by the Carlisle Shoe Company in Pennsylvania. When it arrived, it carried a Delman label. But that isn't all. The identical design, bearing the Dior label, was being sold at Bonwit Teller as well as in other stores without a brand label. These shoes, however, are unrelated to the House of Dior in Paris except through a licensing agreement for use of the Dior name. Dior shoes sold in Europe are manufactured there by Charles Jourdan, whose American distributor is Jack Hinton International, owned by Mr.and Mrs. Jerrold Miller she is Margaret Clark of Margaret Jerrold). Hinton sells other Jourdan shoes with brand labels to Altman's and without the labels to other stores including Delman. Obviously, the woman who shops for better shoes in New York needs a score card. Mabel Julianelli's shoes, manctured by Howard Fox, are sold under her name at Bonwit's and unbranded at I. Miller Salons. Margaret Jerrold shoes can be identified as such at Lord & Taylor but go unlabeled at Bonwit's. David Evins shoes manufactured in his Manhattan factory he also produces a slightly less expensive pump in an upstate facility) come with his label at the I. Miller salons, without it at Altman's, Delman and Saks Fifth Avenue, to name a few. He also manufactures about 450 pairs of shoes a day in the factory of the late Herman Delman, which he now owns. The shoes are sold under the Delman label. Some shoes made here by Caprini and in France by Charles Jourdan also go under the Delman label. Saks Fifth Avenue's Fenton Last shoes are made, in the main, by M. Lauer, but also by Evins and Julianelli. Herbert Levine shoes are branded at Bonwit's and unbranded at Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue. No wonder that women are confused. No wonder also that shoe salesmen smirk when a customer says, “Don't show me so‐and‐so's shoes. They don't fit me.” Chances are she maybe wearing so‐and‐so's shoes with someone else's label. This bewildering state of affairs is rooted in one of the traditions of the currently ailing better‐shoe business. Retailers insist on exclusivity of a designer's name. As a result, manufacturers are obliged to sell their shoes with their labels in them to one store in a city, and sell unmarked copies to other stores whose salesmen may whisper in their customers' “This is an Evins (or a Levine) shoe.” Not surprisingly, the one point of unanimity among the shrinking band of New York designers and manufacturers who represent the couture element in American footwear is in at fixing blame for their woes on retailers. The major problem in high‐fashion, high‐priced shoes is that not enough of them are sold. The fashion mystique as promulgated in the design schools and practiced by fashion editors has always been to measure a woman's style sense feet first. Buy a $40 shoe, fortify it with a $200 handbag and watch your elegance quotient soar. According to this philosophy, a wonan can get away with a $30 dress and a cloth coat as long as she is expensively shod. Unfortunately for the bettershoe manufacturers, this message has never rippled beyond a tiny nucleus. The typical American woman subscribes to the theory of the mink coat or the Norell dress and the inexpensive shoe. According to the National Shoe Institute, the number of factories in New York City turning out top‐quality shoes has dwindled in the last 30 years from 360 to 18. More graphic evidence lies in the disappearance as distinct entities of well‐known brand names like Delman and Palter DeLiso (whose shoes no longer emanate from a DeLiso factory but from the workrooms of D'Antonio, contractors also for Margaret Jerrold shoes). Throughout the country, fewer customers are drawn to the wares of the top‐flight manufacturers as better‐shoe stores and departments are devoured by dollars‐and‐cents‐minded corporations that are disinclined to take a chance on offering women a full range of a leading designer's work. Today's shoe snobs are detecting status in the conservative De Busschere shoes (made completely by hand in Belgium and selling here for about $55 and up at Belgian Shoes, Inc.), the delicate Italian creations of Silvia of Fiorentina and the smooth designs of David Evins (including the Delman, lowheeled, Marquise pump). The presence of foreign names on the list comes, ironically, at a time when disenchantment with foreign‐made shoes has set in with many consumers and buyers. The made‐in‐U S.A. shoe is a masterpiece of construction, engineered to fit almost to perfection hundreds of different feet. European women, unlike their finicky American sisters, accept shoes that come in one or two widths and that make no pretense at fitting their feet or being comfortable. Roger Vivier, the Parisian who is considered one of the most creative designers of footwear, recognized this fact when he signed an exclusive contract last year with Saks Fifth Avenue. The Vivier collections that originate in his Paris salon (both ready‐made and custom departments) can now be bought in 21 Saks stores and in Neiman‐Marcus. The American copies, which are manufactured by M. Lauer, a factory that works solely for Saks, are markedly superior to the French originals, Mr. Vivier said on his last visit here. Nevertheless, the designers and manufacturers of shoes that combine high fashion with the highest standards of workmanship are fighting for survival against unfavorable economic odds. Theirs is an archaic industry that has no fund for design, research and development. Beth Levine, one of the most prolific talents in recent years, and a perfectionist who refuses to release a design until she is convinced that it fits the foot as well as the eye, has consistently found her work copied and in the windows of cheap shoe stores before she has delivered her own merchandise to her customers. The industry is also afflicted with high overhead and labor cost, low productivity and frequently strained labor relations. In 1962, Genesco closed the New York factories of I. Miller following a strike by the United Shoe Workers of America. Shoes bearing the I. Miller label are now manufactured by the Carlisle Shoe Company of Carlisle and Harrisburg, Pa., as are the Mademoiselle Shoes, one of the medium‐priced ($20) divisions of Genesco. Manufacturers of quality shoes, like their counterparts in the coat and suit industry, complain of shortages of skilled help caused by the drying up of the reservoir of immigrant labor and by the fact that the cobbier's son, like the tailor's, becomes a psychiatrist or a salesman rather than follow in his father's footsteps. “In five years, the machine will have to replace people doing many of our hand operations,” says Isadore Lauer, president of M. Lauer, where, up to the point of attaching the sole, the Vivier shoes are made entirely by hand. Mr. Lauer's dismay is echoed by most of his peers although not by David Evins, a designer‐manufacturer who has scored a personal and financial triumph in a period when his industry has steadily deteriorated. “If I can't get a man to do folding, I will get a machine that does it, probably more efficiently and more uniformly,” Mr. Evins declares. Nevertheless, Mr. Evins acknowledges that price alone is no longer a reliable barometer of quality. Although shoe prices have gone up less than many other items of apparel in the last decade, some of the highestpriced shoes have become more expensive without a corresponding rise in their intrinsic value. At $32 to $40, any of the shoes shown in the process of manufacture in the above photographs is a bargain in terms style, workmanship, fit and comfort. But there are some shoes selling for more than $30 (the boundary line separating the medium from the expensive shoe) that are not worth $10 more than a shoe selling for slightly more than $20 and made by the same source. Actually, the medium‐priced shoe (from $16 to $30).has improved significantly in the last 15 years. In this price bracket, the consumer can often find a pair of shoes that contains leather, heels, lining and insoles about as good as those in most $35 shoes. She may also find good original design. One of the surprising turns in recent shoe history has been the willingness of some lowerprice manufacturers to at last pay for design rather than steal it. Margaret Clark, the imaginative designer of Margaret Jerrold shoes, has completed freelance assignments for Ad Lib (about $20), Saks Fifth Avenue's seventh‐floor collection, and the Deb Shoe Company (about $13), as well as for Baker shoes (about $8). In one respect, all Americanmade shoes (except for custommade shoes) are alike today. Since the late nineteen‐thirties, when a revolutionary process was developed, all soles have been cemented to uppers in a machine. The process laid the path for greater efficiency and improved quality in cheaper, mass‐produced footwear. Concurrently, the practice of making fine shoes entirely by hand died out., Today, the differencebetween medium‐priced and expensive footwear is chiefly in the number of hand operations and the time spent on the last. One of the chief virtues of a finely made, higher‐priced shoe is longevity. Properly cared for, a good shoe, like a well‐tailored suit, can last for several years.

1449-> APPAREL MAKERS SEE RISING COSTS; Wage Pattern in New York Agreement Is Proposed for Rest of Industry; DRESS PRICES AFFECTED; Dubinsky Tells Trade Group of Union Plans to Seek New Pay Increases
MIAMI BEACH, Feb. 28 —The pattern of wage increases established in the New York dress industry earlier this month will be sought in the rest of the women's apparel industry. This was disclosed here today by David Dubinsky, president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, at the closing session of a three‐day meeting in the Barcelona Hotel held by the National Board of the Coat and Suit Industry. Manufacturers attending the meeting of the board, which is a labor‐management group concerned with promotional and marketing problems of the women's and children's coat and suit industry, asserted that any wage increase would have to be passed on to the consumer. On the basis of the New York dress agreement, wage costs are expected to increase by 8 to 1012 per cent over a three‐year period, bringing a comparable rise in the price of most wonen's and children's apparel. At a news conference, Mr. Dubinsky pointed out that the union maintained a policy of seeking wage rates that were at least 15 per cent over the national minimum for workers in the lowest category. It is now felt, he said, that additional increases are necessary and they will be sought by the establishment of craft minimums. In the dress agreement, minimums for operators were raised from $1.74 to $1.90 an hour, pressers from $2.07 to $2.28 and cutters from $2.46 to $2.86. The over‐all package increase included added employer contributions to give workers a second week of vacation as well as an increase in health and retirement benefits. The next contract to be negotiated is one for the New York coat and suit trade by a cloak, suit and skirt division of the International Ladies Garment Workers. The unit will begin talks with manufacturers in New York on March 12. The present agreement expires May 31. Agreements reached in New York are generally followed in contracts in other cities when labor pacts come up for renewal. The trend in apparel production in giant companies such as Bobbie Brooks, Inc., with a diversity of products, has brought about the need for independent agreements rather than those negotiated collectively with associations representing various segments of the apparel industry. In the case of Bobbie Brooks, Mr. Dubinsky said, an independent national labor agreement was written encompassing all plants of the company. In order to extend the management‐labor relationship, Bobbie Brooks and the union have appointed a joint labor‐management committee that will consider the growth problems of the company as well as other problems. Joseph L. Dubow, executive director of the New York Coat and Suit Association and chairman of the board's public relations committee, said his committee would initiate conferences with retailers, fabric suppliers and fashion editors for achieving a better trade and product image for the industry. Joseph L. Rubin, executive director of the Infants' and Children's Coat Association of New York, told the meeting that children's wear manufacturers should assume leadership in determining how children should be clothed. Their attire, he said, should not be dictated by fads such as the Beatles have begun. Ashley Montagu, professor of anthropology at Rutgers University, said clothes definitely influence children's behavior. He said that children should be dressed as children and not as diminutive adults. A neatly dressed child, he asserted, is attractive to other children and is therefore likely to get along better with them. Nathaniel H. Mendelson, executive director of the Youth Fashion Guild, a New York buying office for children's wear, told the group that children's coat manufacturers were placing too much emphasis on price. Almost 75 per cent of all girls' coats offered, he said, are brought out at special prices with a consequent de‐emphasis on quality. Max E. Weinstock, president of the Rothmoor Corporation, Chicago, was re‐elected chairman of the board. Samuel Sandhaus, New York, was re‐elected vice‐president; Leon Frechtel, New York, treasurer, and Wilbur Daniels, executive secretat'y.

1450-> SKIING PROGRESS IN MICHIGAN; Initial Stage of a Huge Development Opened —Triple Chairlifts
HARBOR SPRINGS, Mich. —The first stage of a projected $10 million ski development was opened recently near this Lower Peninsula town, about 50 miles south of the Straits of Mackinac. It includes two triple chairlifts, said to be the first anywhere, with a capacity of 3,600 skiers an hour. The new development underscores the fact that northern Michigan, once known only as a summer resort area, now attracts sports enthusiasts and vacationists on a year‐round basis. Winter sports, in fact, have grown phenomenally in this region. As an example, the new ski facilities at Harbor Springs are an offshoot of the 15‐year‐old Boyne Mountain Lodge opera‐i tion at nearby Boyne Fails. Boyne Mountain opened with one double chairlift and a main building accommodating 30 overnight guests. Today, Boyne Mountain can house 400 guests “on the slopes” and the facility boasts snowmaking machines, five chairlifts, T‐bar and J‐bar lifts and a rope tow. About 100,000 skiers a year, from as far away as Mexico and South America, are drawn to Boyne Falls by the project's extensive and superbly groomed slopes, The Harbor Springs area is about a 30‐minute drive north from Boyne Mountain, via U.S. 131 to Petoskey and then along U.S. 31 and State Route 131 to Boyne Highlands, as the new development is called. Because both facilities are under the same management, all ski tickets are interchangeable. Unlike Boyne Mountain, which is known for its advanced slopes and open‐faced terrain, the Highlands area has a variety of sheltered trails. Seven free‐form runs, each 100 feet wide, wind down through the wooded slopes to the new stoneand‐timber ski lodge. Near the entrance to the lodge is an old waterwheel. During the summer months, it wiIl be put to work circulating spring water through the building's air‐conditioning system. In addition to the 70 rooms already completed, 100 more are scheduled for completion by next spring. At present, dining facilities accommodate 450 persons. The new triple chairlift should reduce appreciably the often tiresome business of waiting in line for a lift to the top of the slopes. Couples load from the right, and single skiers from the left. The design of Boyne Highland's slopes permits novice and advanced skiers to make the runs together. According to James Dilworth, area project manager, the layout provides “plenty of challenges for the advanced skier — along the steeper side, where there are some sharp drop‐offs‐and the beginner can tackle the gentler center slope.” The area's permanent ski school and racing course are supervised by Othmar Schnerder, who won the men's slalom event for Austria in the 1952 Olympics. In the summer, Mr. Schneider directs a ski school in Portillo, Chile. The Austrian, or reverse shoulder technique, is the only method taught at Boyne. There are about 30 certified instructors. Most skiers arrive by car. It ts just 999 miles from 14Ian‐hattan to Boyne Falls. A new freeway. Interstate 75, has cut the driving time from Detroit to less than five hours. A number of ski clubs, mainly from the Midwest, come by chartered buses, and there are generally 15 or 20 such group arrivals every weekend. Individuals can charter special buses from Chicago, 340 miles away, for a round‐trip fare of $15. There is no longer any train service to the area, but North Central Airlmes has two flights a day into Pellston, 15 minutes by car from the Highlands. The airline recently announced that any group of 10 or more skiers will receive a discount of 20 per cent on each ticket from Detroit or Chicago. Private planes, often as many as 30 on winter weekends, use the yearround facilities at the nearby Harbor Springs or Boyne Mountain airports. Budget‐minded skiers can find accommodations in the surrounding area for as little as $15 for a weekend. This usually includes Friday and Saturday night lodging, plus breakfast and dinner on Saturday and breakfast Sunday morning. Lift tickets cost $11 for the twoday weekend. Special ski‐week package arrangements for five days (Monday through Friday) range from $90 to $145. The package price generally includes lift tickets, ski instruction and use of the heated outdoor pool. Ski equipment can be rented for $5 a day. For those who decide to drop in on the spur of the moment, there are several excellent specialty shops that stock everything a skier might need. At Boyne Mountain, skiing parents can enroll their offspring‐age 6 or older‐in a special children's activity program at a cost of $7.50 for five‐day period. The daily program consists of four hours of ski instruction, and lunch and dinner with the instructors in the lodge. After‐dinner entertainment ranges from movies to sleigh rides. The healthy annual snowfall in this area is bolstered by the prevailing westerly winds that blow snow inland from Lake Michigan. This section of the state is roughly comparable to the snow belt around Buffalo. A stringent safety code, enacted in February, 1962, and operating through the State Labor Department, protects Michigan skiers. The Michigan State Lift Safety Commission is responsihle for inspection of all mechanical skilifts. This inspection is patterned after the American Standards Code designed by registered engineers.

1453-> Suit Says Park Took Gifts From Japanese
SEOUL, South Korea April 8—An Opposition lead er filed a criminal suit agains Chung Hee Park today charging him with “incurring foreign troubles” in current negotiations to normalize relations with Japan. The criminal charge, which was also brought against Mr. Park's chief adviser, Kim Jong Pil, chairman of the ruling Democratic Republican party, alleged that the two Koreans had accepted secret gifts of money from Japan during the negotiations. Kim Joon Yun, leader of the Opposition Liberal Democratic party, said in his written accusation that Mr. Park and Mr. Kim had received $130 million from Japan to finance the organization of the Democratic Republican party and the election campaign that brought it to power last year. Earlier this week Kim Joon Yun was charged by the ruling party with libel and defamation for making public his charge against President Park.

1455-> Nicklaus Is Confident of Being First to Win Masters Title Twice in Row; DEFENDER REVISES HIS PUTTING STYLE; Ace Also Changes Swing in Tactical Switch for Event Opening Tomorrow
AUGUSTA, Ga., April 7—As pre‐tournament tension increased for those awaiting the start of the Masters golf tournament, Jack Nicklaus, the defender, today expressed confidence about his chances of becoming the first to win the title two years in a row. The Augusta National Golf Club course over which the 24year‐old Nicklaus and about 98 other golfers will open play on Thursday was closed yesterday and until 11 o'clock this morning because of rain. The players were notified that practice rounds would be halted at the first sign of more rain. However, most of them were able to complete their rounds. The course will also be closed tomorrow afternoon as is customary on the eve of the event. However, the threat of a thunderstorm and overcast skies made some of the players a little jittery. They lingered much of the time around the practice areas close to the clubhouse. Some of them, including Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, played the adjoining par 3 course just to overcome nervousness while waiting for starting times to be assigned on the regular course. Game In Peak Form Nicklaus believes his game is close to its peak form. The Masters is especially significant for him. “No one has ever won here twice in succession and I want to,” he said. “But I don't want to become tense. I was tense at Brookline. I hope it doesn't happen here.” Nicklaus was alluding to the 1963 United States Open. He was the defending champion that year at Brookline, Mass. He was so tense he failed to qualify for the final 36 holes. Two things have also buoyed Nicklaus's hope. He has adopted a new putting method and he has recaptured the rhythm of his swing. During the Greensboro Open in North Carolina last week he tried his new putting style. He has modified his crouching stance. Now he places the putter on the green behind the ball before taking his stance and stroking the ball. Previously he took his stance first and then adjusted his putting stroke. Nicklaus credits Phil Rodgers with a suggestion that has helped him bring his arms higher at the follow‐through for a more rhythmic swing. Although Nicklaus is the leading money winner of the tour this season with earnings of $20,050, the Columbus, Ohio, golfer regards a victory in the Masters as a “stepping stone to everything.” Hogan Putting Well Nicklaus played the par‐3 nine‐hole course in two under par and later played the regular layout. Among those in his foursome in the afternoon was Ben Hogan. Hogan, who has won the Masters twice, is a surprise entrant. He missed playing last year and said he would not return until his putting improved. “I am putting much better—at least in practice,” said Hogan. Nicklaus considers Palmer, who will seek his fourth Masters crown, as one of the favorites to win. Gary Player, the South African who won the Masters in 1961, is taking medication for an attack of tonsilitis. Julius Boros, the National Open champion, appeared refreshed and relaxed on the links. Both are top contenders to score a triumph.

1457-> CEYLON BIDS CHOU YIELD ON BORDER; Chinese Said to Be Cool to Gesture Toward India
COLOMBO, Ceylon, Feb. 28—Premier Chou En‐lai was reported today to have given a cool but not wholly negative reply to Ceylonese recommendations that Communist China evacuate military posts in adakh, occupied since the in asion of India in 1962. Ceylonese quarters indicated tonight that the Chinese Premier had told the Prime Minister, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, that he must consult his Government in Peking before taking any decision on the question. Other reports said he had suggested that China might quit some but not all of the posts. The Ceylonese believe that agreement to evacuate the posts might lead to a peaceful negotiated settlement of the bitter border dispute between China and India, which broke into open war 16 months ago. The war was halted when the victorious Chinese invaders proclaimed a cease‐fire, but an intense diplomatic conflict has continued between India and China.  At what had been schedule as a “mammoth rally” organized by the Government political party, Mr. Chou said that he hoped for a peaceful settlement of the conflict and that “the great friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples will be maintained and developed.” Only about 1,500 persons attended the rally, which was dampened by rain. Mr. Chou was an hour late in arriving and a Ceylonese band amused those who had braved the rain by playing selections from “South Pacific,” including “I'm Going to Wash That Man Right Out of My Hair” and “There's Nothing Like a Dame.” Mrs. Bandaranaike also spoke at the rally, recalling the meeting of neutralist Asian and African nations held in Colombo in December, 1962, ill an unsuccessful move to settle the conflict. The neutralist powers recommended evacuation of the Ladakh posts taken by the Chinese forces in a no man's land at the north of India. India has said she would negotiate with the Chinese if they accepted the Colombo proposals. Substantive talks between Mr. Chou and Mrs. Bandaranaike went into their second day today behind closed doors and in an atmosphere of maximum diplomatic discretion. The fact that the Ceylonese Finance and Trade Ministers were called in indicated that Mrs. Bandaranaike had broached the subject of possible Chinese aid to Ceylon's faltering economy. A final communiqué is expected tomorrow. Mr. Chou is scheduled to leave early Sunday morning.

1460-> Nixon, in Jest, Urges Top Place For Johnson on Speeding Ticket
With the song “I Left My Heart In San Francisco” playing in the background and the scent of political conventions heavy in the air, Richard M. Nixon offered President Johnson first place on a speeding ticket yesterday. Asking the President to “take a bus and leave the driving to us,” the former Vice President also offered Mr. Johnson exclusive rights to the makeup man who made Mr. Nixon look bad in his first television debate with President Kennedy. The offers, made as a gesture of warm bipartisanship, came from Mr. Nixon as he joined Senator Barry Goldwater, Governor Rockefeller, Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge and Harold A. Stassen as the “Fall Guy Presidential Candidates of 1964.” Mr. Nixon and the other potential contenders for the Republican Presidential nomination—avowed or otherwise —were roasted as the butts of songs, skits and scurrilities yesterday afternoon in the smokefilled Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf‐Astoria Hotel. The lampooning was staged by the Circus Saints and Sinners, a men's club devoted to charity, fun and making public figures uncomfortable. Mr. Nixon was the guest of honor. The program began as actors portraying the various Repub‐ lican contenders came on stage. Mr. Goldwater was a cowboy; Mr. Rockefeller carried a pizza; Mr. Lodge looked like Jungle Jim, and an actor resembling Mr. Nixon was trailed by hostile reporters. Later, Gov. William W. Scranton of Pennsylvania, played by a coal miner, Gov. George Romney of Michigan, portrayed as a lumberjack, and Mr. Stassen, cast as a tramp, joined the players. They all took a beating as Mr. Nixon's stand‐in—wincing and helpless—looked on. The actor who resembled him sang “Gimme A Little Kiss, Willya Huh?” as: “Gimme another chance—” He finished with “I Left My Heart in San Francisco, And it still hurts today. . . .”

At present, the state‐run corporation obtains gasoline from the Soviet Union, Rumania and the United Arab Republic. But according to corporation sources, supplies from the United Arab Republic have been hampered by the lack of tankers of required carrying capacity. Ministerial sources say quotations will be sought from all oil‐producing countries to avoid a breakdown of supplies. Though purchases from the Soviet Union and Rumania could be increased, the Government does not want to depend on only two countries for gasoline supplies.

1468-> Peoplewise
Even before they return as promised to their native England, they have set minds across the United States to wondering what the uproar was all about. They—the Beatles, of course —were seen and heard by, and conquered, millions of Americans. How, people are asking, could four mop‐headed, neo‐Edwardian‐attired, Liverpudlian‐accented, guitar‐playing, drum‐beating, “little boys” from across the ocean come here and attract the immense amount of attention they did by stomping and hollering out songs in a musical idiom that is distinctly American? Ask a typical Beatle fan—female, in her early teens—and she will say it is because: “They're so keee-ooot.” Or because: “They're different! They're just so different!” Adults, some but not all of whom view the Beatles somewhat cynically, are likely to say that the craze sprang from the high‐powered promotion that performers received before their arrival and throughout their stay. Social scientists agree with both the adult and teen‐age views but note that, no matter how effective the promotion of the Beatles may have been, the public response to them was real and deserves a deeper probe for its origins within the needs and attitudes of the Beatlemaniac himself. Practically every standard explanation in the book has been offered by psychologists and psychiatrists for Beatlemania. The Beatles, these analyses say, serve as symbols of: ¶Adolescent revolt against parental authority. ¶Status that comes from belonging to a group, in this case, of other Beatlemaniacs. ¶Sex, both from the supposed erotic nature of the Beatles' music and the way they perform it and from the appeal they seem to have to the “mother instinct.” ¶Success by persons who are seen as fellow teen‐agers (although none of the Beatles are under 21) and as underdogs who came from the wrong side of the tracks and have made good. ¶The frenetically felt urgency for having a good time and living life fast in an uncertain world plagued with mortal dangers. Any or all of those explanations of Beatlemania may be more or less correct, in the opinion of a young Barnard College sociologist whose shoulder‐length brown hair tends to flop Veronica Lake‐fashion over one eye and who remembers attending a “Hit Parade” broadcast in the midst of girls her own age who shrieked and swooned into their bobby socks over Frank Sinatra. But she thinks the most important answers to the Beatlemania question run much deeper than sex and status. She believes, moreover, that the phenomenon could serve as an ideal subject for a sociological study of the dynamics of fads and crazes and of social stratification. The sociologist's name is Renee Claire Fox. She is an assistant professor of sociology at Barnard, but her researches have taken her as far away in last two years as Belgium, where she studied the conduct of medical research and the scientists who do it, and the Congo. Although those experiences do not qualify her as an expert on such matters as Beatlemania, her general sociological training has given her insight into the kinds of questions that could be asked about such a phenomenon. In fact, she has developed a theory to explain Beatlemania and last week even explored ways of testing it as an exercise for students in the course on sociological research that she teaches. Dr. Fox's theory is essentially this: The wide range of the Beatles' appeal stems from their personification of many forms of duality that exist in our society. The Beatles, she says, constitute a treasure trove of such dualities. For example, she explains, they are male and yet have many feminine characteristics, especially their floppy hairdos. They also play the dual roles of both adults and children. And they appear to be good boys who nevertheless dress and pose as bad ones—London's Teddyboys. Their fancy, Edwardian clothes suggest a sort of sophistication that, Dr. Fox believes, contrasts further with their “homespun” style of performance. Much has been made of their poor, lower‐class backgrounds in Northern England. Yet they are accepted by the upper crust, having attracted the auspicious attention of the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret, Mrs. Nelson A. Rockefeller and Pre;ident Johnson, the latter through a statement by White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger. Nor is this all. The Beatles, in their personal appearances, sing and play but seldom can be heard above the shrieks of the audience, and so they almost play the role of mimes. In addition, Dr. Fox observes, the four are both an audience for their own antics and for those of their cavorting, screaming audience, acting, as it were, a play within a play. “There is a Chaplinesque quality to their style,” Dr. Fox said. “They convey the image of absurd little men in an absurd, big world, bewildered but bemused by it at the same time.” The Barnard social scientist observes that here, as in England, the appeal of the Beatles is not confined to girls in their teens and younger, but spreads to boys and to many adults of both sexes. She says she thinks that at least part of the attraction for adults lies in the Beatles's realistic attitudes toward their own success and their eventual eclipse. In the Beatles, Dr. Fox believes, people see four basically nice young boys who project some of the same contradictions that exist in many Americans, who are having a wonderful time at the acceptable expense of both themselves and their audiences, who have expressed their gratitude for this fling and who have promised a graceful adjustment to the time when the party will be over. It would seem, to paraphrase W. C. Fields, that someone who possesses all those qualities can't be all bad, no matter what some parents have been driven to think.

1473-> PRESIDENT FLIES OVER FLOOD AREA; PLEDGES U.S. AID; Views Devastation in Ohio Valley From Pittsburgh to the Mississippi
ERLANGER, Ky., March 13 —President Johnson flew 560 miles along the flooded Ohio River today, seeing whole towns under water and millions of dollars worth of property damage. With his Air Force jet dropping below 4,000 feet at some points, Mr. Johnson got a clear, at times shocking view of devastation in the Ohio Valley from Pennsylvania to the Mississippi. Later, in a brief stop at the Greater Cincinnati Airport here, across the Ohio from Cincinnati, Mr. Johnson ended his bumpy flight with a pledge that the Federal Government would do its “full share” to help the flood area. He said he had seen for himself “the ravages of the worst flood in this area in more than 20 years” and knew that the American people joined him in, “deepest condolences” to the homeless and those who had suffered loss. He has directed the Army Corps of Engineers to “accelerate action” in Ohio basin flood control, Mr. Johnson said. He promised that Federal funds would be made available for restoring roads, bridges and other facilities, and for loans to farmers, businessmen and homeowners. That meant the President planned to declare the Ohio Valley a disaster area as soon as the Governors of the affected states formally requested it and as soon as necessary legal requirements had been met. In the flight, the President, five Governors and a group of Federal officials observed the damage that the Ohio and its tributaries had done to one of the nation's greatest industrial complexes. Fed by early thaws and heavy rains, rivers such as the Muskingum, the Hocking, the Scioto, the Big and Little Miamis, the Salt, the Whitewater and the Licking have run far over their banks and deposited their muddy waters in the Ohio. That major river, running along the borders of West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois, crested at 66 feet yesterday and 65.5 at noon today at Cincinnati. It was even higher farther downstream. Mr. Johnson left Washington about 1:30 P.M. and flew to Pittsburgh. There he landed briefly and was joined by Govs. Edward T. Breathitt of Kentucky, James A. Rhodes of Ohio, W. W. Barron of West Virginia, Matthew E. Welsh of Indiana and Otto Kerner of Illinois. Gov. William W. Scranton of Pennsylvania was represented by Maurice. Goddard, the state's Director of Forests and Waters. Also in the President's party were Edward A. McDermott, the director of the Office of Emergency Planning; Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman; Lieut. Gen. Walter K. Wilson Jr., chief of the Army Corps Engineers, and Gen. Alfred M. Gruenther, president of the Ainerican Red Cross. Gov. John M. Dalton of Missouri was unable to make the flight with the President, but he joined the party briefly at the stop here. With the other Governors, he was informed of the Federal assistance that could be made available and of the procedures for requesting that parts of his state be declared a disaster area. The flood is reported by the Red Cross to have left more than 30,000 families homeless in 109 counties. Mr. Johnson said that the Red Cross alone fed more than 15,000 persons inwthe area last night. From Pittsburgh, where most of the gubernatorial party boarded his plane at the Greater Pittsburgh Airport, Mr. Johnson's red, white and blue jet flew at 350 miles an hour down the Ohio Valley. Its altitude usually varied from 6,000 to 4,000 feet and it occasionally dropped to about 3,500. A military version of the Boeing 707, it usually cruises at about 30,000 feet. At the low altitude at which it flew today, the air was extremely turbulent, making the plane bounce so badly that it was usually not possible to walk in the aisles. At about 2:40 P.M. the President saw the first evidences of the flood as his plane circled above Wheeling, W. Va. The crest passed this area several days ago and the river was only slightly beyond its banks. The great industrial plants of the city seemed to be fully at work and the smoke from their tall stacks cast a blue haze over the Ohio. As the Presidential plane flew downriver, extensive flooding on tributary rivers and creeks could be seen. At New Martinsburg, V. Va., water was standing in the streets. The banks of the river were outlined only by tree trunks rising above the muddy water, which spread far beyond the banks. Where the Muskingum enters the Ohio at Marietta, there was extensive flooding, putting nearly the whole town under water. Parkersburg, W. Va., appeared to be as hard hit. At some points, the tributaries were flooding so badly that they were wider than the Ohio itself. Mr. Johnson's plans flew away from the Ohio at times. It passed above Athens, seat of Ohio University, on the Hocking River. The university football stadium and part of the city airport were inundated. The flood crest passed Cineinnati yesterday and was near Louisville today. At Cincinnati, however, the Big and Little Miami Rivers were pouring into the Ohio, as was the Licking from the Kentucky side. The whole city seemed to be surrounded by brown water. A power plant at Lawrenceburg, Ind., appeared to stand alone in the middle of the Ohio River. its stack belching smoke. At West Point, Ky., the Salt River had flooded all the town's streets. Louisville's riverfront was under water and one of the city's suburban subdivisions was almost covered. That was the situation all down the river. Mr. Johnson flew to Mt. Cannel, Ill., just above the confluence of the Ohio and the Mississippi Rivers. Then his plane turned around and he returned here. At the airport here, a crowd of, several hundred persons stood on the observation deck to cheer Mr. Johnson and the governors as they gathered around a makeshift lectern. The President said he hoped hig inspection tour would “expedite assistance that is needed.” He pledged that no time would be lost in easing “the hardship and the trial” of the flood. He also pointed out that about $750 million had been invested by the Federal Government in Ohio River flood control. The resulting facilities saved property worth more than $1 billion, he said. The President also told the small audience that the largest single recommendation in his flood control budget for the fiscal year 1965 was for the Ohio — about $225 million. After his talk, Mr. Johnson toured the airport buildings and returned to Washington. Ohio River Cities Awash After Worst Flood in Years

1474-> PRESIDENT GREETS WIFE AND TRUMAN
WASHINGTON, March 13 (AP)—Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson and former President Harry S. Truman returned tonight from Athens, where they attended the funeral of King Paul as official representatives of President Johnson. The President welcomed his wife and Mr. Truman when their plane came in at Andrews Air Force Base, near Washington, soon after Mr. Johnson had returned from his Ohio Va1ley flight. On his visit to Athens, Mr. Truman said, he had seen for the first time a controversial statue the Greeks erected in his honor. It is inscribed with words from the Truman Doctrine of 1947, which provided for United States aid to Greece and Turkey against the Communist threats in that region after World War II.

1476-> PRESIDENT LAUDS CONGRESS RECORD; Bids Party Unite in Address at Fund‐Raising Dinner
WASHINGTON, March 19— President Johnson, in a rousing partisan speech, enlivened an otherwise lethargic Democratic fund‐raising dinner here tonight. any war, and I hope we are wise enough not to have to fight one.” To some 5,300 party faithful gathered for a $100‐a‐plate dinner in the National Guard Armory, the President called on all Democrats and all who believe as Democrats to unite for an electoral victory in 1964. Mr. Johnson was lavish in his praise of the 88th Congress. The American economy, the President said, is stronger tonight “than it has ever been in vour lifetime.” “Our military power has never been greater,” he said. “We are strong enough to win any war, and I hope we are wise enough not to have to fight one.” His Administration, with the help of Congress, the President said, “has declared war on poverty and will accept nothing less than total victory.” Reciting other accomplishments of the current Congress, the President invoked the memory of Franklin D. Roosevelt when he said: “The real fight before the United States is for all our people to lead happier lives. We can look forward to a better deal. This always has been the aim of the Democratic party.” The President received a thunderous ovation as he and Mrs. Johnson entered the huge armory shortly before 8 o'clock. Shamrock green was the decorative motif of the evening, with Cellophane festoons draped from the ceiling, clusters of hundreds of green and white balloons, and giant Democratic donkeys rampant in circles of green tinsel. The occasion was the first major money‐raising event of election year 1964. As toastmaster, the Democrats brought out their most famous strategist, James A. Farley. As the man who masterminded Franklin D. Roosevelt's first two elections, and brought the Democrats to a dominance in Congress that has been interrupted only briefly in the last 30 years, Mr. Farley enjoys a reverence in Democratic circles matched by few men in history. Also present at the head table and seated near the President was Adlai E. Stevenson, Chief United States Delegate to the United Nations, who was the Democratic nominee in two hopeless campaigns against Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956. Former President Harry S. Truman, who was scheduled to be present, sent a telegram of greeting from Key West, Fla., where he is vacationing. ’ The President was in good form as he took the lectern tonight. Speaking in firm, vigorous tones, with more of the familiar Senatorial fire than has been heard in most of his speeches from the White House, the President infused life into a gathering that had been more lethargic than lively during most of the evening. He opened his talk with a tribute to President Kennedy, saying: “The valiant man who should have been here tonight would be the first to enjoy this occasion, an act of senseless terror took John Kennedy from us, but the system of government that he believed in and that he fought for and that he died for Drevailed. “That the country goes on, that the system is unshaken, only proves the rightness of the cause that he led and the cause that you support.” The head table was dominated by the senior chairmen of the committees of the House and Senate. Though many of them, like Senator Richard B. Russell of Georgia, and Representative Howard W. Smith of Virginia. have opposed him on civil rights and other measures, the President was unstinting in his praise of their leadership. “Thanks to the men at this head table,” he said, “this Congress is the greatest education Congress in the history of the republic. “This Congress has done more for the common defense of freedom and is well on its way to doing more than any other for the rights of all of our citizens.” “This Congress,” the President said, “has the opportunity to reverse the upward trend of Government spending. This Congress has done more than any other Congress to protect the life of our nation. Here and around the world. We will pursue the cause of social justice.” Mr. Johnson said that, while he had come chiefly to salute his fellow Democrats, he saluted with equal sincerity, “those members of the Republican minority who are courageously supporting programs for a better America.” “It say this because I have always believed that Democrats could be partisan without being blind,” he said. This comment seemed to be addressed to those Republicans in the House and the Senate who have stoutly supported his civil rights bill.

1477-> DOUBLE OVERTIME OPPOSED BY A.T.&T.
WASHINGTON, March 16 (AP)—The American Telephone and Telegraph Company opposed today an Administration bill to provide double pay for overtime in some industries. The bill Was sent to Congress as a proposal to fight unemployment, but R. A. Goodson, vice president of A.T. &T., testified that it would not do the job. “Imposing penalty rates of double time for overtime would not result in added people on our payroll,” Mr. Goodson told a House subcommittee on labor, “because these additional people would be surplus much of the time.” He aaid that “wide fluctua‐ tions in the work load in the telephone business make overtime unavoidable because we have found no other way of furnishing service the public wants on a 24‐hour‐day, 7‐days‐a‐week basis. at reasonable cost.” Mr. Goodson also testified that if the bill applied to the telephone industry it would add $68 million to the company's costs each year. Opposition to the bill also came from Western Electric Company, a subsidiary of A.T. & T. Harvey G. Mehlhouse, vice president of Western Electric, said that the bill “would not increase employment.” “It would only add to cost,” he maintained.

1478-> Kotlarek Outjumps Zandanel
Mich., March 1 (AP)—Gene Kotlarek of Duluth, Minn., outleaped Nilo Zandanel of Cortina, Italy, today to win the national Kiwanis ski‐jumping championship on Giant Pine Mountain. A crowd estimated at more than 20,000 showed up in 50degree weather to watch the 26‐year‐old Zandanel attempt to set an American distance record. He had sailed 472 feet for a world mark two weeks ago at Oderstdorf, Germany, and was brought here to try to break Kotlarek's American record of 322 feet. The Pine Mountain hill record of 317 feet was not even ap‐ proached as the sun blazed down and started melting the packed snow slide of the towering scaffOld, slowing the take‐off speeds. Despite the continuous doctoring of the chute with moisture‐absorbing chemicals, not even a 300-foot jump was recorded. Kotlarek won with leaps of 298 and 294 feet. The 5‐foot‐6inch Zandanel appeared to have missed his timing in take ‐off and the best he couId do in three attempts were 284 and 288 feet.

1480-> Chamber in Capital Is Warmer To Rockefeller Than Goldwater
WASHINGTON, Feb.6 —Governor Rockefeller combined praise for the free enterprise system and concern over civil rights with a little informal primary campaigning today. On a flying visit to the capital on his way to Oregon, Mr. Rockefeller spoke to a conference of the United States Chamber of Commerce and opened a political headquarters for a primary he has not announced he will enter. At the Chamber luncheon, the Governor urged 750 businessmen not to “use our conservative principles of business as an' excuse not to solve the social problems that confront the nati.” Unlike Senator Barry Goldwater, who told the same group yesterday that government should leave business alone altogether, Mr. Rockefeller said it was “the respopsibility of government to create a framework of laws for the growth of the free enterprise system.” The Governor received a measurably warmer reception from the business group than hadSenator Goldwater. His speech was interrupted 10 times by applause to one for Mr. Goldwater's yesterday. Comments in the lobby afterward were generally more favorable. In a reference to the con servative views of his opponent for the Republican Presidential nomination, Mr. Rockefeller criticized politicians who “would like to go back to ‘the good old days' and “emphasize nostalgia for a glamorized version of the past.” “There isn't much of a business market today for buggywhips and high button shoes,” the Governor declared, “nor is there any place in today's America for turning back the clock on social progress.” After the luncheon, Mr. Rockefeller presided at ceremonies opening his Washington headquarters, a 10—room suite of second‐floor offices just across Connecticut Avenue from the Goldwater for President headquarters. There he spoke to several hundred District of Columbia Republicans, including a number of local Negro leaders. He emphasized the necessity of making sure that “the doors of the Republican party are always open to all Americans.” Mr. Rockefeller has not yet announced that he will enter the primary May 5 in the District of Columbia, but he sounded today like an active candidate. He praised the Republicans on hand for “the courage to take a position in a primary” and promised that “I'm in there pitching, coming from behind but going all the way.” The Rockefeller headquarters here bears a huge, internally lighted picture of the Governor, facing down Connecticut Avenue toward the White House. It has a jaundiced yellow complexion by day, but a healthy Florida tan by night.

1483-> A Reader's Report
DAVID WALKER, who can write a straight suspense novel with the best of them, has stitched together, in WINTER OF MADNESS (Houghton, Mifflin, $3.95), a crazy quilt of a thriller. Assembled on the pheasant‐laden acres of Tarquin, the 13th baron Duncatto, are as promising a collection of troublemakers as can be found in the no man's land between science‐fiction and the whodunit: Harry Z. Gilpin, a millionaire mystery man in search of an unusual answer to high labor costs. (I can't tell you what this is — but Mary Shelley and Karel Capek may give you a clue.) Bud Gravel and Mabel Boulding, a pair of young Dr. Frankensteins. Theodore, a youth who realizes in one repulsive package all of the aspirations that Charles Addams holds dear. Tiger Clyde, a“giant cad” and Walker's answer to James Bond. And Caesar Campari, a sideburned enigma who seems to have every normal human quality, and a few inhuman ones for good measure. Turn these creatures loose on the Scottish moors and you are in for some exotic foolishness: Tarquin almost goes off the deep end; Theodore keeps trying to shorten the guest list; Clyde and his portable land mines arrive late for every big do; the bottomless Muckle Bog receives more than one corpse; and the reader is generously entertained. “I admit he seems to be a very nice young man,” says Duncan Blake about his new son‐in‐law in Willard Temple's  (Crown, $3.95). “He certainly has a lot more poise and confidence than I had at his age. In fact I suspect he has more poise and confidence than I have now. There's just one more thing I wish he had. I wish he had a job.” This is only one of the anxieties Duncan has about his son‐in‐law's future. It seems a reasonable one—since the groom goes from unemployment . to selling swimming pools, to bank clerking, to unemployment, before the first wedding anniversary. As the plot develops, however, the older generation is looking only at surface characteristics that hide the sturdy mettle out of which the middle class is made. Mr. Temple's account of the clash between parents and married offspring is in the category of family humor, but it is given a surprisingly sharp focus by the author's wit and sympathy. Duncan Blake, who turns into a fortyish grandfather before your very eyes, is branch manager of a brokerage house in a Yankee town, and, what is more, he likes it: the modest success, the hopes for success less modest, the pleasures and pains of being a parent. Mr. Temple's skill at getting under his hero's skin creates a believable basis for good‐humored farce. The locale of Lin Tai‐yi's (World, $5.95) is Hong Kong. The climate is pure Dickens—though no Dickensian benefactor turns up providentially to rescue the Taoi family from their degradation. Lam, his sister Riri and his mother Eling live on Kampoon Street, in a warren where the room dividers are made of wire netting and it is a quarter‐mile walk to the nearest water tap. Along with other millions, they are down on their luck, and try to scrape along as best they can. Thirteen‐yearold Lam leaves school and gets a job in a sharks'‐fin plant, where his cousin already works, “paddling about in his bare feet in puddles of warm water amid the boiling caidrons and sulphur fumes” Eling moonshines medicinal rice wine from a family recipe and peddles it with indifferent success. Riri gets a job in the Paradise Hotel Beauty Shop—through which, in a roundabout way, she meets playboy Sunny Tung. Sunny is a nasty job of work; Riri is innocent and desperate, and the result of their liaison is an old, old story, which Mrs. Lin does not tell especially well. What she does effectively is to communicate a glimmering of what it must be like to exist on Kampoon Street. In (Farrar, Straus, $4.50), H. E. Bates continues the adventures of the Larkins, a family that stays together through free love. The ringleader of this happy breed is a senior citizen named Syd Larkin, who mingles a loyalty to the past (he is a junk dealer) with a zest for contemporary phenomena like a swimming pool, nudism, fancy mixed drinks and girls. Syd is generous, warm‐hearted and venturesome, and is dedicated to spreading his personal gospel that sex can be fun. In their pursuit of the good life, the Larkins have neglected not only the marriage vows, but also baptismal rites—an omission which is corrected in a multiple ceremony that is seven up on “Life With Father.” I don't think that Mr. Bates's current will attract the notice of the Nobel Prize Committee, but it should do fine in the circulating libraries.

1486-> FARM PRODUCTS ADVANCE IN PRICE; 2.5% Increase Is Reported by Agency for Month
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 (AP) — The Agriculture Department reported today that farm product prices increased 2.5 per cent during the month ended Jan. 15. Higher prices for cattle, hogs and eggs contributed most to the increase. Partly offsetting this were seasonally lower prices for cotton and milk. The department said the Jan. 15 farm price level was 1 per cent below a year ago. Prices paid by farmers, including interest, taxes and farm wage rates, rose two‐thirds of 1 per cent between mid‐December and mid‐January. Primarily responsible for this increase were a sharp upturn in prices of feeder cattle and a rise in tax and interest rates. The price level paid by farmers equaled the record set last July, and was 1 per cent above a year earlier. The department said farm prices as a whole in mid‐December averaged 78 per cent of the parity price goal of Federal farm programs, compared with 76 per cent in mid‐December, 79 per cent a year ago, and the record of 123 per cent set in October, 1946. Prices received by farmers in mid‐January averaged 243 per cent of the 1910–14 base, compared with 237 per cent in mid‐December, 245 per cent a year ago, and the record of 313 per cent set in February, 1951. Prices paid by farmers in mid‐January were 313 per cent of the 1910–14 base average, compared with 311 per cent in mid‐December, and 312 per cent a year ago.

1487-> Anti­Drug Drive Ordered In Italian Soccer League
MILAN, Italy, March 25 (AP) —The Italian Soccer League last night announced a campaign aimed at keeping major league players from using pep pills before championship games. The decision came in the wake of a drugging scandal that rocked Italian soccer. Traces of an illegal stimulant were found in the urine of five Bologna players during a routine spot check after a February game. The players were acquitted by the judiciary commission of the league. The team's coach was disqualified until Sept. 21, 1965.

1488-> FAURE & FAIRCLOUGH FORMS NEW CONCERN
LONDON, Feb. 6—H. M. F. Faure & Fairclough, an old established house which was caught in the backwash of the New Jersey vegetable‐oil scandal, announced today it was forming a new company in which the big Netherlands trading group, Internatio, will have a minority holding. The shell of the old company will be left to deal with claims against the Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Company, now in bankruptcy. It is not known whether Faure & Fairclough will be liquidated. The new company, to be known as Faure Fairclough, will resume the busniess of dealing in copra, groundnuts and vegetable oils. It does not expect any retrenchment of its business, although its scope may be reduced as a result of its experiences with Allied Crude.

1490-> BUILDING PERMITS UP IN NOVEMBER; Dollar Value Gains Over '62 Month—Off From October
The dollar value of building permits issued in the country's largest cities in November was 7.8 per cent higher than in November, 1962, but 26.1 per cent below the value of those issued last October, according to a report by Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. The dollar value of the permits last November was $624 million. Permits issued for new construction in this city in November had a total value of $44 million, a decline of 41.7 per cent from October. The value of permits in Manhattan, where most of the city's building projects are concentrated, was estimated at $24.2 million in November, compared with $56.3 million in October. The Dun & Bradstreet report covers 200 cities. In the 199 other cities the total value of permits dropped 24.6 per cent in November from October's total. The dollar value last November was estimated at $579 million, 4.1 per cent above November, 1962. There was a decline in building permits in the largest 25 cities in November. The biggest was in Chicago, where the dollar value dropped from $48 million in October to $14.4 million in November. Despite the general decline, some large cities, such as Atlanta, Baltimore, Cleveland, Detroit and Memphis, issued permits in November that had a greater dollar value than in October. The total value of permits issued in the 200 cities from January to November in 1963 was $8.5 billion, 12.6 per cent above the value of the permits issued in those cities in the same months of 1962.

1491-> Bulganin Returns To the Soviet Scene At New Year Party
MOSCOW, Wednesday, Jan.1 —Marshal Nikolai A. Bulganin, former Soviet Premier, made his first public appearance in several years in the company of Premier Khrushchev at the night's New Year's party in the Kremlin. The 68‐year‐old Marshal Bulganin, who was dropped from the Soviet leadership in 1958 because of his support of the so‐called anti‐party group of Mr. Khrushchev's opponents, sat at one of about 100 tables in the huge banquet hall of the modernistic Palace of Congresses. After the dinner, when about 2,000 guests moved to the adjoining St. George's Hall of the Great Kremlin Palace for dancing, Marshal Bulganin and his wife joined Mr. and Mrs. Khrushchev and President and Mrs. Leonid I. Brezhnev for the rest of the festivities. Kozlov Still Absent Marshal Bulganin was an unexpected guest at the party, at which Premier Khrushchev, in a jovial mood proposed toast after toast, especially to peace in 1964, in traditional Soviet fashion. Mikhail A. Suslov, a member of the Communist party's Presidium, who had been absent from public functions because of illness for the last few months, also made an appearance at the celebration. The only member of the leadership absent was Frol R. Kozlov, who has been partly paralyzed and inactive since last summer. Mr. Khrushchev seemed in one of his more optimistic moods. His toasts lacked the aggressive tone and bite they had a year ago when the Cuban missile crisis and the Berlin dispute were dominant themes of his remarks. As the Premier rambled from one subject to another, he spoke of a recent letter from Roswell Garst, the Iowa corngrower whom Mr. Khrushchev met on his trip to the United States in 1959. Mr. Khrushchev said the letter assured him that the Soviet Union would make progress in its lagging agriculture now that the Russians had embarked upon an expansion of the fertilizer industry. In hailing the Soviet Communist party, Mr. Khrushchev said it had been able throughout its history to resist “deviationists, Trotskyists, etcetera.” He added: “And you know whom I mean by etcetera, etcetera.” Listeners assumed he was alluding to the anti‐party group that tried to seize power from him in 1957. In a toast to the Soviet armed forces, the Premier exprssed his opposition to war but said, “We will fight as never before if war is forced on us.” As he was toasting the developing countries of Asia and Africa, Mr. Khrushchev reiterated past Soviet condemnation of a recent Ghanaian student demonstration in Red Square over the disputed circumstances of the death of a fellow student. “At home they can do anything they like,” he said, “even stand on their heads. But they have to come to the Soviet Union as guests and here we do not allow such things.” Marshal Bulganin's return to the public scene was interpreted as sign of Mr. Khrushchev's tolerance toward his former opponents rather than an indication that the former Premier would once again assume high position. The friendly chatting between the two men was regarded as evidence only of their personal relationship. Mr. Khrushchev's attitude toward Marshal Bulganin recalled the treatment of Marshal Kliment Y. Voroshilov, the former President, who was dropped from the leadership for supporting the anti‐party group but who was again permitted to circulate among Presidium members at social functions. Marshal Bulganin was Premier from February, 1955, when he succeeded Georgi M. Malenkov, to March, 1958. The marshal was then gradually eased out of the Soviet hierarchy by serving briefly as chairman of the Soviet State Bank and then as the head of a regional industrial management council in the Northern Caucasus. Former Premier Bulganin's appearance at the Kremlin New Year's reception adds a new note of mystery to the tangled politics of the Soviet hierarchy. Until his reappearance, Marshal Bulganin's continued existence even was uncertain in the West. He had not been seen for several years by Western observers and there had been earlier reports that he was extremely ill after having been relieved from his last known position, a minor post in the Soviet provinces. The so‐called anti‐party group attempted to purge Mr. Khrushchev from his post as First Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party in June, 1957. Mr. Khrushchev defeated that effort and, although he permitted Mr. Bulganin to remain as Premier until the late winter of 1958, he finally sent the Marshal tumbling down the ranks of Soviet officialdom to obscurity. Mr. Bulganin's return to the Soviet scene raises the possibility that other members of the anti‐party group may also reappear. The most important of these are Vyacheslav M. Molotov, former Premier and Foreign Minister and former Premier Malenkov. When last heard from Mr. Molotov was living a quiet life as a retired citizen in Moscow and Mr. Malenkov was the manager of a power station in Kazakhstan. One possibility suggested by Mr. Bulganin's reappearance is that of a new shift of power in the Kremlin hierarchy. Western observers have noted that since late last October a dramatic change has taken place in the Soviet Communist party line toward Communist China. From bitter hostility and open political ideological warfare, the Soviet line has seemed to undergo a transformation to a current appeal to Peking for a truce.

1493-> Houk, With 8 Yankees Unsigned, Finds ‘Boss’ Has Some Problems
HOLLYWOOD, Fla., Feb. 21 —Ralph Houk isn't exactly worrying—yet. However, there is no denying that the onetime Yankee manager, now making his debut as the general manager, could be heading for his first serious problems. When the major took over as Roy Hamey's successor, his first important job was signing the players to their 1964 contracts. Inasmuch as all his previous years in the Yankee organization had concerned themselves with activities on the field, first as player, then as coach and finally as manager, this task of adjusting salary differences was something brand new for him. However, he didn't think it would be a difficult one, especially after he had induced Roger Maris, always a bit stubborn in previous years, to accept a cut from $72,000 to $60,000. Yogi Berra was adequately taken care of by being named manager, and the pitching ace, Whitey Ford, received a pay raise with the understanding he would work it off by doubling as pitching coach. But as Houk checked on the situation today, he found he still had eight players of more or less importance whose autographs he had yet to obtain. One of these, of course, doesn't figure to be a problem. That would be Mickey Mantle, whose contract signing is understood merely to await his arrival in camp. It can be accepted that Mickey again will receive $100,000 and that the actual signing, amid the usual fanfare, will take place the latter part of next week when the Yanks shift from their preliminary rookie camp here to the regular training base in Fort Lauderdale. However, there is nothing certain about the other seven. In this group are Jim Bouton, Hal Reniff and Steve Hamilton, pitchers; Elston Howard and John Blanchard, catchers; Phil Linz, utility infielder, and Tom Tresh, the regular left fielder. No player is considered a holdout until he fails to report on the date assigned for training. This means that the three pitchers and two catchers have until next Thursday to come to terms. That is the day the Yankee battery men are to report. Tresh and Linz are not due in camp until March 4. Actually, only two in this group are being taken seriously. They are Bouton and Howard. They could be difficult, especially young Bouton. There is no denying the young righthander had a tremendous season last year. After a fairish freshman year in '62, Bouton is understood to have received $12,000 last year. Starting as a relief hurler last spring, Bouton was promoted to the regular rotation in May. He wound up with a dazzling 21‐7 won‐lost record and a 2.53 earned‐run average. For this he is understood to be asking double his 1963 salary. However, raising a 25‐year‐old . hurler $12,000 is quite a jump as ball clubs figure it. Howard has perhaps an even greater sales pitch. Not only was Howie the season's outstanding catcher but, with Man‐tle and Maris incapacitated during long stretches, he was the bulwark of the Yankee attack. He won the league's most valuable player award and for this the 34‐year‐old receiver would like to see his pay jacked up to an even $50,000. It may take some of Houk's most persuasive talk to solve these two problems.
