206-> IN THE PARIS CINEMAS; ' La Croisiere Jaune,' a Record of a Great Motor Journey -- 'Fedora'
A PICTURE "with a difference" is playing in Paris now, and winning a deserved success. It is what the French call a "documentaire" — a documentary film as distinguished from a fictional once. André Citroën, the French Henry Ford, furnished the inspiration and the money for the expedition, while the late and regretted explorer, Georges-Marie Haardt, was its tragic hero."La Croisière Jaune" ("The Yellow Journey") is the record of an astonishing motor trip from Beirut, Syria, across Afghanistan, the Himalaya Mountains, the Gobi Desert and the rest of Asia to Peiping. Out of some 50,000 feet of film taken under the expert direction of André Sauvage, a mere 2,500 have been selected from among the high spots, but there are naturally more than enough thrilling and beautiful passages left to make a number of other films.An Exciting Episode.The picture is certainly a classic of its type from any point of view. Readers of THE NEW YORK TIMES will perhaps remember following briefly the itinerary of the two heroic little groups who drove in automobiles along the fabled route where six centuries ago Marco Polo crept along by foot and caravan. The main group started from Beirut going east, while a smaller group worked westward from Peiping, later falling into the hands of the war lord of Sinkiang, who commandeered the autos and imprisoned the men. One of the many thrilling episodes of "La Croisière Jaune" is furnished by the sudden loss of contact between the two groups, which had been keeping in touch with each other by wireless, and the ultimate happy junction in Urumsti, the capital of Sinkiang Province.Most of the film is taken up by the first group, which Haardt led. The hardships they endured are only briefly suggested, and are even made light of, but they become all the more vivid through being imagined rather than seen. They built their own roads, plowed through streams, crept along narrow precipices where every so often the outer wheels would slip over and the car would perch at a perilous angle over dizzy space. More than once the cars had to be taken apart completely, carried over rivers with native help and reassembled. Through sandstorms and snowstorms, the baking heat of the desert and the bitter cold of the mountain passes, they carried on steadily and successfully. We get fascinating and too tantalizingly brief glimpses of strange people and their strange customs, of curious and beautiful works of art, and of even more beautiful natural scenery.20,000 Miles Covered.In all, nearly 20,000 miles were covered in this astonishing trip, which not only made a great contribution to the history of motor transport but also to ethnological research. Its success makes all the more tragic the untimely death of the expedition's leader, Georges-Marie Haardt, who fell victim to pneumonia on board ship returning to France. For M. Citroën the triumph was no less great. The cars were his, and much of the preliminary planning, as well as the financing. It is the third notable expedition of the sort which he has sponsored, and pictorially it is certainly the greatest. The first was in 1923, when a Citroën caravan made the first crossing of the Sahara. Then came "La Croisière Noire"—the remarkable trip across the continent of Africa through the equatorial forest. Like the other two, "La Croisière Jaune" will be seen in the United States.To go from one extreme to another, let us take a cab down the Champs-Elysées from the theatre of that name where "La Croisière Jaune" is playing, to the Paramount on the Boulevard des Italiens, just off the Opéra. On that same corner forty-two years ago "tout Paris" arrived in carriages for the opening night at the Théâtre du Vaudeville. The play was Victorien Sardou's "Fédora," written for that well-known actress, Sarah Bernhardt, supported by the distinguished comédien, Pierre Berton. It was a historic night for the Parisian theatre of that generation. Paris was taken by storm. "La divine Sarah" never had such a triumph. Audiences that a World War had not made jaded, cynical or sophisticated thrilled to the florid emotionalism of what was then called "du sang, de la volupté et de la mort."And now we have "Fédora" back again, in a different medium, postdated to 1911, and with a new cast, but still undisgulsedly and unashamedly Victorien Sardou and "old-fashioned." The critics are treating it more as a musty antique than a living drama, but audiences seem to like it—even blasé Parisian audiences—and when it reaches the provinces, which were never anything but "old-fashioned" in such matters, it should be in its element.The film resurrects for us the atmosphere of the Czar's court with its amorous and political intrigues, its Nihilists and lovely dancers and equally lovely princesses. Prince Vladimir Yarichkine, son of the police chief of all Russia, is mysteriously assassinated. Nihilists are suspected of the crime; his fiancée, Princess Fédora, vows vengeance. She suspects Count Ipanoff, who flees to Paris immediately after the murder, and she follows him. There she contrives to make this acquaintance; vamps him (to use a word which hadn't been invented at the time) and, needless to say, falls deeply in love with him herself.A Tragic Ending.However, on learning from his own lips that he was the assassin, she does her duty, and denounces him. Shortly afterward, just before he is about to be arrested, he explains to her why he killed Yarichkine. It was after learning that the prince was the lover of his wife, and on finding them together at a rendezvous, that he shot the man. Fédora, realizing that her fiancé had betrayed her too, immediately repents of her rash denunciation, and she and Ipanoff flee from the Russian agents. A brief and happy honeymoon ends tragically when Ipanoff learns that his mother, brother and closest friend have been murdered in Russia by Yarichkine's father after the receipt of Fédora's letter. He soon discovers who has denounced them. His love turns momentarily to hatred, and Fédora kills herself.This is good, florid melodrama, and in the hands of an excellent cast manages to be unfailingly interesting and at times thrilling. Marie Bell acquits herself very creditably indeed in the ungrateful task of recreating Sarah Bernhardt's rôle of Fédora. Ernest Ferny does beautiful work as Ipanoff.While on the subject of contrasts, a third film now showing in Paris is well deserving of mention. It is a particularly typical French production in which army life is turned to spice and humor—"La Garnison Amoureuse" ("The Garrison in Love"). This is a farce comedy of the broadest style, and in the best tradition of the French theatre, both for amusement and daring. The spice is in the words rather than the situations, and it would be a carping critic indeed who could take offense at so witty a dialogue."La Garnison Amoureuse."The story is about a garrison with a well-earned reputation for amorousness. A new colonel comes to take charge, and is duly scandalized. The officers, as he sees it, are being led astray by a beautiful and rich young American girl, while the men carry on with less elegant fare. He visits the girl to ask her to take her charms elsewhere and, of course, becomes a victim himself. Being refused favors which his subordinates are granted, he confines the entire garrison to quarters indefinitely. Three privates, around whom much of the fun centres, manage by different ruses to get out each night, which makes them much in demand, and the handsome one of the trio, in fact, wins the favor of the American. The village, however, is bitterly dissatisfied; the women are lonely, and the men have lost their business. A delegation appeals to the American beauty, who in turn inveigles the regional general to order the garrison's release.It is a slender and doubtless ridiculous plot, but the fun is in the acting rather than in the story. Betty Stockfield, an English girl who is to be seen in many French films, does a gorgeously amusing and seductive job as the American girl. Lucien Baroux is perfect, as always, in the rôle of the colonel, while Fernandel, Raymond Cordy and Pierre Brasseur are screamingly funny as the three privates.The picture is interesting, too, for belonging to a very definite type. There are hundreds of plays and novels and dozens of films on the same subject, with the changes rung on every possible variation. If "Fédora" can be called "bien Russe," "La Garnison Amoureuse" is certainly "bien Français"—just as French as it could be.

387-> THE SCREEN; Margaret Sullavan and Douglass Montgomery in Film of "Little Man, What Now?"
By his genuinely fine pictorial transcription of Hans Fallada's novel "Little Man, What Now?" which came to the Radio City Music Hall yesterday, Frank Borzage, who has been none too fortunate in the selection of his recent stories, strikes his old stride as a director. Here is a film with settings that are impressive by their modesty; in fact the German atmosphere is always convincing and therefore emphatically helpful to the story. The numerous characters are drawn expertly, both through acting and make-up, and the narrative adheres quite closely to the author's work.Considering that there are more than twenty-four players in the cast, Mr. Borzage had a difficult task, but he has accomplished it in a masterly fashion. The continuity is pleasingly smooth and throughout the many scenes the remarkable attention to detail is striking. The tale is sentimental often woebegone, but it is set forth with the necessary touch of truth.Margaret Sullavan acts Lammchen, as the girl is affectionately known by her young husband, Hans Pinneberg, played by Douglass Montgomery. The tale tells of their vicissitudes, beginning immediately after they are wed. Lammchen and Hans return to Ducherow, where Hans is employed as a bookkeeper by a merchant named Emil Kleinholz, and the bride wonders at her husband's nervousness and obvious desire to conceal her. Later she learns that Hans does not want Kleinholz to know that he is married, fearing that his employer might discharge him.De Witt Jannings, who has invariably been seen hitherto as a police captain or a detective, portrays Kleinholz, and his acting is one of the picture's many strong points. Kleinholz has no pity in his soul and he delights in threatening his employes with dismissal.Subsequently the scene changes to Berlin, whither Hans and Lammchen go to dwell with the former's worldly stepmother, Mia Pinneberg. Her lover is a generous scoundrel named Jachman, who somehow or other succeeds in getting the anxious Hans employment in Mandel's store. By that time Hans is aware that his wife is about to become a mother and he worries over his job, for he realizes that his sales are by no means satisfactory.Mia Pinnberg's wild entourage eventually causes Hans and Lammchen to leave. Where will they go? The question is solved by a splendid old wagon driver named Puttbreese, who has a loft to rent over his second-hand furniture store. Puttbreese is played most ably by Christian Rub, who even in the doleful episodes lends a glimpse of real cheer. It is here that Lammchen's boy is born—he it is to whom the words are addressed by his father, "Little Man, What Now?" The infant, however, inspires courage and joy in the hearts of the young couple and, after Hans has a dangerous experience, the sun shines in the lives of the young father, Lammchen and "Little Man, What Now?"Miss Sullavan gives a charming and thoroughly believable personation. Mr. Montgomery is the personification of sincerity. Alan Hale makes an ingratiating scamp of Jachman and Catherine Doucet does well as Mia Pinneberg. Alan Mowbray affords some mild fun as a conceited motion-picture actor. Among others who distinguish themselves are Fred Kohler, Muriel Kirkland, Monroe Owsley, G. P. Huntley Jr., Etienne Girardot and Paul Fix.Russell Markert's production, "Fiesta Mexicana," is the stage attraction. Those who figure in it include M. Vodnoy, Thalia Zanou and Asya Kaz, the ballet corps; Evelyn Duerler, Howard Phillips, the Mexican A. B. C. Trio and the Rockettes. LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW? adapted from Hans Fallada's novel; directed by Frank Borzage; a Universal production. At the Radio City Music Hall.Lammchen Pinneberg . . . . .

432-> The Joseph Bill.
The passage of the Joseph bill by the New York Senate and the passage of a similar bill by at least one house of the New Jersey Legislature, practically forbidding criticism of racial or religious groups, are rather extreme exemplifications of that popular legislative method which rushes bad bills through by attaching misleading labels to them.

453-> THE SCREEN
In spite of its name, "Wie Sag' Ich's Meinen Mann?" ("How Shall I Tell My Husband?"), the new German-language film at the Seventy-ninth Street Theatre, is just a routine matrimonial comedy, in which there is nothing likely to startle the spectators.Renate Müller is charming as the young wife whose selfish husband's unfounded suspicions redound to her spritual benefit in the end, and Georg Alexander does his usual good work in the rôle of the petty tyrant finally tamed through fear of losing his awakened spouse. Ida Wüst makes something worth while of the "independent" family friend, and Otto Wallburg babbles through a comparatively minor part in a rather entertaning way. But, taken altogether, not much interest is to be found in the unimaginative development of the hackneyed theme.The photography is excellent and Renate Müller has occasion to wear a variety of costumes with her accustomed grace. A Comedy in German. WIE SAG' ICH'S MEINEM MANN?

It would be vain, even for those who look most hopefully to Roosevelt, to deny the faults and weaknesses that have developed in the national recovery program and to which Darrow directs attention.

471-> THE SCREEN; Constance Bennett, Franchot Tone, Helen Westley and Tullio Carminati in a Musical Film.
In "Moulin Rouge," a musical film which reached the Rivoli yesterday, Constance Bennett is kept very much on the alert, for she not only plays a dual rôle, but for several scenes she appears as a brunette. As for the story, which is somewhat reminiscent of that of "The Guardsman," with a reversed angle, it is of the back-stage variety, but its ample supply of good fun makes it a bright entertainment.Miss Bennett shines as a comedienne. She does not fail to take full advantage of the humorous incidents. Franchot Tone is equally clever in a rôle that calls for a serious mien, and Tullio Carminati, although frequently given to exaggerating his facial expressions, makes quite a favorable impression.Apparently no narrative of life behind the scenes is considered complete without having the heroine triumph on the stage, and, as in other films of this type, the persons in this offering are extravagant in their enthusiasm over the singing of Helen Hall (Miss Bennett), who happens to be masquerading as a continental music hall performer rejoicing in the name of Raquel. It is true that Helen acquits herself favorably, but she is hardly the genius she is considered to be by Le Maire (Mr. Carminati), the producer of the stage show, and Douglas Hall (Mr. Tone), the author, who never having beheld his wife as a blonde or heard her talk with a French accent, does not recognize her. This unfortunate husband, who had cast aspersions on his wife's talent as a performer, because he wished to discourage her from returning to a stage career, not only praises her singing, but becomes enamored of her, believing, of course, that she is Raquel.In this tale of gay deception and cunning, there are dancing spectacles staged by Russell Markert, and several singing numbers, which include "Coffee in the Morning and Kisses at Night," "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" and "Song of Surrender."Judging by the introductory episodes, it is very annoying to have a wife with stage aspirations. At least Douglas Hall thinks so. When his brunette wife essays a performance, he does not hesitate to discourage her. Later there comes the time when he cannot resist the alluring Raquel, as he supposes his wife to be, and she, like Molnar's Guardsman, is by no means happy to learn that her husband is so susceptible to feminine wiles.Nunnally Johnson is responsible for this little story, and Sidney Lanfield officiated as the director. Mr. Lanfield has done well in not permitting any too lengthy interruptions by spectacles in the story, but while he was about it he might have resisted the temptation to have one of those obstreperous drunks turning up in so many different episodes.It is interesting to note that none other than Helen Westley, the well-known actress who is a member of the board of directors of the Theatre Guild, makes her début in this production as an elderly woman named Mrs. Morris, a retired stage luminary who is in a measure responsible for Helen's huge success. Miss Westley, it is almost superfluous to state, is excellent in this rôle.During the presentation of the stage production Russ Columbo sings, as do also the Boswell Sisters. MOULIN ROUGE, based on a story by Nunnally Johnson; music and lyrics by Al Dubin and Harry Warren; directed by Sidney Lanfield; a Twentieth Century production; released by United Artists.

575-> Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper in a Film Version of Stevenson's "Treasure Island."
As fine a lot of cutthroats as ever have infested a film turn up as pirates in the latest cinematic conception of Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure Island," which is now on exhibition at the Capitol. Long John Silver appears in the person of Wallace Beery, who does extraordinarily well at hobbling about the sets on one leg and a crutch, with a parrot perched on his shoulder.Although there are occasional studio interpolations, the present screen offering is a moderately satisfactory production. It has not the force or depth of the parent work and, kind as one might wish to be to the adaptation, it always seems synthetic. However, hitherto on the stage and in two silent films of the same subject, the rôle of Jim Hawkins has been acted by a girl. One is spared this weakness in this picture, for that able juvenile, Jackie Cooper, plays Jim, and, although he may not impress one as being the Jim of the book, he does fairly well.In the film there are several effective settings, such as those of the Ben Bow Inn, the schooner Hispaniola and the stockade on Skeleton Island. When the time comes to reveal the treasure, Victor Fleming, the director, shows a heap of golden pieces and boxes of jewels, thus making it worth all the trouble taken by Dr. Livesey, Squire Trelawney and the ship's gallant skipper, Captain Smollett.Charles (Chic) Sale is cast as Ben Gunn who, having been deserted by pirates and left for three years on the island, has one thing uppermost in his mind, and that is a good piece of cheese. In one of the closing incidents Gunn is discovered on the ship's deck with a cheese about the size of the average water melon, and he consumes it very much in the same way a Negro eats the popular fruit.If this picture does not come up to expectations, it is at least a good deal better than the films of most classics. One feels that its chief shortcomings are an overzealousness to make it exciting and an eagerness to thrust forth comedy relief. If Mr. Beery is not precisely the character drawn by Stevenson, he deserves praise for giving as good a performance as was possible in the circumstances. Lionel Barrymore lends his talent to the part of Billy Bones. Otto Kruger, although too immaculately clad and made-up as Dr. Livesey, acts pleasingly. Nigel Bruce does a good piece of acting as the garrulous Trelawney and Lewis Stone as Captain Smollett is a decided asset. Mr. Sale is not amiss as the crack-brained Ben Gunn.The principals in the Capitol stage show are George Givot, Peggy Taylor and her Kitchen Pirates, the Four Trojans, Pete, Peaches and Duke, the Chester Hale dancers and Joe Morrison.

604-> THE SCREEN; A Soviet Newsreel.
Persons desirous of seeing the bright side of modern Turkey, but hesitant as to spending the money necessary for a trip to the republic ruled by Mustafa Kemal Pasha, may find a good substitute at the little Acme Theatre in Union Square.Under the name of "Soviets Greet New Turkey," the Russian film makers, with the cooperation of the Turkish Government, have turned out a gigantic newsreel recording many interesting scenes and incidents. The major part of the picture is devoted to the visit paid to Ankara last October by a delegation of high Soviet officials, including Klementy Voroshiloff, Commissar of Defense; S. M. Budyonny, chief of the Red Army's cavalry; L. M. Kharakan, Assistant Commissar of Foreign Affairs, and Andrey Bubnoff, Commissar of Education, on the occasion of the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the proclamation of the Turkish Republic. While there naturally are many views of the hearty reception of the visitors in Istanbul and in the Turkish capital, followed by a lengthy chronicling of the official ceremonies, enough attention is paid to the life of the common people and to the old part of ancient Ankara to give the spectators a fairly comprehensive idea of the country as a whole.Knowledge of Turkish or Russian is quite unnecessary for the enjoyment of the picture, as there are plenty of English titles, and aside from the formal speech by Kemal Pasha at the celebration, there is very little dialogue. The photography is up to the standard expected in Soviet films and the musical accompaniment is a pleasing blend of Turkish, Russian and French compositions.

640-> A County Fair Tragedy.
There is a fatal fascination about pictures like "She Made Her Bed," which opened at the Rialto yesterday. It is the fascination of horror—of horror that any person, or group of persons, should ever have conceived its preposterous characters and situations, or, conceiving, should have ventured to commit them to even so ephemeral a medium as the films.In the 1933 locale of this picture—which evidently takes place on a sort of fourth dimensional time-plane, like "The Lost World" of Mr. H. G. Wells—an extinct type, the itinerant "medicine man," exists in the handsome person of Richard Arlen. Wild Bill Smith is the name of this character, which, strangely enough, is quite the tamest in the cast.Lura Gordon (Sally Eilers)—who you know instinctively will love Mr. Arlen as soon as she has laid eyes upon his anachronistic charm—is the wife of a blustering and too ostentatiously wayward proprietor of a tourist camp, in which the divergent and otherwise apparently quite blank life-cycles of Mr. Arlen, and of Grace Bradley, who plays the amorous foil to Mr. Armstrong, are supposed to complete themselves annually, at county fair time—in Miss Bradley's case for no discernible reason.The action takes place at two successive fairs, and Armstrong, who loves to show off in a cage of bobcats in the first year, in the second acquires a tiger which you know instinctively will be there to remove him from the scene as soon as he begins to obstruct the plot. Miss Bradley, who drives in from the California desert, with rustic parents (whom she subsequently ditches altogether) has nevertheless somewhere managed to pick up all the ropes, including the accent, the odious manners, and the idiom, of the urban underworld.The situations and incidents, in their turn, are equally mad—mad with the cold-blooded madness of Hollywood. You have already perceived, for example, that Mr. Armstrong is going to be mauled by the tiger, but you would never in a thousand years guess that he will also be cremated in his blazing home, in order that his wife and her lover may be spared certain disagreeable legal details.Or that, to cap what is left in the way of a climax. Miss Eiler's infant will be snatched unsinged from the burning maelstrom, his mother having thoughtfully placed him in the ice-box for safekeeping—not, however, before the child has figured in a needlessly scarifying scene with the tiger, prowling about in its nursery.Though it is fastened upon a story by James M. Cain, the blame for this picture is too large, too richly complicated, to be attached to any one person however prolific a source of imbecilities. SHE MADE HER BED, based on James M. Cain's story "The Baby in the Ice-Box"; directed by Ralph Murphy; a Paramount production. At the Rialto.Wild Bill Smith . . . . . Richard ArlenLura Gordon . . . . . Sally EilersDuke Gordon . . . . .

873-> PARIS SCREEN NOTES
THE screen is not noted for its ability to make audiences stop to think of the great problems of humanity and contemporary social adjustments. Its self-imposed task—and it is a great enough one, particularly in these difficult times—is to amuse and entertain, to make people forget for a few hours that all is not for the best in this best of all possible worlds. But there are exceptions to this rule, and they are becoming more frequent. Paris has an unusually large assortment of such pictures at the present moment, including one American and one British example.The Hollywood specimen, "Death Takes a Holiday," has had a great critical success, which is natural enough in a country whose people are particularly prone to subtle and philosophical analyses of human emotions. London's "Sorrell and Son" is also providing thought-provoking material in this country, where war and its consequences are absorbing much attention.The best of the French films under consideration, "Cessez le feu!" (Cease Firing), is, in subject, very much like "Sorrell and Son." They are both stories of the effect of a crass, materialistic, post-war world on noble, sensitive men who thought the high fervor and comradeship of fighting days would not and with the armistice.War's Aftermath.Captain Cartier, escadrille leader and great war hero, pays dearly for his stubborn belief that those who were willing, without a second thought, to give their lives for their comrades would be as loyal and self-sacrificing in civilian life. He finds that courage, honor, morality, which to him were as natural as the air he breathes, were to most of the others the complement of hourly danger and an aroused patriotism. The important position he left is refused to him; the means that are offered to him of making money are repugnant to his pride and sense of decency; the woman he loves is stolen from him by the man who was his lieutenant; another of his men, become a wealthy airplane manufacturer, refuses him a small service. Only two remain loyal to him, a humble mechanic and his sergeant, now turned gigolo.Fifteen years have passed in this hopeless struggle for a place in society when the escadrille gets together for a banquet to celebrate the coming of age of the son of one of their comrades killed in action. Cartier, as their captain, is to preside, and having redeemed his evening clothes from the pawnshop he appears among them as his old self, with never a hint of the suffering he has gone through or the bitterness it has left. But this gathering of old comrades arouses little by little the feelings of friendship, loyalty and nobility of soul that used to be theirs in the days when they fought and suffered together. Bitterness is effaced, ingratitude is forgotten. Because they were great of soul once, they feel a pride which none but they can share. An unspoken desire soon impregnates the atmosphere: this man who led them through fire, and who is now once again their captain, cannot be abandoned to an enemy worse than those he faced in the war. The airplane manufacturer chooses him to pilot his plane on a great transoceanic flight. Cartier succeeds and finds once again that he has a place in the world.Honey and Wormwood.Despite the more or less happy ending, the dominant impression which obviously was left both upon the audiences and the critics was one of bitterness. Both the superb acting of Jean Galland as Cartier and the directing of Messrs. Kessel and de Baroncelli were plainly designed to drive home the lesson that, for those who fought that better times might come, this world is a bitterly disappointing place. There is a corollary to it, which perhaps only those who lived in the midst of it would ever be willing to admit, which is that in many respects men were more worthy creatures then than they have ever been since.This beautiful and thought-provoking film is one of the best pictures that 1934 has brought to the French screen, but there are others being shown that are also of high calibre and equally worthy of serious thought. The screen version of Henri Bataille's famous play "Le Scandale," which Marcel L'Herbier has just brought out, is such a picture.This is the sort of "problem play" of marital infidelity and its consequences which is so dear to the French stage and lately the French screen. The story is about the wife of a rich business man, Mme. Férioul, who finds life a little dull and, though sincerely loving her husband, yields momentarily to the glamour of an adventurer and is unfaithful. The scandal is caused by the fact that in her moment of aberration she gives the man a beautiful diamond ring which her husband has just presented to her. The gigolo pawns it; Mme. Férioul tells her husband she has lost it, and the insurance company traces it. The husband learns of her deception and wrathfully calls his household, including their two children, around him, and then summons his wife, intending to denounce her before them all and send her away. But, softened by the profound sorrow and obviously sincere repentance of his wife, he makes believe he had called every one in merely to inflict an exemplary punishment on one of the children.Gaby Morlay gives a touching performance as Mme. Férioul, and we once again find Jean Galland, as (he adventurer, in a part suited to his sober and sincere talent.Still another example of this intelligent, thoughtful type of picture is "Paquebot Tenacity," which the New York stage saw some years back in an English translation as "S. S. Tenacity." It was written by Charles Vildrac and originally produced at the Vieux Colombier here. Its screen version has been splendidly adapted by Julien Duvivier, one of the very best French directors. The result is a delicately told and charming film, set in a truly beautiful framework.Fortune Seekers.The plot, for those who didn't see the play, is about two friends—workmen—who decide to seek their fortune in Canada. Segard isn't so enthusiastic, but Bastien is so persuasive he actually induces his friend to give up a good job in Paris to go. They reach Havre and pass a gay, farewell evening, but the Tenacity is hardly out of the harbor when an accident to its machinery forces it back. It is going to take two weeks to repair the damages, so the friends decide to go to a boarding house at Havre and somehow manage to eke out a living until the Tenacity gets under way again.At the boarding house they find that the landlady has a very pretty servant, Thérèse, and they both immediately start paying court to her—Bastien in a jolly, devil-may-care manner and Segard all the more timid because he finds that he is really in love with the girl. It is Bastien who wins, partly with the aid of a plentiful supply of champagne, and when the two weeks are up Bastien and Thérèse are so happy in each other's company that Segard finds there is nothing better for him to do than to board the S. S. Tenacity alone and sail away sadly to Canada.It is a slight and frail plot, but there is a great deal of profound human philosophy behind it, which makes the memory of it linger rather wistfully. Marie Glory is a lovely Thérèse, while Albert Préjean as Bastien and Hubert Prélier, who created the part, as Segard, are both excellent in their rôles.Harvey Stephens, Irene Harvey and Robert Taylor have received new acting contracts at the MGM studios.

897-> A Magyar Romantic Comedy.
If any further proof is needed that the "how" is more important than the "what" in the matter of motion-picture entertainment, persons familiar with the Hungarian language may find it at the little Tobis Theatre, where "My Wife, the Miss" is being shown.Although the subject of the maiden (Miss Agay) married off against her will by a gay father (Gabor Rajnay) to an impecunious but likely young man (Paul Javor), with the inevitable result, has been told on stage and screen for many, many years, this Maygar company puts so much humor and snap into the action that even spectators unable to follow the dialogue may be interested and amused. This merry tale is well spiced with lively songs and some dancing and the scenes in the famous Tokay wine-growing district are calculated to promote homesickness among the Hungarian population of Yorkville.While the acting of the whole cast is good, the work of the attractive Miss Agay and of Mr. Rajnay is especially effective. The direction is sure, the photography is good and the sound reproduction, although rather high-pitched at times, is generally clear.

1087-> Defense of Snooping.
Back in the good old days—before the Broadway gossip columnists arrived—it was considered wrong to eavesdrop. "Ladies Should Listen," now showing at the Paramount, is, if anything, a defense of snooping. The film's snooper-in-chief is Frances Drake. Its snoopee, as it were, is Cary Grant.Miss Drake, as Anna Mirelle, has a perfect eavesdropping set-up. She is the telephone girl in the hotel where Julian de Lussac (Mr. Grant) is alternately engrossed in affairs of the heart and worry over his expiring option on a Chilean nitrate concession. Anna has formed the delightful habit of listening in on Julian's calls. She knows, there-from, exactly how he spends his days—and nights.Armed with this knowledge and spurred by that emotion which makes the world go round, she appoints herself a committee of one for the salvation of Julian. She entangles, and disentangles, his romantic affairs. She saves him—and his nitrate concession—from a scheming woman and her husband. She gets him engaged to an heiress, thereby assuring him of financial support for the Chilean proposition. And eventually (need it be said?) she wins the hero's heart.It is an alarming thesis, this "Ladies Should Listen." Every impressionable telephone operator who chances to see the picture becomes a potential ruler of destiny. Single young men might do well, until this film has passed, to speak in code over their home phones or to call from the corner drug store.Aside from its theme, the Paramount offering has little to recommend it. There are a few brief moments when the spectator entertains some hope that the picture is getting into the farce stride, but the promise is not kept; the film sags painfully. It resorts to a number of dull and more than faintly reminiscent situations, and the dialogue sparkles but seldom.On the stage the theatre is presenting an intimate revue called "Young America," featuring three young radio performers—Victor Young, musical conductor; Leo Wiley, singer, and Bob Crosby, younger brother of the better-known Bing. LADIES SHOULD LISTEN, based on a story by Guy Bolton and Alfred Savoir; directed by Frank Tuttle; a Paramount production. At the Paramount.Julian de Lussac . . . . . Gary GrantAnna Mirelle . . . . .

1471-> Among the Salvage Divers.
These sequels to "What Price Glory?" are getting to look more and more like the results of a contest among the studio office boys for the best McLaglen-Lowe gag of the week. This time the ponderous Mr. McLaglen and the comparatively slight Mr. Lowe are salvage divers in "No More Women," the formula of which seems more rigid and mechanical than usual. Mr. Lows, by reason of his superior wit, puts one over on his lustier partner. Then Mr. McLaglen, more by accident than because of any native shrewdness, receives an opportunity to strike back at his enemy. Usually the fight is over a girl, who finally eludes both of them. When it is all over they grin through their bruises and agree to form a partnership in misogyny.In the Rialto's latest variation of the feud their quarrels are for the favor of a young woman who has inherited the salvage boat on which Forty-Fathom (Mr. McLaglen) works. Three-Time (Mr. Lowe), his sworn foe and leading rival for the title of ace diver of the Pacific Coast, promptly joins the ship. The high mark in the humor is a dizzy fist fight on a speeding roller-coaster. Forty-Fathom is tossed into the sea. With characteristic malice he keeps out of sight so that the police will give him up for dead and then sits back to enjoy the prospect of seeing Three-Time go to the electric chair for murder. The most interesting scenes in the film are those beneath the sea, where the salvage divers rummage for treasure in sunken ships. NO MORE WOMEN, based on "Underseas," by John Mikale Strong, directed by Albert Rogell; a Paramount production. At the Rialto.Three-Time . . . . . Edmund LoweForty-Fathom . . . . .
