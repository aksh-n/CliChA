106-> At the 55th Street
Although the great actor, Raimu, died in 1946, the French film importers still are bringing pictures starring him to these shores. Latest of these endless relics to be exhibited here is "Strangers in the House," a solemn drama, which was put on at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse yesterday. Also marking this item as worthy of further note is the fact that it was written by Henri-Georges Clouzot, the man who subsequently directed "The Raven" and "Jenny Lamour."However, despite these distinctions, one must regretfully remark that "Strangers in the House" is no great credit to anyone involved—and that includes Pierre Fresnay, who "narrates" sections of it. Clearly revealing its oldness—a matter of some eight or ten years—it takes a long time in telling a rambling and complicated tale of juvenile indiscretion, and parental apathy. And it seems to be hindered further by some curiously critical cuts.Equally disappointing is the fact that the talented Raimu does very little in it until a few minutes before the end. Then, after mumbling and bumbling for an interminable time as a drunk, he gives a galvanic oration to bring the whole thing to a close. Defending the wayward lover of his neglected daughter in court, he blames the sins of the children on their parents, including himself. With that he subsides in a vapor of hot air and alcohol.Obvious and sentimental, this film touches feebly upon a matter of much more moment than it is allowed to acquire, and it is played in a ponderous fashion by an undistinguished cast. Juliette Faber as the daughter is the most convincing of the lot. Even Raimu gives little evidence of being interested in it. STRANGERS IN THE HOUSE, adapted from the Georges Simenon novel by Henri-Georges Clouzot; dialogue by M. Clouzot; produced by Union Generale Cinematographique and released by Lopert Films.Loursat . . . . . RaimuNicole . . . . . Juliette FaberRogissart . . . . . Jacques BaumerDucup . . . . .

750-> Duo of Imports From France
So much is so good about "Loves of Colette," one of two French films that arrived yesterday at the Ambassador, that it's unfortunate indeed that the picture as a whole doesn't add up to solid entertainment. Siritzky International, the importers, haven't helped matters by tieing on a rusty Gothic tin can called "The Devil and the Angel," starring Erich von Stroheim and Madeleine Sologne."Colette" is an ingeniously written and well-acted tale of an aging Caspar Milquetoast professor in a provincial school for boys that manages to be both convincing and absorbing for about three quarters of the way. Against an amusing graduation ceremony background, a young athletics coach reads the diary of the teacher, who has just attempted to hang himself.Through flashback it is shown that the hero was beloved and respected by one and all, particularly by the president's daughter, with whom he was conducting a steamy platonic affair. But a tearful student's confession—and another flashback—reveals what actually happened. The old boy was a hopeless paranoiac, so thoroughly tricked by his cunning pupils into believing his love to be mutual that even his own diary recorded him as a man among men, not the contemptuous boor he was.It's a risky business for a film to back up and start over and still sustain interest, and "Loves of Colette" ends on a note of confusion, even flippancy, as a result, for the professor simply trudges down the road without a fare-thee-well from the performers or the producers. But this film, in general, is about nice people who react spontaneously in an interesting situation, and the acting is impeccable—from François Perier, the dismal hero, down to the superficially sadistic youths who almost unhinge him. And even if it doesn't come off, somebody certainly had the right idea. LOVES OF COLETTE, story and dialogue by Henri Jeanson; released here by Siritzky International.

806-> Fox Musical, 'Dancing in Dark,' Opens at Roxy -- Betsy Drake, William Powell in Cast
This corner had never expected to find Twentieth Century-Fox telling the world in public how extravagant and reckless it is. Any such wicked implication would be loudly and proudly disclaimed if it came from a rank outsider—as, for instance, a reviewer of films. Yet here is that studio proclaiming its prodigality without let or shame in its new musical at the Roxy, "Dancing in the Dark."In the first place, it tells us quite frankly that the characters in this Technicolored tale are all of them partly or wholly, employes of Twentieth Century-Fox. There is the head of the studio, for instance—one Crossman, whom Adolphe Menjou plays—a gentleman whose vanity is conspicuous and who spends money with a free and lavish hand. Then there are his various assistants whose mental limitations are broadly stressed, and there's a press agent, played by Mark Stevens whose singular interest is a girl.But particularly there is a fellow—a has-been actor, performed by William Powell—who is hired by the studio (now get this!) to pull off a vital deal. This fellow, who is noted for his arrogance—his supreme disdain and conceit—is sent by the studio to New York to sign up a musical comedy star to appear in a Fox musical version of "Bandwagon," the old Broadway revue. And not only is he permittted to spend money like a drunken tar, but he is carelessly allowed to bring to Hollywood an unknown actress to play the role instead. This latter surprising young lady, played by Betsy Drake, is introduced to the New York film people at a dazzling party—but this the studio apparently doesn't know.We mention these joyous demonstrations of unstinted extravagance in detail because they seem not entirely disassociated from the actual production of this film. For somehow we can't help feeling that the same sort of jovial recklessness that goes into the fictitious selection of a star for "Bandwagon" went into the making of "Dancing in the Dark." The story is gay and inviting, up to a definite point, and then it goes hopelessly to pieces in a great big sentimental heap. (It seems that Miss Drake, brought to Hollywood, turns out to be a sensation all right but she balks at working in the picture when she discovers that Mr. Powell is her father who deserted her mother before she was born!)And although Miss Drake is a young lady with considerable natural charm, she is hardly the person to handle the singing music of the old "Bandwagon" score. She is all right when she is playing the diffident manners of a Broadway "unknown" or even in the romantic moments with Mr. Stevens, of which there are a few. But when she is singing and dancing "Louisa," "New Sun in the Sky" or the title song, she is something less than beguiling. A very fine score is pretty much thrown away.So is the highly potential character which Mr. Powell plays. In other circumstances and other surroundings, he might be an absolute charm. But to turn such a sharp and witty rascal into a contrite papa and a wistful Cyrano is to dissipate all the distinction that the character initially suggests.The laughter was sparse and fitful in the morning audience at the Roxy yesterday. It could be that many in the audience were stockholders of Twentieth Century-Fox.On the stage at the Roxy are Mindy Carson, Tommy Trent and his Puppets, the Debonaires, Los Gatos, Chandra Kaly and his dancers and the Gae Foster Roxyettes. DANCING IN THE DARK, screen play by Mary C. McCall Jr.; directed by Irving Reis; produced by George Jessel for Twentieth Century-Fox. At the Roxy.Emery Slade . . . . .

946-> Romantic Artist; THOMAS GAINSBOROUGH. By Mary Woodall. 128 pp. New York: Chanticleer Press. $2.75.
GAINSBOROUGH is an exception to the rule that the artist's work explains the man. For, if the whole spirit of Georgian England seems crystallized in his graceful aristocratic portraits and in his exquisite landscapes, Gainsborough himself was a most un-eighteenth century character, a far stranger and more violent man than these placid works would lead one to believe.

968-> Nightingale; THE PASSIONATE PILGRIM. By Charles Terrot. 231 pp. New York: Harper & Brothers. $2.75.

1015-> THE SCREEN
Credit Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder, the British film makers who produced "The Blue Lagoon," with being true to their firm name, Individual Pictures. For the South Seas idyll they have fashioned, which came to the Globe on Saturday, is as out of this hectic world as any distant, peaceful Polynesian paradise. But like life in such verdant, faraway places, drama is practically non-existent in "The Blue Lagoon." What does occur is presented in slowly moving incidents that rarely excite but are set against the breathtakingly beautiful background of Technicolor sunsets, dazzling beaches, green and blue seas and lagoon and the myriad greens of the lush island on which the story takes place.It is a simple yarn that they have culled from H. deVere Stackpoole's novel about what happened to a boy and girl cast away on an uninhabited isle. The English youngsters, who are 9 and 10 when they are shipwrecked circa 1904, manage to survive even after the Irish sailor with whom they are marooned is killed after a drinking bout.The ingenuous castaways learn the primitive arts of hunting, fishing, cooking, building and weaving. After some ten years and an unhappy encounter with their first visitors—a couple of disreputable English expatriates—the pair discover they are in love. Remembering their correct British backgrounds, they devise a marriage ceremony. And when a son eventually comes along the couple, anxious to bring him to civilization, reluctantly leave their island in a crudely rigged boat, which is eventually picked up by a passing steamer.The small cast is generally competent in situations and dialogue marked by tenderness and sometimes by genuine beauty. As the girl, Jean Simmons, noted for her performances as Ophelia in "Hamlet" and in "Great Expectations," is wistful and attractive in various sarongs and flowing hair, while Donald Houston, a newcomer, is blond, laconic and virile as her mate. Susan Stranks and Peter Jones, who portray the pair as children, and Noel Purcell, as the Irish seaman who is the children's companion on their first days on the island, pitch in with sturdy supporting characterizations. It is unfortunate, however, that they are up against an unbeatable attraction in the Technicolor setting of "The Blue Lagoon." South Sea Idyll THE BLUE LAGOON, screen play by Frank Launder, John Baines and Michael Hogan; based on the novel by H. deVere Stackpoole; directed by Mr. Launder; a Sidney Gilliat-Frank Launder production; presented by J. Arthur Rank and released here by Universal-International. At the Globe.Emmeline Foster . . . . . Jean SimmonsMichael Reynolds . . . . . Donald HoustonEmmeline Foster (as a child) . . . . .

1244-> Review 1 -- No Title; 'Slattery's Hurricane' at Roxy Barely Touches the Secrets of Meteorological Fury
Considering the title of the Roxy's new film, "Slattery's Hurricane," it is quite proper that howling wind and driving rain should figure importantly in the drama. In fact, we wish that Twentieth Century-Fox had given even more footage to the raging elements and to the fascinating business of plotting the course of hurricanes by flying planes into the "eye" of the disturbance, where an awesome, dead calm prevails. For there is fresh excitement in the sequences showing how daring Navy pilots, operating out of an east Florida coast base, gather data which en-ables meterologists to determine when and where these big blows will strike inland.That is a lot more than can be said for the routine recollections which pass through Will Slattery's mind and take up most of the camera's attention. Trying to right a wrong done to a friend by taking his place on a dangerous weather mission, and with the wind tossing his plane about as one of its twin engines goes dead, Slattery's mind backtracks over the years. The picture he gets of himself is far from consoling. He has been pretty much of a heel, and the wonder is that the scenarists had the temerity to make a hero out of him in the end.A wartime Navy fighter pilot, who single handedly sunk a Jap cruiser, Slattery becomes an aerial chauffeur to a candy manufacturer. Although his several bosses have all the characteristics of gangsters, he chooses to give them the benefit of doubt because the money comes easily. When he finally discovers that he is mixed up with dope smugglers, he tries to cash in on the racket. He also has put an admiring female in the hospital in a state of nervous collapse with his indifference. And, having discovered that his wartime buddy is married to an ex-flame, Slattery does his best to wreck that marriage.His redemption up in the wild and not-so-blue yonder is a palpable hoax. However, Richard Widmark plays this conventional rogue with more intensity and professional acumen than the role deserves. But it is a good thing that Mr. Widmark was so willing and earnest because had his acting been less worthy "Slattery's Hurricane" would have tumbled like a stack of cards in the wind. Andre de Toth's direction is good in that it keeps the story moving and, curiously enough, the constant switching via flashbacks from the plane to detailed visualizations of Slattery's recollections is not as disturbing as might be expected.Linda Darnell is pleasing, but doesn't have much of an opportunity to really act, in the role of the wife who is sorely tempted by her old boy friend. Veronica Lake is pleasing, too, as the other girl. John Russell, Gary Merrill and several others in lesser roles are quite good also. But since those who planned this film either didn't have the imagination or the desire to concentrate on the business of exploring hurricanes the end result of "Slattery's Hurricane" is just a very ordinary movie. There still must be a rousing dramatic experience lurking in man's latest campaign to fathom the secrets of nature's fury.Sid Caesar and Evelyn Knight are featured in the Roxy's stage show which also includes a new ice revue. SLATTERY'S HURRICANE, screen play by Herman Wouk and Richard Murphy based on the book by Mr. Wouk; directed by Andre de Toth; produced by William Perlberg for Twentieth Century-Fox.

1439-> Psychological Murder Drama at Paramount
Murder is a common and salable screen commodity. But "The Accused," which opened yesterday at the Paramount, is no ordinary exercise in violence. This is a super-duper psychological job, well spiced with terminology which sounds impressive, if not always crystal clear in meaning, and the performers go about their business with an earnestness which commands attention.Under William Dieterle's assured direction, the story flows smoothly and methodically builds up suspense to a punchy climax which leaves it to the audience to determine whether the defendant should be punished or go free.That must have been quite a concession for the Production Code people of the Johnston office, who are usually quite fussy about exacting retribution. The departure should not be construed as a body blow to morality, however, for it is made quite evident that the heroine acted instinctively to protect her honor. And, even the poiliceman who doggedly pieces together the fragments of evidence which expose her has nothing but sympathy and admiration in his heart for the lady.It may be presumed, too, that Loretta Young's appearance in a role of this type is further evidence that Wilma Tuttle, the unfortunate psychology professor, acted with justifiable vigor, for Miss Young just isn't the murderess type. But, regardless of motive and questions of guilt or innocence, the taking of life is not to be dismissed lightly and the due process of law must be taken into account."The Accused" is a fine exemplification of crime detection, for with little tangible evidence to go on Lieut. Ted Dorgan, a rough, practical student of human nature, painstakingly builds a strong circumstantial case around Dr. Tuttle and finally breaks through her psychological armor. On close examination it is possible to spot loopholes in the plot and, indeed, it may seem surprising that a woman of such intelligence couldn't view her dilemma with more perspicacity, but the authors have shrewdly attributed her desire to conceal the truth to her dread fear of the scandalous consequences. And who wants to argue about a person's actions when fear takes hold?Miss Young brings a high degree of conviction to her portrayal and the same goes for Wendell Corey as Lieutenant Dorgan. Robert Cummings, as the guardian of the dead student who falls in love with the professor, holds a conventional role on a steady level most of the time, and Sam Jaffe has a small but sharp role as a laboratory criminologist.
