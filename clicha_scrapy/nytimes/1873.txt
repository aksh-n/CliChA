--------
101-> How Good Government Pays.
Tax-payers would do well to keep in view the comparison of local expenditures in 1871 and 1872, to be found in the Mayor's Inaugural Message. That statement showed very clearly how gross a swindle was the Ring device of a two per cent. tax levy. 
--------
102-> Capt. Jack and the Modocs.

--------
108-> NEW-HAMPSHIRE.; Result of the Election Yesterday Probably No Election for Governor The Congressional Delegation.
CONCORD, N.H., March 12. Sufficient election returns are received to warrant the conclusion that there will be no choice for Governor, so that the question will go to the new Legislature to decide, and that there will be at least two Democrats or Liberal Republicans, so called, returned to Congress.

A meeting of the Dock Commissioners was held yesterday, John T. Agnew presiding. All the Commissioners were present. 
--------
118-> A Plea for Resumption.
It is a sign of a bad financial condition that the question of the resumption of specie payments is rarely discussed. For a few years after the war the necessity of preparing for a return to the specie basis seemed to be recognized, and the discussions in Congress and in the Press, and the reports of the Secretary of the Treasury, were largely devoted to the subject.

Mr. BOUTWELL'S election to the Senate necessarily involves his immediate retirement from the Treasury Department.

150-> Work Before the Legislature.
No limit has yet been fixed for the session of the Legislature, but the 100 days for which the members receive pay will expire on Thursday, and it is not probable they can be held together much longer.

Occurring, as it will, at the very dullest moment of the dull season, the proposed pilgrimage of British Catholics to some holy shrine near Paris, of which I at this moment forget the  name, cannot fail to enlist a considerable amount of attention.

The Bank rate of discout, which was expected to go up last week, has gone up to-day. It is now eight per cent. a dangerous figure  not only because it makes money tight, but because it frightens people.

The reappearance, at Booth's Theatre, of Miss Neilson, and the production at that house of "Amy Robsart," were subjects of comment in this place, on Tuesday, and need no further allusion.

181-> A Queer Reform.
We all thought that the ejectment of JAY GOULD from the management of the Erie Road was a great reform, and his subsequent "restitution" has been much applauded by some of the more pious and liberal journals, such as the Tribune and Nation.

In striking contrast to last year, when the boat race was rowed in the teeth of a blinding snow-storm, accompanied by a bitter wind from the north-east, Saturday proved to be the most glorious day of the present year.

PROVIDENCE, March 11. Mrs. Putnam, the widow of Foster's unfortunate victim, is very shy and retired concerning the rumors that she received $15,000 for writing a letter to Gov.

By a crime of unparalleled atrocity, the United States Army has lost one of its most valued officers in the murder of Gen. CANBY, and the Modoc chief, Capt.

1286-> ABOVE THE NINETIES.; THE TEMPERATURE IN THE CITY YESTERDAY THERMOMETRICAL RECORD.
The heat, which fortunately has, in a measure, spared New-York so far during the present Summer, visited it to some purpose yesterday. The spirit mounted up "among the nineties," and that signi- fies no pleasant warmth. In unsheltered places, early in the day, the sun was fiercely hot, and con- tinued, for hours, to pour its merciless rays on the heads of passing pedestrians.

"The Wandering Jew" was represented at the Grand Opera-house, last evening, with a strong distribution of characters and a very effective stage setting.

Ever since the announcement by SCHWABE, in 1851, of the remarkable fact that the number and magnitude of tho spots on the sun vary regularly with a period of about ten or eleven years, scientists have been on the lookout for reflections, so to speak, of this periodicity upon the earth.

It has long been a disputed question with some of the political economists how far bank checks, bills of exchange, and other forms of credit are money. We do not propose to enter on the discussion of this question now. It is by no means unimportant or uninteresting, and some conclusions of considerable value depend upon its decision.

English merchants who happen to be specially interested in the trade of the British settlements in West Africa, have been for some time past doing their utmost to induce her Majesty's Government to so change the policy hitherto pursued in the selection of officials as to render the civil service a credit, instead of being what it evidently now is a very great disgrace.

What was said in these columns a few days since, on the subject of training for athletic contests, was in a measure borne out by the result of Tuesday's sculling match at Springfield between BIGLIN and ELLIS WARD. From the start, the latter led his antagonist by nearly two lengths, rowing apparently in splendid form, and, up to the and of the second mile, was steadily increasing his lead.

1314-> BEWARE OF THE SHARPER.
It must not be assumed that the man who gets his money without earning it is a product of the prevalent hard times. He is always going his rounds seeking to impose upon the credulous. In fact, he is more industrious and more importunate in a season of prosperity than at any other period, for the unwary then have more money to part with, and a larger degree of success attends his operations.

The death of such a man as LOUIS AGASSIZ is an occasion which demands more than a mere obituary record of the course of his life and his contributions to science.
