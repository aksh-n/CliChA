540-> At Loew's Criterion
Having survived their clout-fests in "The Spoilers," John Wayne and Randolph Scott are again throwing their mitts high, wide and handsome for the sake of ideals and the woman—again, naturally, Marlene Dietrich. Against the brawling background of "Pittsburgh," now at the Criterion, they are repeating most of the shennanigans considered de rigeur in dramas about up-and-coming tycoons. As a pair of coal-mine lunkies who paw their way to the top, quarrel over noble principles, and finally are reunited by the war emergency, patriotism, and a stout speech for unity by Miss Dietrich, their story makes "Pittsburgh" another lusty and totally synthetic film.Perhaps you'll recognize the characters beneath those coal-smudged faces. Mr. Wayne is the hammer-fisted boy with the big ideas, and generally rides roughshod over all opposition, male or female, until he gets his comeuppance—but good. As his partner, Mr. Scott is just as tough but he sees things differently; he believes in giving his coal-miners a living wage, the public some of the benefits of his profits through hospitals and research institutes, and he believes in giving a lady an even break. As the lady who gets that break, after an ill-starred attachment for Mr. Wayne, Miss Dietrich emerges as a phoney countess, a rough-and-ready girl who's waiting for love on a white horse but keeps busy meanwhile.The fact that the three build a gargantuan coal and steel combine, only to see it fail through Mr. Wayne's antagonistic ways, and finally rise chastened to the top when war production requires their talents, merely proves that patriotism can make good men out of bad. "Pittsburgh" also proves that you can put an old design on a new chassis and it will still run. With the three stars in usual form, scientist-narrator who reminisces throughout the film, "Pittsburgh" is just another chance on the popular box-office sweepstakes and it may hit a modest jackpot. But it is routine entertainment at best.On the same bill at the Criterion, the Office of War Information offers its short subject "Point Rationing," a cartoon which will be placed on other Broadway screens today. As its title indicates, it is an explanation of the use of the new ration books for which everyone has been registering during the past three days. It also tells why rationing is necessary, and it tells it lucidly, quickly, and interestingly. It should be a timely and genuinely helpful item for those confused by the rows of numbers in their ration books.

669-> At the Palace
For a minor little item, "Cowboy In Manhattan," which opened at the Palace yesterday, stirs up a lot of memories. The plot of this Universal comedy deals largely with a publicity stunt conceived and executed by a Texas song writer to exploit a Broadway musical. In 1937 Universal turned out a more ambitious film entitled "You're a Sweetheart," which told a rather similar tale. Obviously any studio is qualified to borrow from its corporate self. But in "Cowboy In Manhattan," Frances Langford sums it up neatly, when she exclaims "it's the same old gag and you're wearing it thin." Yes, indeed, a shade too thin.Heading the theatre's double bill is the second-run "The Moon Is down."

734-> THE SCREEN; Where Hilarity Reigns
As a pair of unfrocked "Air Raid Wardens," Laurel and Hardy are again gamboling across the Rialto screen to the huge amusement of a house densely packed with soldiers, sailors, family parties and small fry aged 3 to 13. When Laurel's feet become entangled with the rungs of a ladder, the audience squirms with delight; when the pair solemnly open and close a window without a pane in it, chuckles break out like a rash all over the house; when Laurel puts on his best cry-baby face for the Nazi saboteur who is about to shoot him, the guffaws ring out loud and clear. Obviously the Rialto is not suffering from box-office anemia this week.But to at least one lone courier "Air Raid Wardens" seems little more than a mild two-reel comedy thinned out to feature length. The Laurel and Hardy style of stumbling idiocy seems considerably less hilarious today than it did in the heydey of two-reel comedies a decade and a half ago. As simple-tons who are caught in a complicated mesh of enemy intrigue and accidentally unmask a whole gang of villains, the pair still insist on traveling the longest distance between two points; the simplest acts such as pulling a rope or climbing a ladder become operations hardly less complicated than the invasion of Europe. But gags that were spontaneous comedy long ago seem premeditated today. Meanwhile the folks in the Rialto pews are laughing their heads off.

1452-> 'They Got Me Covered,' With Dorothy Lamour and Bob Hope Starred in Spy-Comedy, Arrives at the Music Hall
After groaning for eleven weeks with "Random Harvest" (to the management's unspeakable delight), the Music Hall's screen is now granted some well-earned, refreshing relief with a thoroughly unburdensome item called "They Got Me Covered," which came along yesterday. Amnesie or loss of memory, was the last problem pondered at "the Hall"; weakkneesia, or loss of resolution, is the problem pondered in this. For here is another of those pleasantly whacky Bob Hope farces, in which Bob and (this time) his favorite brunette and old-time running-mate, Dorothy Lamour, get mixed up with vicious Axis agents who are hatching a sabotage plot, and Bob goes after the villains with all the courage of a mouse tackling a cat.The business by now is as routine as is Bob's attitude. It seems that he was a correspondent in Moscow for a news agency until he overlooked a certain story—the German invasion of Russia. He was busy at the time. And so, the inevitable happens—he becomes a disassociated pressman and is marking time in Washington with his girl, Miss Lamour, when lightning strikes. A certain continental con-man tips him off to a big Axis plot to blow up virtually everything in Washington. (This is all before Pearl Harbor, obviously.) Whereupon Bob becomes a private G-man on his own recognizance and has a battering run of wild experiences before catching the villains in his own gag-net.Maybe the switch in producers—Samuel Goldwyn instead of Paramount—wasn't best. Maybe—or rather, most likely—the story in this case is rather flat. Anyhow, "They Got Me Covered" doesn't quite measure up in plot or speed to some of Mr. Hope's previous excursions in melodramatic farce. It drags in some critical phases, it labors in obvious spots and the climax is too manufactured. But there are side-splitting moments in it and one dandy sequence, at least, in which Bob has a weird conversation with a murderous maniac played by Donald Meek. Miss Lamour is very lovely if not too lively, Otto Preminger is himself (except for some hair) and a new and very fetching young actress named Lenore Aubert plays Mata Hari irresistably. But it is Bob who makes the picture—he and his great big gags. So long as he has them, he's covered—no matter how slight the story is. THEY GOT ME COVERED; screen play by Harry Kurnitz; from an original story by Leonard Q. Ross and Leonard Spigelgass; directed by David Butler; presented by Samuel Goldwyn and released by RKO Radio Pictures. At the Radio City Music Hall.Robert Kittredge . . . . .

1457-> At the Capitol
If "Reunion in France" is the best tribute that Hollywood can muster to the French underground forces of liberation, then let us try another time. For the new film which opened yesterday at the Capitol is again making the shallowest drama out of the pith and substance of an ironic tragedy. It is not a picture of France as it fights today in ways devious and dark; it is more simply a stale melodramatic exercise for a very popular star. In the role of a spoiled rich woman who finds her "soul" in the defeat of France, Joan Crawford is adequate to the story provided her, but that is hardly adequate to the theme. The picture is by MGM, Miss Crawford's ensembles by Irene.The plot moves by rote, the characters by the most trivial compulsions. Miss Crawford appears as a giddy lady who thinks wars are merely the pastimes of overgrown boys until France is crushed and she returns to Paris to discover that her fiancé, an industrial designer, and the Nazi officials are thick as thieves. Amid her bewilderment she takes a passing fancy to a pursued American flyer, helps im to safety, but returns to her earlier love when she discovers that the designer's vast plants are actually turning out faulty weapons for the Nazis, while simultaneously organizing a nucleus of armed forces for the future.On the basis of evidence to date, MGM seems somewhat off base when it infers that the initiative for a French resurrection comes from its moneyed society folk and spendthrifts; hardly an ordinary French citizen appears in the film. Instead, most of the action takes place against a background of palatial homes and lavish coutouriere's establishments. Most of the lines and situations might be taken from Italian opera—they're hollow and stilted like the dressmaker's declaration: "How can you expect a woman to cry at the collapse of an empire?"Under the circumstances, one can't ask too much of the performances. Miss Crawford as usual makes an elegant manikin for a series of ensembles that probably will excite more female comment than the picture itself. Philip Dorn is a good deal better than his role of the designer and John Wayne is totally unconvincing as the American flyer. Lesser roles are played by Albert Basserman, John Carradine and Reginald Owen. As for "Reunion in France," it has had the temerity to be glibly untruthful on serious matters. It has slipped on its own banana oil.
