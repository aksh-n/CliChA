9-> A FRESH WORK ON ICED DRINKS.
"At this season it will be in place," writes a physician in a paper on household chemistry, "to say something as to the wholesomeness of the extremely cold water, tea, lemonade, , which are so extensively used in this country.

--------
15-> THE REVOLT IN CUBA.
It is very difficult to make out how important or promising is the present revolt in Cuba. The difficulty seems curious, considering that Havana is not half as far again from New-York as Chicago. But it is an increasing difficulty. New-Yorkers, and Americans in general, knew more about Cuba thirty years ago than they know now, and their interest was more sympathetic as well as more intelligent than it is now.

Among the weak points indicated by the first day of actual trial of the preparations made for receiving visitors at Jackson Park is the utter failure, amounting, indeed, to a complete breakdown of the police arrangements.

It is as easy and true as it is useless to say that the kind of amusement presented at Palmer's Theatre during the past week is not of a high order, that its humor is of an elementary sort, and that the piece shows hardly a touch of The dramatic either in its construction or in its presentation. These facts are self-evident.

ALBANY, N.Y., Aug. 19 -- Owing to circumstances sometimes altogether beyond their control, there is usually very little demand for valets in practical politics.

579-> SOME OTHER MAN THAN MURPHY.
From the Richmond (Va.) State, (Dem.) In short, Mr. Cleveland has done what he considers his duty, and leaves the responsibility with the New-York Democratic Legislature.

The usual anxiety is being manifested at Washington regarding delay in acting on the appropriation bills.

--------
1041-> THE SPRING MILLINERY.
The mid winter millinery is so pretty that to displace it with Spring work, which cannot assume definite form for several weeks, seems altogether too bad.

The two murder trials in which the evidence of medical experts has recently figured so conspicuously have attracted attention to the question of the value of such evidence and of the wisdom of the present method of submitting it.
