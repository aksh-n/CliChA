267-> Drama of a Father and Son in 'O'Shaughnessy's Boy,' at the Capitol -- 'The Last Outpost.'
Among other things the tear festival called "O'Shaughnessy's Boy" illustrates the one dilemma which even the hardiest of the child actors cannot hope to escape. Four years ago that distinguished father and son team of Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper brought the nation to its knees in "The Champ." In the interim Master Cooper has flourished under the California sun and now he needs a child actor to impersonate him in the earlier sequences of the new film at the Capitol Theatre. There is comfort in the reflection that if we can hold out long enough even little Miss Temple will require a double to do her cooing for her."O'Shaughnessy's Boy" tells how an animal trainer in the circus loses both his nerve and his arm in the arena when his son is taken from him, and how he regains the first if not the second when he finds the lad. It is as relentless as a dentist's drill, but the Messrs. Beery and Cooper, being masters at that sort of thing, run through it very competently. Richard Boleslawsky catches the gaudy flavor of the tinsel and sawdust in accepted romantic style.A tortuous tale, it winds funereally through a whole decade in the life of Mr. O'Shaughnessy, and the photoplay makes the mistake of prolonging the grief past the saturation point. It would be doing an injustice to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, though, if I neglected to tell how these professional eyes were blurred when Stubby crawled into the Pullman berth with his dad and cried himself to sleep.I am also happy to report that it is Mr. Beery and not a double who wrestles with the tiger in the scene where his arm is torn off. When the scene was filmed last Summer the studio invited a group of film correspondents to sit among the extras in the cheering section. There were sharpshooters outside the range of the camera with their rifles trained on the tiger when Mr. Beery grappled with him and it looked every bit as dangerous as it does in the film. Spanky McFarland, the baby who plays Jackie Cooper in the earlier sequences of "O'Shaughnessy's Boy," has a hint of impishness in his character that adds spice to his usual portrait of round-eyed innocence. There is a sunny performance by Clarence Muse and a sinister one by Sarah Haden, the evil genius of the picture. O'SHAUGHNESSY'S BOY, based on a story by Harvey Gates and Malcolm Stuart Boylan; screen play by Leonard Praskins, Wanda Tuchock and Otis Garrett; musical score by Dr. William Axt; directed by Richard Boleslawski; produced for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer by Philip Goldstone.

412-> Lily Pons Makes Her Debut in 'I Dream Too Much,' at the Music Hall -- 'In Old Kentucky.'
Lily Pons makes a graceful cinema début in the pleasant if somewhat minor operatic comedy called "I Dream Too Much," which the Radio City Music Hall presented to its holiday audiences yesterday. The Gallic coloratura fortifies her brilliant singing with an engaging quality of bird-like charm and a sense of what her countrymen happily call joie de vivre. When her film threatens to perish in the languors of dramatic anemia, she rushes charmingly to the rescue with a burst of intoxicating song. Designed pretty candidly as a vehicle for Miss Pons, "I Dream Too Much" suffers from inaction and a limited sense of humor. But it is amiably managed, admirably played, and provides a reasonably painless setting for the gifted soprano.We have grown accustomed to superb musical recording in the recent films and "I Dream Too Much" is mechanically admirable. Miss Pons manages a neat compromise between grand opera and popular melody. Her classical arias are the Caro Nome from "Rigoletto" and the Bell Song from "Lakme," this latter work being staged briefly during the photoplay's account of her rise from peasant girl to distinguished diva. The Kern numbers—"Jockey on the Carrousel," "I Got Love," "I'm the Echo" and "I Dream Too Much"—are, like the film itself, agreeably unimportant.Say this much for the authors: they have worked hard to discover a fresh variation within the limits of the conventional pattern of operatic success stories. Here Miss Pons is a provincial French lass with a golden voice and a very definite urge to escape from her cramped surroundings. At the local mardi gras she meets a friendly American youth who believes that his mission in life is to compose operas. After a whirlwind courtship they are married and the lad takes his shy and eager bride to Paris with him. Anxious only for his success, she unexpectedly makes a career for herself when she bursts into an impresario's office and sings her husband's music. As she soars higher and higher in the musical firmament, he broods more bitterly over his failure. But she restores his confidence finally by getting his great opera produced as a musical comedy and persuading him that his genius is for popular music.Miss Pons has the excellent assistance of Henry Fonda, the most likable of the new crop of romantic juveniles; Osgood Perkins, as the frenetic opera impresario, and Eric Blore, the perfect comedy butler, who becomes a seal trainer for the occasion. The film introduces a musical comedy production number—on the occasion of the young composer's triumph—that looks likes something Pandro S. Berman had left over from his Fred Astaire films. I DREAM TOO MUCH, based on a story by Elsie Finn and David G. Wittels; screen play by James Gow and Edmund North; music and lyrics by Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields; directed by John Cromwell; produced for R.-K.-O. Radio by Pandro S. Berman.

Her hero, the likely Wolf Albach Retty disguised as a teacher of skiing, also does excellent work and helps keep the action moving rapidly in a not too sentimental manner. The regular comedy parts are entrusted to Richard Romanowsky as the kindly cashier and Hans Moser in the rôle of the porter of the establishment taken along at the cashier's expense. While Herr Romanowsky is practically perfect, Herr Moser is inclined to overact at times.There are high-class crooks, suspicious business men and busky mountaineers galore to complicate the funny situations. The scenes at the famous Winter resort, including Magda's adventures in the snow, are delightful. And the occasional musical numbers are catchy. There is hardly a dull moment in the whole film.

And their son (Antonio Liceaga) manages to be about the saddest boy seen so far on the Spanish-language screen. His acting, however, is more convincing than that of his elders.This picture is interesting mainly in its views of present-day Mexico.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 8. -- It is a wise saying, applicable to more things than storms and storm tracks, that the average is something that rarely happens. In books on meteorology one finds descriptions of the "typical" West India hurricane and charts showing the "typical" tracks of these disturbances.

766-> At the Palace.
Since it is generally acknowledged that the cinema is technically proficient, it is almost inconceivable that a film bearing the Warner-First National seal could so completely violate the standards of motion-picture production as does "Man of Iron " But the evidence is to be found at the Palace.Here is an example of a hackneyed story presented with a minimum of action and excessive dialogue. It is the narrative of a factory foreman whose success goes to his head and who, despite his wife's protestations, tosses caution to the four winds in his efforts to become a member of the upper social stratum. If the film has a moral, it is that a man makes himself ridiculous by allowing his ego to run wild.The new film seems to have been made solely to keep Barton MacLane in front of the camera. Though he is no matinee idol, Mr. MacLane reveals a two-fisted personality that should delight masculine audiences. Dorothy Peterson gives a straightforward, sympathetic performance as the neglected wife, while Mary Astor smiles her prettiest as a stenographer. John Eldredge, miscast as a scheming ne'er-do-well, suffers gallantly. In minor rôles you will find Joseph Sawyer and Joseph Crehan working dexterously as usual. MAN OF IRON, from a story by Dawn Powell; screen play by William WisterHaines; directed by William McGann; a First National production.Chris Bennett . . . . . Barton MacLaneVida . . . . .

--------
774-> LUMBER, THE LAMB.

--------
778-> In Washington; Collapse of Peace Move Stirs Congress Members.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19. -- Europe's statesmen may as well make up their minds that recent events in London and Paris have again widened the Atlantic, so far as Congress and the State Department are concerned. The department is realist enough to understand how such things can happen as Prime Minister Baldwin's turnabout on Sir Samuel Hoare, and to feel sufficiently confident in its own skill to continue to play the game with Europe. 
--------
779-> Drinking at Football Games.
My one recreation for several years has been to attend Saturday football games. We were promised the abolition of liquor flasks if prohibition was repealed. But today they bring quart bottles of whisky, and the women match the men and then act like fools.

790-> THE SCREEN; Barbara Stanwyck, Not to Mention Chief Thunderbird, in "Annie Oakley," at the Astor Theatre.
The cinema biography of Annie Oakley, the rifle-lady of Buffalo Bill's wild west shows, is a gaudy and pungent motion picture, smacking healthily of that obscure commodity known as tanbark. Vigorously staged and written, it is superior entertainment even when paying rather too much attention to Miss Oakley's romantic problems. Particularly when the film is describing the adventures of Chief Sitting Bull, the villain of Custer's Last Stand, amid the novel problems of the white man's civilization, it achieves a fine picaresque quality. These episodes leap out with such comic virility as to make the remainder of "Annie Oakley" seem comparatively pallid. It is here that Joel Sayre, who collaborated on the script, seems to have put in his hand, and finally released on the screen the hearty sense of humor that he revealed in "Rackety Rax."Sitting Bull, superbly played by an Indian who is billed as Chief Thunderbird, accompanies the Cody show on its travels. A grave and even surly old fellow, with just the suggestion of quiet humor about his mouth and eyes, Sitting Bull is wonderful when he comes to grips with the complexities of metropolitan life. His adventure with the Murphy bed, which folds into the wall the minute his back is turned, is hugely comical. After a careful search for the missing bed, the hero of the Little Big Horn calmly goes to sleep on the floor, after first shooting out the lights and throwing the hotel into a panic.On various other occasions, notably when he is harassed by a vengeful fellow whose brother died with Custer, the chief conducts himself with equal magnificence. But his masterpiece occurs when he spies an old friend in the audience, and pursues him into the city, brandishing a tomahawk and clad in full war regalia.Nowadays Annie Oakley's chief passport to immortality is in the theatre and circus passes which commemorate her skill with a rifle, and the photoplay dutifully reports the origin of the Annie Oakley. The Ohio backwoods girl first begins to be heard of in a large way when she participates in a local exhibition with Toby Walker, the insolent star of the Buffalo Bill show. After shooting disk for disk with the great marksman, she deliberately misses because she thinks Toby is such a pretty fellow. Buffalo Bill hires her anyway and she quickly becomes his best attraction. The story thereafter is of her rivalry with Toby, their secret love for each other, and his downfall when failing eyesight causes him to shoot the girl instead of the lighted cigarette she is holding between her teeth.The character of Toby is blurred in the writing, as he is presented alternately as a cheap braggart and a highly sympathetic lad, and this robs the love story of its proper effectiveness. Barbara Stanwyck is splendid in the title rôle; this is her most striking performance in a long time. Preston Foster plays persuasively, too, in the unrealized Toby Walker rôle, and Moroni Olsen is excellently bluff as Buffalo Bill. Chief Thunderbird, though, is the star of the picture. One scene, by the way, ought to give you a start. That is when the Kaiser, then only a Prince, gallantly, holds a cigarette in his mouth for Annie to shoot at. What might have been the course of history, you find yourself wondering, if Annie had missed. ANNIE OAKLEY, based on a story by Joseph A. Fields and Ewart Adamson; screen play by Joel Sayre and John Twist; directed by George Stevens; produced by Cliff Reid for RKO Radio. At the Astor.Annie Oakley . . . . .
