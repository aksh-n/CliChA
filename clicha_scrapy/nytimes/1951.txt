89-> Musical Fantasy From Egypt
"Little Miss Devil," a musical fantasy starring Samia Gamal, is an Egyptian film that managed, on the strength of Miss Gamal's propensity for lurid publicity, to open yesterday at the Cinema 48.It is the story of Farid El Atrache, a singer of confused values. He acquires a Jinn in the form of Miss Gamal who can accomplish everything except win the heart of Mr. Atrache. She loves him, torments him, builds him castles and theatres to display his "talent," and she dances for him. All the antics everyone goes through are only excuses for her to dance.But her dancing, while mildly sinuous, will not send the censor to his battle station. Nor does Miss Gamal save the day by acting for, alas, she is no actress. She has two expressions; toothpaste smile and sulky frown. But she has an out, for whenever she gets into trouble expressing herself, or the script gets sticky, a tom-tom thumps and she makes with the bumps.Although Miss Gamal's hips provide the only movement in an otherwise static and soggy comedy, her abdominal undulations cannot save this motion picture from being dull in the purest sense of the word. While "Little Miss Devil" might be a tasty dish in Cairo, it is certainly not anything to serve to a Western audience. LITTLE MISS DEVIL, scenario by Barakat; directed by Mohammed Ragaky; produced by Farid El Atrache. Released here by Oriental Film Company.Asfour . . . . . Farid El AtracheKahramana . . . . .

90-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; 'I'll Never Forget You,' With Tyrone Power, Ann Blyth, New Bill at the Roxy
Although there are obvious intimations of the lovely play, "Berkeley Square," in the movie "I'll Never Forget You," which came to the Roxy yesterday, there is little of its poetry or magic in this latest rendering of it on the screen. Rather there are in this remake of the famous John Balderston play, which Twentieth Century-Fox has put together in London's Denham studios, such stiff and materialistic aspects of ponderous crudity that all the fragile charm and wistful pathos of the original are crushed beneath mass. And in the role of the hero, which the late Leslie Howard performed with wondrous grace and sensitivity on the stage and in the previous film, Tyrone Power is stolid and moody, as though he had been tapped on the head.You may remember the story—of a modern-day American who, inheriting an old house in London, becomes so enamored of the past that, by some peculiar dislocation, he is transmigrated back into the eighteenth century in the shape of an ancestor and, in that age of affectation, loves and loses a long-ago girl.Well, in this retelling of the story, for which Ranald MacDougall has done the script, the gentleman's modern-day connections are brought completely up to date. He is a nuclear physicist, considerably weary and worn—and perhaps just a little radioactive—from over-work in an English lab. Thus, there's a possible suspicion that his strange difficulties with Time derive in some unexplained manner from hanging around a nuclear pile.Certainly the scientific knowledge here credited to him supports an elaboration that was not in the original play. Our hero, distressed at the ignorance and want of the eighteenth century, sets up a secret laboratory in London, where he artfully contrives working models of the camera, the steamboat, storage batteries and the incandescent bulb. And it is the discovery of these devices that brings his detractors to believe that he is, indeed, a minion of the devil and that a madhouse is the best place for him.As you can see, a disposition toward mechanical things dominates the flavor of the fantasy in this case. It also serves to angle the plot into byways of mechanistic doodling that drains much of the fanciful charm. For the rest, the humor inherent in the play's clever incongruities is heavily handled and pompously smothered in handsome period sets and costumes. The eighteenth-century phases of the story are rather conventionally photographed in under-lighted Technicolor; the modern phases are in black-and-white.In addition to Mr. Power as the changeling, the predominantly British cast includes Ann Blyth as the eighteenth-century sweetheart; Beatrice Campbell as an outraged fiancée; Irene Browne as a fluttery English mother and Michael Rennie as a modern scientist. Under the direction of Roy Baker, all of these people perform in a manner to help "I'll Never Forget You" become a thoroughly unmemorable event.On the stage at the Roxy are Carol Bruce, Jay Lawrence; André, Andrée and Bonnie, the Three Rockets and the Roxyettes. I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU, screen play by Ranald MacDougall, based on a play by John L. Balderston; directed by Roy Baker; produced by Sol C. Siegel for Twentieth Century-Fox.

881-> THE SCREEN
An incident that we fail to find recorded in the history of the War Between the States is rather vividly represented in "The Last Outpost," now on the Palace's screen. This is a daring endeavor by a Confederate cavalry troop to rescue a Federal garrison in the west from an Indian attack. And, filmed in Technicolor, with blazing arrows flying through the air and the cavalry riding hell-for-leather, a pretty endeavor it is, too.But somehow we have the feeling that nothing like this ever occurred—at least, not exactly for the reasons adduced by the writers of the script. It seems just a little bit far-fetched that a Confederate captain would jeopardize his troops to save a besieged outpost of the enemy, even though his girl was in it and his brother was in command. Things like that only happen in the movies—in Western movies—and that's what this is.However, with Ronald Reagan and Bruce Bennett playing the warring brothers in brave style; with Rhonda Fleming playing the beauteous lady and with the band playing "Dixie" for all it's worth, who's talking about American history? This is elementary school stuff, anyhow. Injuns, Soldiers, a GirlTHE LAST OUTPOST, screen play by Geoffrey Homes, George Worthing Yates and Winston Miller; directed by Lewis R. Foster; produced by William H. Pine and William C. Thomas for Paramount. At the Palace.Vance Britten . . . . . ReaganJulie McCloud . . . . . Rhonda FlemingJeb Britten . . . . . Bruce BennettSgt.

To get to the point, the adventure, which clattered into the Mayfair yesterday, is not the high point in Mr. Rooney's career, although he is facing lots of hard-bitten Mexican bandits in trying to solve the mysterious machinations of his brother. But the tired melodramatic attempts to capture "El Tigre," who, it is obvious, is Mickey's brother, is slow going laced by sporadic but unsuccessful tries at humor.As the New York tenderfoot, who is finally made aware of the fact that the scourge of the border is none other than the handsome gent he has been worshipping, Mr. Rooney is about as convincing as the Mexican sombreros he wears. On him they do not look good. However, it must be pointed out that he is energetic in his assignment.Equally muscular are Robert Preston, as the Texas Ranger who helps him in his quest, and Robert Stack, as the brother who, it appears, has become slightly demented with power. And Wanda Hendrix is decorative as the Mexican señorita both brothers desire. Mexico, it is apparent from the start, is not the place for Mr. Rooney. Rooney in MexicoMY OUTLAW BROTHER, screen play by Gene Fowler Jr., with additional dialogue by Alfred L. Levitt; based on "South of the Rio Grande" by Max Brand; directed by Elliott Nugent; a Benedict Bogeaus production released by United Artists. At the Mayfair.Denny O'More . . . . .
