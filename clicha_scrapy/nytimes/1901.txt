There are those who will remember with ourselves the not distant past when American railroads were thought so peculiarly the enemy of ail except themselves that legislation was advocated by Populists and Grangerites to curb their extortion.

277-> BOUNTIES AND TRENCH SHIPPING.
Those who believe, as many do, that all that is needed to build up a nation as a great maritime power is a sufficiently liberal system of bounties to shipbuilders and shipowners, would do well to study with some care the history of shipping bounties in France during recent years.

The arrangements for the assumption by the Post Office authorities of the telephone business of London may or may not furnish an argument in favor of the public ownership of public utilities.

307-> CONTENT WITH HORSE POWER.
CONSIDERING that nearly everybody is praising the rapid strides ahead in everything which makes for greater speed in local transit, it seems weird that there are people who live right here in New York who are opposed to it.

--------
322-> PERENNIAL SOCIALISTIC CAMPAIGN.
WITH the blare of bands and the blaze of fireworks, which died out at election time, the two old parties practically abandoned, until the next campaign, organized efforts to spread their political gospel. This is not true of the earnest believers in a co-operative Commonwealth, who mate up the Socialist Labor and Social Democratic Parties. 
--------
323-> MR. LOW WILL NAME SOME APPOINTMENTS; List of Those Possibly Chosen for Several Offices. Col. Bates May Be Deputy Police Commissioner -- Mr. Sheffield Will Probably Decline Fire Commissionership.

--------
324-> COAL SHOVELER WHO BECAME A MAYOR; A Talk with the New Chief Executive of Bridgeport, Conn.
When an overwhelming majority of the voters of a city of 75,000 inhabitants decide that for two years they wish to have as the chief, executive officer of their municipality an untutored laboring man, there must be something about that particular Individual which makes him stand out from the usual order of men. 
--------
325-> GOWNS WORN BY BRIDES AND OTHERS
THE gown worn by Miss Grace Gurnee Scott, now Mrs. George Rathbone Dyer, at her wedding a fortnight ago was noticeably elegant and simple. The sat'n used was of the heaviest, its tint was creamy, and the lace that formed the deep flounce running around the foot of the skirt and train was of exquisitely beautiful old point. 
--------
326-> REFUND OF PHILIPPINE DUTIES.; Secretary Gage Issues a Circular Letter of Instructions to Collectors.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. -- The Secretary of the Treasury to-day issued the following circular of instructions to collectors of customs regarding the refund of duties collected from imports from the Philippine Islands: 
--------
327-> THE MARKET MOVEMENT.
Though Wall Street was none the less confident of its position yesterday than on the day previous, the movement of prices on the Stock Exchange was much more irregular than on Monday, when so many substantial advances were recorded. Yesterday, in contrast, there was marked irregularity, though on the whole the general undertone was decidedly strong. 
--------

WEST POINT, N.Y., Nov. 20. -- In a game of two twenty-seven-minute halves the football team of West Point defeated the University of Pennsylvania eleven by a score of 24 to 0 here to-day.

--------
330-> POINT BREEZE OIL FIRE.
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 20 -- The fire which began yesterday afternoon at the works of the Atlantic Refining Company at Point Breeze, in the southwestern section of the city, is still burning fiercely tonight, and Chief Baxter of the city Fire Department has given up hope of saving any of the company's property. 
--------
331-> BOSTON STOCK MARKET.
BOSTON, Aug. 15. -- Money loaned at the Clearing House to-day at 3 and 4 per cent, and New York funds sold at 16 2-3 cents' discount. Exchanges, $20,544,646; balances, $2,005,864. 
--------

Hippolyte Lambert, who claims to be a naturalized American citzen and has in his possession papers certifying to that fact, arrived here yesterday on the Clyde Line steamship New York, having come by way of Santo Domingo from Central and South America. He told, after landing in Brooklyn, a thrilling story about cruelties to which he he said he had been subjected in Venezuela. 
--------
333-> POLICEMAN NOT MURDERED.; Many Witnesses Saw Patrolman Yunge Drop Dead -- Autopsy Performed.
Rumors that Policeman Peter W. Yunge of the Delancey Street Station, who died in Bellevue yesterday morning after being removed from Grand and Cannon Streets, where he had fallen, had been murdered for securing witnesses against Detective Bissert, were disposed of by Assistant District Attorney Gans, who declared that Yunge had never done any work for the District Attorney's office. 
--------
334-> MAY PREFER CHARGES AGAINST CAPT. DIAMOND; District Attorney's Office Investigating His Conduct. Case, It Is Said, Will Be Taken Direct to the Grand Jury -- Charge to be Neglect of Duty.

--------
335-> THIRD ATTACK ON AMERICAN PRESIDENTS; Lincoln and Garfield Were Victims of Assassins' Bullets.
Political assassinations have darkened the pages of the world's history from the earliest times, and under no form of government have they been more frequent than under the democratic. In this respect popular liberty and free institutions have been no guarantee of immunity for the head of the Nation. 
--------
336-> BUFFALO RATE CONCESSIONS.; Central Passenger Association Fixes Lower Schedule for Pan-American Visitors.
JAMESTOWN, N.Y., Aug. 7. -- The Central Passenger Association, embracing representatives of the leading railways east of the Mississippi River, has been in session at Lakewood, on Chautauqua Lake, to-day.

--------
337-> JULY PAYMENT ON THE TUNNEL.; Contractor McDonald's Requisition -- Total Payments, $7,067,000.
The Rapid Transit Commission yesterday held a meeting lasting about five minutes. The only thing done was to approve the July requisition of Contractor McDonald for $800,000. It was much lower than was expected. This was due to the heat during July, which made it impossible for many men to work. 
--------
338-> THE NEW TROUBADOURS.; Prof. Downer's Book on Mistral, the French Poet.
TO SAY that Mistral is the greatest living French Poet is to give him less than his due. In a delicately decadent way many little lyres are tinkling in France nowadays, and some of them very prettily; but he alone is making music that fills his own age with its melody and that surely will go ringing strongly and sweetly far down the passages of time. 
--------
339-> Article 5 -- No Title
DENVER, Sept. 6. -- Abner McKinley, who, with his wife and two daughters, left here this morning for Bailey, in South Platte Canon, in a special train over the Colorado and Southern Road, was notified late this afternoon of the shooting of the President. He at once started back for Denver. He reached here about 7:30 o'clock, and at 10 o'clock started for Chicago over the Burlington Road.

--------
341-> CHRISTMAS GIFTS FROM PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT.; Oyster Bay School Children Remembered by Him as Usual.
OYSTER BAY, L.I., Dec. 25 -- There was the usual distribution of gifts to the children of the Cove School to-day, but the familiar figure of President Roosevelt was missing. The President made it a point to make the distribution every year, no matter what else his attention was called for. 
--------
342-> THE CZAR'S VISIT TO PARIS.; Extraordinary Festivities Prepared -- Surprising Enthusiasm Shown by Republicans.
LONDON, Aug. 24 -- The excitement in France reflected in all other European countries at the prospect of the Czar's visit is scarcely understandable to the Anglo-Saxon mind. Of course, the incident is something more than merely interesting to Frenchmen as an augury of peace, but the great outburst of exultation is surprising to all but the closest students of the French national character. 
--------
343-> BOSTON STOCK MARKET.
BOSTON, Sept 6 -- Money in Boston is quite firm, without much change in rates. A moderate volume of paper is offered, quite as much as the banks care to handle. Call money is quoted at 4 to 4 1/2 per cent. Time loans, on average paper, is made around 5 per cent., with exceptional borrowers accommodated at 4 1/2 per cent. 
--------
344-> A SUNDAY OPENING SUGGESTION.
To the Editor of The New York Times: As to the Sunday opening or closing of saloons, I desire to quote as a general text these words of George Lord Lyttelton: "A wise Government will know where to yield, as well as where to resist; and there is no surer mark of littleness of mind in an administration than obstinacy in trifles. 
--------
345-> SUBMARINE BOAT LAUNCHED.; The Shark Makes a Successful Plunge at the Crescent Ship Yards.
ELIZABETHPORT, N.J., Oct. 19. -- The submarine boat Shark was successfully launched at the Crescent Shipyards this afternoon before a distinguished company.

--------
347-> GEN. A.D. HAZEN DEAD.; He Was Third Assistant Postmaster General Many Years.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. -- Gen. A.D. Hazen, who served as Third Assistant Postmaster General for many years, died last night at his home here. He was sixty-one years old. 
--------
348-> RICHARD CROKER'S STORY; He Denies that He Has Abdicated as Tammany Leader. A Reminiscence of the Turf Supplies Him with an Illustration of His Position as Defeated Chief.
Richard Croker was at the Democratic Club last evening, and he told stories about the peculiarities of race horses. He also denied the report that he would go abroad before the holidays, and that John F. Carroll would take his place as the leader of Tammany Hall. 
--------
349-> AMERICA'S DEBTS ABROAD.; Secretary Gage Comments on The London Times's Assertion Concerning This Country's Obligations.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. -- Secretary Gage does not consider it a matter of great moment whether The London Times is right or wrong in saying the United States is still a debtor Nation in spite of the country's enormous wealth and its great trade balances. Referring to the matter in an interview to-day the Secretary said: 
--------
350-> NO SMALLPOX IN TRENTON.; One City Without a Case in a Year -- Many Die of Cancer In New Jersey.

--------
351-> U. OF PENN., 6; F. AND M., 0.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 2. -- The University of Pennsylvania football eleven had difficulty to-day in defeating the Franklin and Marshall team on Franklin Field, winning by the narrow margin of six points to none. Pennsylvania's greatest fault was her slowness in getting off her plays. The visiting team was about as heavy as the home eleven, and was able to withstand the rather weak onslaughts of the Pennsylvanians. 
--------
352-> BIG GAME.; Mr. Wallihan's Camera Shots -- Mr. Roosevelt's Introduction to the Volume.*
NO MORE beautiful gift book for man or boy could have been devised than Doubleday, Page  Co. have magnificently made of Mr. Wallihan's photographic pictures of the game of the Rocky Mountains. 
--------
353-> "THE MERCHANT OF VENICE."; Sir Henry Irving and Miss Ellen Terry in Shakespeare's Comedy.
Sir Henry Irving and Miss Ellen Terry acted together last night at the Knickerbocker Theatre in Shakespeare's comedy "The Merchant of Venice." This statement must be followed closely by the corrollary that the house was filled and that the progress of the performance was observed with delight and acclaimed with ap- plause. 
--------
354-> REIFF'S RIDE DEFENDED.
LONDON, Oct. 2. -- The action of the Stewards of the Jockey Club in revoking the license of the popular and successful American jockey, Lester Reiff, caused intense surprise among turfmen, both English and American, but none was more surprised than Reiff himself. Speaking of the edict of the Jockey Club to-day, Reiff said: 
--------
355-> STRENGTHENING THE NAVY.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 -- In addition to the four warships which Congress has directed him to prepare plans for, as a basis for appropriation at the next session of Congress, Secretary Long has before him the recommendations of the Board of Naval Construction, looking to authorization by Congress of the building of forty more naval vessels of all classes, from battleships down to tugboats. 
--------
356-> PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S COFFIN.; It Was Made in Oneida, N.Y., and Is of Special Design.
BUFFALO, Sept. 14. WILLIAM McKINLEY. Born January 29th, 1843. Died September 14th, 1901. The foregoing is the inscription on the coffin that will contain the remains of the martyred President.

--------

358-> RELIEF AT HAND FOR THE TUNNEL NUISANCE; Mr. Wheeler Says the Company Must Substitute Electricity. Work Must Begin in Thirty Days or a Mandamus May Be Obtained -- Vast Rapid Transit Scheme Outlined.

--------
359-> Draw Poker.
The New York Times Saturday Review of Books: I am deeply impressed with a sense of the favor that has been done to me in the review of my work on "The Science of Draw Poker," but after the manner of thin-skinned authors, I am impelled to register a protest on one or two points. 
--------
360-> MARKET MOVEMENT.
The movement of prices in the stock market yesterday reflected nothing more nor less than the operations of professionals and traders, and hence it was that, as on the day previous, marked irregularity appeared, some issues declining while others advanced. It was a market, in short, so altogether irregular that even shrewd traders who ventured in found themselves whipsawed. 
--------
361-> A SICK PRISONER FLOGGED.; Sheriff in Dover, Del., Obeyed the Law, but Laid the Lash on Lightly.
DOVER, Del., Nov. 9 -- Sheriff Frank Reedy performed a most unpleasant task to-day in the public flogging of William H. Decker, horse thief. Decker has been ill, and is subject to violent attacks of heart trouble. 
--------
362-> Mimicry in Savages.
From The International Monthly. When, writes a missionary of the tribes of the remote part of Victoria, a native is able to imitate the peculiarities of some absent member of the tribe, it is very common to hear all in the camp convulsed with laughter. The Indians of Brazil hold the peculiarities (the beard, for example) of other tribes up to laughter in the shape of a lively pantomime. 
--------
363-> ARMY EMERGENCY RATIONS; Official Report of Tests Made with Soldiers in the Field. Board of Officers Develops Prepared Food that Is Wholesome and Nu- tritious -- Other Experiments Fail.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 -- Appended to the annual report of Commissioner, General Weston, which was made public to-day, is an account of the proceedings of a board of officers convened to report on a new emergency ration and of the way in which, after selecting it, they tried it on a detachment of soldiers ordered out for the purpose. 
--------
364-> HONORS TO BE PAID TO M'KINLEY'S MEMORY; Street Cars, Railroads, and Telegraphs Will Stop. BUSINESS HOUSES TO CLOSE Games and Festivities Postponed -- Theatres Not to Open -- No Band Concerts.
To-day in New York will be given over to observances honoring the memory of President William McKinley. In all city churches there will be services. Mr. McKinley will be the subject of eulogy, and in many cases his favorite hymns will be features of the musical services. There will be no distinction as to denominations or creeds in these observances. 
--------
365-> FRANCE IS PREPARING FOR THE CZAR'S VISIT; Paris Hopes He Will Consent to Spend a Few Hours There. Elaborate Measures to Guard Him -- People of Dunkirk and Compiegne Reaping a Harvest.
PARIS, Aug. 31. -- As the day set for the arrival of the Czar in France approaches interest in his Majesty's visit is quickening into excitement. The newspapers are devoting columns daily to the various arrangements under way. 
--------
366-> THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CIVIL SERVICE.
The annual report of the United States Civil Service Commission is interesting, but not exactly pleasant, reading. 
--------
367-> SHAMROCK II.'S MANAGER HERE; W.G. Jameson Thinks the New Challenger the Best Boat He Ever Saw.
On board the Cunard Line steamship Campania, which arrived at this port on Friday night and came up to her pier yesterday morning, was W.G. Jameson, the amateur yachtsman, who will manage the Shamrock II. in her races for the America's Cup. The Campania, in honor of her passenger, set the Shamrock, flag on her spring stay. 
--------
368-> FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE.
To the Editor of The New York Times: To judge from an article in to-day's TIMES entitled "Not Good for the Cause," it can plainly be seen that the chances are very slim, indeed, for union and harmony in the ranks of anti-Tammany voters. The Republicans would like to have a good Republican nominated, and the anti-Tammany Democrats want a Democrat. 
--------
369-> Mr. Hays as World's Fair Director.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Aug. 20 -- Immediately upon the resignation of Charles M. Hays as President and General Manager of the Southern Pacific Railroad he was mentioned as possible Director General of the World's Pair here. Mr. Hays is a former St. Louis man. He was connected with the Wabash Railroad in this city as General Manager for a number of years. 
--------
370-> A Juggle of Corpses.*
You are not expected by the author of "L19,000" to be in the least worried about the fate of the personages in his story. You are to take pleasure in his ingenuity, and nothing more. The inclination is to laugh. It is so infinitely ludicrous to mix up the bodies of two dead men in the cabin of a steamer. 
--------
371-> Suggests John P. Faure for Mayor.
To the Editor of The New York Times: Allow me to call your attention, for Mayor of Greater New York, to Mr. John P. Faure, former Commissioner of Charities and member of the School Board, a philanthropist, by whose extraordinary efforts 40,000 poor women and children, through St. John's Guild, have been permitted to get fresh air and be restored to health. 
--------
372-> TO RESUME, SAYS PHILLIPS.; He Blames His Bookkeepers for Suspension of the Chicago Corn Brokerage Firm.
CHICAGO, Aug. 2 -- George H. Phillips, the corn speculator, gave out a statement to-day, in which he says that the George H.

--------
373-> PREPARING TO CHECK RUSSIAN AGGRESSION; Belief that Great Britain Means to Adopt a Firm Policy. Blue Books Dealing with Russia's Proceedings in Various Quarters Regarded as Indicating This.
LONDON, Aug. 31. -- Russian agents in Persia are interfering with the QuettaNushki trade route, between India and Eastern Persia, opened by the Indian Government. 
--------
374-> A Tennessee Romance.*
It would be unfair to Mr. John Trotwood Moore to assert that he was no lover of nature and that "A Summer Hymnal, a Tennessee Romance," was the outcome of a realizing sense that the public mind was attuned to a cordial reception of birds and books. "The Summer Hymnal" may have been the sincerest outpourings of the author's heart, but the manner of the outpouring is unfortunate. 
--------
375-> WHAT IS DOING IN SOCIETY.
Few well-known people were seen in the city yesterday, although, as a rule, Friday is a favorite day for coming to town. Mrs. Hildreth K. Bloodgood passed through and Mrs. Frederick Esler, who has just returned from a recent trip abroad, lunched in the palm garden. Mrs. Wilbur Bloodgood was also in town on a shopping expedition. 
--------
376-> THE MARSEILLES COAL TRADE.; British Consul Says Americans Are Trying to Obtain a Monopoly.
LONDON, Aug. 8. -- The British Consular report regarding trade at Marseilles, issued yesterday, asserts that the most vital recent development, from a British point of view, is the determined attempt of Americans to obtain a monopoly of the coal imports at that port. 
--------
377-> ART NOTES.
The St. Louis Exposition of 1903 has begun preparations early, but none too early, by appointing certain important Directors. F. Wellington Ruckstuhl having been made Director of Sculpture, a General Director of Art has now been added in the person of Halsey C. Ives, manager of the local Art Museum, who was favorably known for his services at the Chicago World's Fair. 
--------
378-> THE MILBURN HOME.
BUFFALO, Sept. 6. -- The Milburn home is on the west side of Delaware Avenue, the second house north of Ferry Street. It is a three-story dark-green brick structure of wide dimensions. It is about sixty feet from the street line, a well-kept lawn sloping to the sidewalk. A strip of lawn, a hedge, and then a driveway separate the house on the south. 
--------
379-> SHOPPING DISTRICT FIRE; A Sixth Avenue Building Quickly Consumed by Flames. Spectacular Effect of a Half-Masted Flag Blazing Aloft -- Heavy Loss of Furniture Dealers.
Early travelers in Sixth Avenue yesterday witnessed one of the fiercest fires that ever occurred in the retail shopping district when the four-story building 237 to 245 Sixth Avenue and 109 West Fifteenth Street, forming an "L" around the seven-story carpet and furniture store of S. Baumann  Co. at that corner, was destroyed. 
--------
380-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- Without pretending to be deeply grieved over the ugly and inconvenient Christmas present which Mr. EDGAR STANTON MACLAY, special laborer, has received from his official chief, we do regard as entirely natural, and lo that extent sympathize with, the surprise he manifests at finding himself, a lonely victim among the Sampsonian cohorts, selected for reproval and punishment. 
--------
381-> JONES TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF.; Valet Accused of Murdering His Employer, W. M. Rice, Twice Tried to Commit Suicide.
News was received at the District Attorney's office yesterday of two desperate attempts to commit suicide made Tuesday night by Charles F. Jones, valet to W. M. Rice, and one of the alleged conspirators in the murder of his employer. Jones, since the hearing in the forgery case of Lawyer Patrick, his alleged partner in the crime, has been confined at 200 West Forty-fourth Street, a private sanitarium.

--------
383-> COLD WAVE USHERED IN BY FIERCE NORTHWESTER; Wind Blusters About the City at Sixty-four Miles an Hour Rate. Plays Pranks with Shivering Pedestrians, Telegraph Wires, and the Signs on Buildings.
The predictions of the men who at the behest of the Government of the United States manipulate the weather hereabout, that yesterday was going to be a grand combination of gale and ice, was fulfilled to the letter. Early in the morning the rain was still falling, but it was a different kind of rain from the unpleasant misty affair that made life in the metropolis so miserable Saturday. 
--------
384-> STIRRING DEBATE IN EPISCOPAL CONVENTION; Alteration of Prayer Book by Bishops Allowed. Presiding Bishop to be Elected to Serve Three Years -- Auxiliary Organizations Meet.
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 7 -- This was a day of oratory in the House of Deputies of the triennial Episcopal Convention. The debate, which began last Saturday on the proposed addition to Article X. of the Constitution, prescribing the form of worship, was continued all day, and resulted in its adoption. As adopted it is as follows: 
--------

--------
386-> CAPT. GANNON ON THE STAND.; He Is Examined as a Witness in the Case of the Webster Hotel.
Capt.

--------
387-> MR. SHEPARD STANDS UPON HIS RECORD; Retracts No Word He Uttered Against Corruption. PLEDGED TO POLICE REFORM Mayoralty Candidate Defends Democ racy in Accepting His Nomination -- Sumptuary Legislation He Condemns, with Tilden -- His Opponent's Position Partisan, He Affirms.
Edward M. Shepard announced his campaign principles and made his pledges to the voters in an address delivered last evening to the Notification Committee of the Democratic City Convention, when he formally accepted the nomination for Mayor. There was little formality about the proceedings. 
--------
388-> "Up and Down the Sands of Gold."*
Two successive essays in one field are not expected of the young novelist of to-day, and it was to be foreseen that Miss Mary Devereux, having told her pretty story of the Revolution with its ingenious introduction, would make "Up and Down the Sands of Gold" as unlike "From Kingdom to Colony" as possible. 
--------
389-> THE MAYFLOWER'S MEMORY; Descendants of That Historic Ship's Company at a Banquet. Assistant Attorney General Beck Pays Tribute to Living and Martyred Presidents -- Russell Sage and Miss Gould Attract Attention.
Russell Sage and Miss Helen M. Gould sat side by side at the seventh annual banquet of the Society of Mayflower Descendants at Delmonico's last night. Throughout the elaborate dinner and the speaking that followed and until the Sage-Gould party departed, the aged financier paid marked attention to Miss Gould. 
--------
390-> Letters from the Early Presidents and their Wives.
The October issue of the Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, published quarterly by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, contains a number of letters selected from rare originals in the possession of that society, few if any of which have ever been given to the public. These letters have been chosen to illustrate, as far as possible, the characteristics of their writers, and the social aspects of their day. 
--------
391-> LEAGUE BASEBALL GAMES; New Yorks Were Again Beaten by the Philadelphias. BROOKLYN LOSES TO BOSTON Al Maul, the Pitcher, Signed by New York -- Pittsburg Broke Even -- St. Louis Won.
The same cause may be ascribed for the defeat of the New York baseball team yesterday at the Polo Grounds as has been advanced on numerous other occasions this year, and that is lack of hitting when hitting means something more than reaching first base, for with men on bases the New Yorks seemed to be unable to solve the pitching of Donahue. 
--------
392-> THE BALANCE OF TRADE.
To the Editor of The New York Times: Senator Depew is an amusing individual, and he is always most amusing when he means to be serious. Returning home recently, he proclaims joyfully that our manufactures are capturing foreign markets so fast that the countries of Europe may be driven to an actual war of self-defense, though he hopes that such an awful result may be averted. 
--------
393-> BACHELOR APARTMENTS ARE NOT TENEMENTS.; Magistrate Pool Decides a Novel Point of Law -- A Bachelor Is Not a Family.
"Are Bachelor Apartment Houses Tenements ?" was the question which Magistrate Pool was called upon to decide in the Jefferson Market Court yesterday afternoon, and, after listening to the arguments of the attorneys on both sides for an hour, he came to the conclusion that they are not.

NEW HAVEN, Conn., Nov. 21 -- President John M. Hall of the New York and New Haven Road said at midnight: 
--------
396-> The Contributor's Right to Courtesy.
As this article must for obvious reasons be pseudonymous it seems fitting that the writer should by way of beginning give some idea of the experience upon which it is founded, lest any of its statements be met with the retort that he is exceeding his actual knowledge, or, to use the phrase of the street, "talking through his hat." 
--------
397-> DOGS AND CITY ORDINANCES.
To the Editor of The New York Times: Your prompt response to a simple request for the publication of the city ordinance which prohibits dogs at large without leash or leader commanded my most cordial appreciation, so it is with some surprise that I read in this morning's issue of THE TIMES your comment on the same coupled with your reflections upon the law itself, which "our correspondent persuaded us to print." 
--------
398-> MR. STEDMAN.; Recollections of His Early Newspaper Days from "R.H.S."
BY some caprice of the Post Office, blunder exceeding blunder in the delivery of certain writings of mine intended for the eyes of professional friends, and manuscripts of a larger nature, consisting of written and printed matter designed for publication, I was unable to forward to you the continuation of my off-hand thoughts about Mr. Stedman suggested by the article reprinted from your SATURDAY REVIEW in "American Authors and Their Homes."

In the United Gas Improvement and Choctaw common there were sharp declines, but the Readings went above yesterday's highest figures. 
--------

--------
404-> WAR FOR CONGRESS SEAT; No Truce in the Battle in the Seventh District. CROKER-BELMONT DISPUTE Mr. Croker Says He Interfered for the Candidate's Good -- Mr. Belmont Threatens Suit -- Fight for a Place on the Ballot.
There was no truce in the Seventh Congressional District fight yesterday.

--------
405-> OUTSIDE SECURITIES.

--------
407-> CLOSES TENDERLOIN GAMBLING RESORTS.; Mysterious Order Stops Numerous Christmas Feasts -- Capt. Sheehan, Too, Sends His Detectives Raiding.
One of those mysterious messages which are never discussed by policemen swept through the Tenderloin district yesterday afternoon, and the nine finest gambling houses in New York, with the exception of Canfield's place, closed their doors to all comers. 
--------
408-> MARKET MOVEMENT.
Yesterday's market was narrow but strong, a reaction just at the close not much disturbing the general movement. The market's tendency is, however, to harden rather than to advance materially. Throughout the whole list there seems to be steady absorption. Commission houses do not report increased orders, but they agree that clients are alert, and will be ready to join in any betterment that promises headway. 
--------
409-> ONE REWARD OF HONESTY.
"OF course I believe that honesty is the best policy," said the young man who smokes. "It is a rule of ethics that if I find anything lying around loose it is my duty to restore it to the owner, whenever possible. I used to observe that principle religiously, but I doubt if I should now be so conscientious. 
--------
410-> NOT A QUESTION OF PARTY.
To the Editor of The New York Times: I have read with sorrow and surprise the letters of some of your correspondents summoning us to follow Mr. Shepard into the Tammany camp. We might "Walk backward with averted gaze To hide the shame." did we not believe in his entire sincerity; we may pity him for his coming disillusionment; but follow him we may not. 
--------
411-> ILLINOIS CENTRAL.; Considering Some Criticisms of Its New Stock Issue.
An important corporation event of the past week -- on Wednesday last -- appeared in the action of the stockholders of the Illinois Central Railroad Company, who at their annual meeting approved the recommendation of their Board of Directors, that the company's share capital be increased from 600,000 shares to 792,000 shares, the increase, of course, representing $13,200,000 added to the outstanding volume of capital stock.

--------
413-> TWO FRIENDS OF THE SOUTH.
The Southern papers are not well advised in their severe criticism of the President for inviting Dr. BOOKER WASHINGTON to dinner at the White House. There sat down together on that occasion two gentlemen, one white and the other colored, who are two of the truest Americans born on our soil, and two of the best and most intelligent and influential friends of the South now living.

--------
415-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- Superintendents and Principals of the Chicago public schools are much disturbed over a charge by one of their number that they and their teachers use "frightfully" inaccurate language in the class room. He objects especially to such locutions as "Take three from eleven and eight remains."

418-> OUR LONDON CABLE; How the Treasury Managed the Money Market. Unruffled in Spite of a Payment of 15 Per Cent, on the New Consols -- The Market, However, Is Only Easy Superficially -- Exports of Gold Now Seem Inevitable Owing to the Excess of Imports Over Exports.
LONDON, Oct. 12 -- Our Treasury is managing the money market with an adroitness that is almost equal to that of your Mr. Gage. An installment of 15 per cent, fell due on our new consols last Thursday and required fully L4,000,000 to meet it, allowing for the amount of stock already paid up in full. 
--------
419-> RARE SPECIMENS FROM THE FAR EAST.; Prof. Dean Returns with Examples of Fish and Animals -- Wonderful Objects from Japan and the Philippines.

--------
420-> THE WEST AND BANKING.
The study of the science of banking, with a view to adapting present methods to the extensive changes now going on rapidly in the business of the country, is, we think, more steadily and vigorously pursued in the West than it is in what we are fond of regarding as the financial centre of the country. 
--------
421-> PITTSBURG ESCAPES A FLOOD.; Only the Sudden Fall in Temperature Averts a Destructive Overflow from the Swollen Rivers.
PITTSBURG, Penn., Dec. 15. -- "One of the greatest floods in the history of Pittsburg was averted only by the sudden drop in the temperature. The rise at the headwater of the Allegheny and Monongahela' Rivers was about stopped at midnight, and the rivers will likely slowly recede." 
--------
422-> Bronx Park Squirels
THERE are many reasons why we are on better terms with the squirrels than with most of our other wild creatures, and perhaps the principal reason is that they are among the very few that will allow us to become acquainted with them. In the first place most of the others are nocturnal in their habits, and few earn to take the trouble to call on them in the dark. 
--------
423-> ROSLYN LIBRARY'S RARE BOOKS; Mrs. Clarence Mackay Unearthed Them While Making Improvements.
HOSLYN, L.I., Nov. 17. -- Mrs. Clarence Mackay has almost doubled in size and greatly improved the William Cullen Bryant Library of this village.

--------
424-> HISTORY AND FICTION.
Doubtless few persons trouble themselves about the number of books published in a year, or the kinds. It might, however, be instructive to such persons to inquire what classes of works of literature seem to be the most popular. No one would hesitate to accord the leading place to fiction, for it is an undeniable fact that the great majority of readers read for amusement and not for information. 
--------
425-> YONKERS POLICE CAPTURE 240 PRISONERS IN A RAID.; Descend Upon an Alleged Pool Room in the Manhattan Hotel.
YONKERS, N.Y., Dec. 21. -- Late this afternoon the police raided an alleged poolroom at 7 Warburton Avenue, known as the Manhattan Hotel. About 240 men and boys, including the proprietor, were arrested. Among the prisoners were eight men who said they were New York policemen.

--------
430-> MUTUAL DISCLAIMERS.
CROKER must disclaim SHEPARD and SHEPARD must disclaim CROKER. Each must repudiate the other with emphasis and specification. That is the only way in which both can fool the people, as both are trying to fool the people in this campaign. 
--------
431-> THE PROCEEDINGS IN COURT.; Steps In the First Day of Czolgosz's Trial -- Counsel for the Defense Define Their Position.
BUFFALO, Sept. 23 -- Long before the trial of Czolgosz began the streets in the vicinity of City Hall were the objective of many curious persons. They were willing to take chances on being admitted to the courtroom, even though they knew that there were but 150 seats available.

--------
433-> RUSSIAN RIVER TRAVEL.; Voyaging Down the Shilka Is Not Much Like a Trip on the Hudson Day Line.
I went to the boat office to book a berth in the post packet. It was closed. The next day I went. It was open, but nobody aside. I waited one hour. At last in came t heavily whiskered man. Could I engage i place on the post boat? He didn't know, because he had not anything to do with it. But the manager would come in an hour or two if I would wait. 
--------
434-> HORSE SHOW, WEDDING, AND OTHER GOWNS
MRS. JOHN JACOB ASTOR wore black and white at the Horse Show. Her costume of the first day was described on Tuesday. Wednesday evening she was in an exquisite sown of black and white striped silk gauze over white taffein. The stripes were a quarter of an inch wide. The frock was simply made.

--------
436-> VACCINE, ANTITOXINS, AND THE HEALTH BOARD.
To the Editor of The New fork Times: Of course, I fully expected that the bacteriological bureaus would find a champion, and who more fitting than Dr. A.N. Bell of Brooklyn, who is himself or has been associated very intimately with the system that I condemn? Has he not been a little premature? 
--------
437-> CUT CONVENTION OF THE CITIZENS' UNION; No Serious Opposition to Mr. Low Is Expected.
The City Convention of the Citizens' Union will assemble at Cooper Union tonight. George Haven Putnam will preside. Officers of the union do not expect serious opposition to the nomination of Seth Low for Mayor. 
--------
438-> FOREIGN LANGUAGES IN THE SCHOOLS.
One plank of the platform constructed by Mr. HERMAN RIDDER for Mr. Low seems to represent only the builder's personal views of what is desirable. It is that which requires that Mr. Low shall "give pledges about the teaching of one other language besides English in the public schools." 
--------
439-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD; Dealings Confined to Small Properties -- The Day's Sales by Brokers and at Auction.

--------
444-> GERMANY'S NEW TARIFF BILL.; Organ of the Centrists Says That Party Will Support the Measure Substantially in Its Present Form.
BERLIN, Aug. 3. -- The Tariff bill continues to be discussed in a lively manner. It is generally recognized that much depends upon the attitude of the South German Cabinets, and, during the last few days the semi-official utterances there have taken the cue of The North German Gazette, that the bill is only tentative. But it is regarded as certain that South German officials desire many changes. 
--------

--------
447-> TRUSTS AND PUBLICITY.
The discussion of trusts by Mr. JAMES B. DILL of this city at Chicago on Saturday evening has a special interest from the well-known ability of that gentleman in the line of practice connected with this class of corporations and his wide experience.

--------
450-> JOHN KEATS.; The Present Popularity of the Poet Demonstrated.

--------
451-> IN MEMORY OF DR. BROWN.; Bust Unveiled at St. Thomas's Church -- Tributes to the Late Rector.

--------
452-> STRENGTH OF A BRIDGE; An Explaination, Without Mathematics, as to How It Is Calculated.
IT is the habit of the public to accept without question the conclusions of qualified and reputable experts on every subject which is necessarily outside of popular knowledge. The engineer builds a bridge and the people cross it with rarely a thought as to its stability. They assume that it is strong enough for the purpose for which it is designed. 
--------
453-> SENATOR PLANT SILENT ON THE SUNDAY QUESTION; Declines to Discuss the Proposition for Open Saloons. The Idea Is Regarded with Favor at the German Clubs -- Views of Herman Ridder and William H. Klenke.

469-> The Cows of New York
"WHENEVER the dairy business of New York State is mentioned the average New Yorker associates it in his mind simply with the keepins up of the milk supply for this city," said a dealer in dairy products.

--------
470-> The Flummery of College Caps and Gowns.
By way of such explanation as may avert confusion of mind. The Springfield Republican has thought it well, in its issue of Oct. 20, to devote half a column of space to an explanation of the meaning of academic costumes, in the matter of stuffs, colors, forms, facings, linings, and the like.

The author of "The Man With the Hoe" has put forth another volume of versus, of which the title, "Lincoln," is taken from the poem read at the New York Republican Club's Lincoln birthday dinner last year.

A charming book of verses entitled "Anni Fugaces," has come from the pen of no less a personage than our old friend, R.C. Lehmann.

Yesterday was singularly impressive. Here, in the great city which is the centre of so much of the activity of the country, and of other countries, a more than Sabbath stillness, a peculiar hush, indefinable, sympathetic, universal, prevailed.

SEVERAL weeks ago I happened to visit the interesting Dom Museum at Riga, the capital of Livonia, and noticed a unique example of northern architecture, in the shape of a Norman capital.

ORANGE, N.J., Sept. 19. -- Never has there been such an expression of sympathy as was shown in Orange to-day.

--------
597-> THE TAMPA INCIDENT.
The method of the people of Tampa, Fla., in dealing with strike organizers and labor agitators is original and interesting. Eighteen leaders of a local cigarmakers' union have been rounded up and conveyed to parts unknown. The same fate has overtaken the editor of a paper printed in Spanish which made itself unpopular by inciting the cigarmakers to quarrel with their employers. 
--------
598-> THE CRIME AND ITS EFFECT.
It is one of the elements of wanton atrocity in the crime attempted upon the President that, had it been successful. It would and could have made no change of importance in the course of the National life. Had the desire of the assailant been to secure a change in the Government, it would have been absolutely futile, and must have been known to be so to any person of even low intelligence. 
--------

--------
602-> Mr. Arnold's Profits on His Books.
William Harris Arnold's recent "Record of Books and Letters," which gives the cost and selling prices of the books in his second sale, is more interesting than the "Record" of his first auction.

--------
603-> CITY RECORD'S BIDS UNDER SUSPICION; GranD Jury May Be Asked to Investigate Them. Mr. Philbin Declares He Has Proof Sufficient to Warrant His Successor in Taking Summary Action.
One of the branches under the present city administration may have its methods investigated by the Grand Jury.

609-> LATEST BOOKS.; Mr. Brownell's "French Art."*

610-> Cyprus and Palestine.; HISTORY AND TRAVEL. HISTORY AND TRAVEL. HISTORY AND TRAVEL.
Evidently the time anticipated by J.K. Stephen when "the Haggards ride no more," has not yet arrived, for only last year the popular South African novelist was engaged on a considerable pilgrimage.

--------
617-> New Studies in Work.*
Of the permanent value of Mr. Wyckoff's self-sacrificing study of the laborer and the labor problem there are a variety of opinions. His own frank admission is that "scarcely a generalization with the least claim to value can be drawn from my superficial contact with the world of labor in America," leads to the query whether his study has been a mere quixotic windmill encounter, ending fn confessed failure. 
--------
618-> NEED OF DRINKING FOUNTAINS.
To the Editor of The New York Times: A few years ago I resided on the west side, up in the nineties, and having been unwell, and consequently compelled to relinquish busines for over a year, I occasionally took long walks on the Boulevard and Riverside Drive.

How to Americanize the French Canadian who swarms the streets of the New England cotton towns; how to break up those voluntary Ghettos formed by the strange tongue, the strange customs, and a people willing to forget neither -- this is to-day a serious problem.

651-> The Speculation in Wheat

LONDON, Oct. 26. -- Money was firm today, and discounts were strong on gold exports, the opinion of the moment being that this is only the beginning and that it necessitates an almost immediate advance of the bank rate.

Copyright, 1901. LONDON, Oct. 5. -- The Autumn political term has begun with a flood of speechmaking, of which, however, there has been rather too much all through the long vacation.

728-> THE TROUBLES IN COLOMBIA.
Our position at Colon is interesting and delicate. As between the Colombian Government and its citizens who are in revolt against it we must be and are strictly neutral.

--------
729-> TRADES UNIONS AND STRIKES.
To the Editor of The New York Times: It has been my contention for years that the solution of the trades union and strike problems is to be found in the scattering of industries. Where there are many large manufacturing establishments situated in a single city, opportunity is afforded for trades union agitators to prosecute their work of organizing quietly, effectively, and perhaps for a time unnoticed.

731-> The Chimes of New York; and Their Ringers.
HE would not be a true New Yorker who has not pone on a New Year's night to hear the chimes of Old Trinity Church.

--------
749-> Maxwell Gray's "Every-day Romance."
There is a promise about "Four-Leaved Clover" that warms the cockles of the heart of a jaded reviewer. That the pages in large, clear type, well spaced, should fall short of three hundred instead of running in small and compact characters well over the four hundred is in itself cheering. Then a modern " Every-day Romance" -- what a blessed relief!

--------
757-> Peculiarities of Sound.
From The Nineteenth Century. Signals made by sounds of explosion are not the most reliable. Their penetration is obviously often uncertain, while their duration being brief, they may be missed by momentary inattention. The reed horn was the more efficient instrument as compared with gun-cotton cartridges over London. 
--------
758-> MERITS OF THE SUNDAY LAW.
To the Editor of The New York Times: Criticisms that have been made in regard to the law which prohibits the opening of meat markets on Sunday, wherein it has been asserted that the law is burdensome and unjust to the poorer classes, move me to present the other side of the question.

761-> THE CZAR'S VISIT TO FRANCE.
All the capitals of Europe are just now more or less excited over the visit of the Czar of Russia to witness the Autumn manoeuvres in Prance and to meet President LOUBET.

--------
762-> The Grammar of Modern Novelists.
The New York Times Saturday Review of Books: One doubtless cannot expect that the writers of our latter-day popular novels should possess anything which could fairly be called literary style, or that they should pay much atttention to the subtier points of good writing; but is it unreasonable to demand that they shall at least observe the simpler rules of grammar? 
--------
763-> BELIEVES IN GOING TO CHURCH.
To the Editor of The New York Times: In my letter of Aug. 24, my reason given why church services are so poorly attended in Summer was that many of the members possessed the idea that there was no harm in using the Lord's day for their own pleasure; their plea for so doing being that they need the fresh air.

771-> Teaching the Word of God.*
So far we have known Mr. Frank T. Bullen as the writer of short sailor's yarns, all with a peculiar flavor of Jollity. Careless Jaok was his hero.

--------
773-> BALTIMORE STOCK DEALINGS.
BALTIMORE, Md., Nov. 26 -- The market to-day was dull to an extreme, with the tone sufficiently easy to admit of a number of fractional recessions without any very big decline being suffered.

--------
774-> THE LONDON MARKET.
LONDON, Aug. 14. -- There was no special demand for money to-day, and discounts were easy.

775-> Golf Storie
A second series of golf stories is welcome from Mr. Van Tassel Sutphen, drawn to these stories as we are by the recollection of pleasant hours spent with the first series.

BAR HARBOR, Me., Aug. 14. -- The finest golf of the season was brought out in the first and semi-final rounds of the annual open tournament here to-day.

--------
779-> The Duck-Hawk's Strategy.
From St. Nicholas. It is exciting to watch the duck hawk in pursuit of his prey. Given an open field with the quarry, it is astonishing to witness the exhibition of speed by these "thoroughbred" racers. The hawk will often overtake and strike a duck in the air, though he seems to prefer to single out one from some flock, and, if possible, force him to dive.

For a while it seemed as if there were to be a close match at the St. Nicholas Rink last night in the international hockey game between the Victoria Club of Montreal and the St. Nicholas seven of this city. But the local team after a temporary lead suddenly went to pieces, and was defeated in easy fashion by the visitors by a score of, 8 -- 3. 
--------
784-> MONEY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION.
To the Editor of The New York Times: The sentiments expressed in your leader, "The C.C.N.Y.," this morning, are sufficiently startling to warrant a reply.

--------
785-> RUSSIA IN MANCHURIA.

--------
786-> THE CONDITION OF THE STREETS.
Commissioner NAGLE of the Department of Street Cleaning is very unhappy. If he wanted to sleep o' nights he could not.

--------
787-> SOCIETY AT HOME AND ABROAD
For the past week New York has been gay, quite out of the average.

--------
796-> She Would Smuggle.
Many women seem peculiarly unable to appreciate the immorality of smuggling and bribing and to understand that it is as great a crime to swindle the Government as it is to swindle one's neighbor. Not long ago a gentleman and his wife went to Europe for an extended trip. The wife announced before going that she intended to lay in a stock of laces in Europe that would last her the remainder of her life.

The first of a series of formal "at homes" given by Edward M. Shepard, the Democratic candidate for Mayor, to reporters of political news took place yesterday afternoon at the home of Mr. Shepard's sister, Mrs. Hewitt, 182 Congress Street. So far as Mr. Shepard could make it so, the occasion was purely a social one. 
--------
884-> MR. CHOATE ARRAIGNED BEFORE THE LOTOS CLUB; Pleads Guilty to Intense Joy at Being Home Again.
"The Lotos Club vs. Joseph H. Choate," was the formal looking document, wrapped in a legal blue cover and tied with a legal red string that stared the American Ambassador to England in the face when he took his place as the guest of honor at the Lotos Club dinner last night. It was the menu. 
--------
885-> VAUDEVILLE AT BAR HARBOR.; Summer Visitors Give an Entertainment at the Marlborough.
BAR HARBOR, Me., Sept. 3 -- Society people doing vaudeville turns made the affair given at the Marlborough to-night the most unique of the season.

--------
886-> STANDARD OIL'S NEW SITE.; Distributing Station to be Built on Bank of Westchester Creek.
Residents and property owners in that section of the Borough of the Bronx lying east of the Bronx River have been considerably disturbed recently by reports that the Standard Oil Company had acquired a large tract on Westchester Creek.

CHICAGO, Aug. 15. -- Thirty-five cents discount was the New York exchange rate to-day. Interest charges for call and time loans were unchanged at 4%@5 per cent. 
--------
888-> OUTSIDE SECURITIES.
More business was transacted in the outside market yesterday than on any Saturday for some weeks past. Not many stocks, however, shared this activity, the bulk of the day's trading being supplied by three or four issues. Some substantial net gains appeared at the end of the day, but as a whole price movements were narrow and about evenly divided between gains and losses. 
--------
889-> COMMISSIONER MURPHY'S DEFIANCE
Commissioner MURPHY plainly relies on the apathy of the business men of this city and on their ignorance of the affairs that most intimately concern them. Otherwise he would not dare to insult them with the bald assertion that the injury suffered by business interests is due to "the statements of the press." 
--------
890-> UNIVERSAL REJOICING OVER PRESIDENT'S PROGRESS.; Belief that the Assassin's Bullets Will Not Cause Death Prevails in All Quarters.
BUFFALO, Sept. 8. -- The people of this city are singing a great song of thanks-giving to-night, and the telegraph wires are carrying the strains throughout the civilized world.

One of those who are mentioned as favoring the Panama route has declared himself openly a Panama man. 
--------
899-> The Hareskin Indians.
From The Geographical Journal. Reaching Great Bear Lake on June 23, we were disappointed to find that the ice of the lake was still as continuous as in mid-winter. This was anything but an encouraging outlook to greet our arrival, and it was made the worse by the news which the Indians brought in a few days afterward. 
--------
900-> MR. JEROME NAMES HIS OfFICIAL STAFF; Several of Mr. Philbin's Assistants Remain in Office. Osborne, Schurman and Garvan to Aid the New District Attorney -- Mr. Jerome's Pledges and Plans for a Detective Bureau.

--------
901-> CRITICISM OF FIREMEN.
To the Editor of The New York Times: Your correspondent's article on the burning of the Zeta Psi Fraternity house makes more evident. than ever the necessity for the overthrow of Tammany Hall and all that it means; and as my room was very close to that fire I ask to be permitted to add a word to the fast-growing evidence against the character of our present City Government. 
--------
902-> JUMPED OUT WINDOW AND SHOT BURGLAR; Hayes Was Awakened by Robbers and Prompt to Act.

--------
903-> WHAT IS DOING IN SOCIETY.
The arrival and departure of transatlantic ships are the principal features of Wednesday. Town is filling up slowly, but as yet many of the fashionable residences are still closed.

--------
906-> A CORNER IN RAILROADS; A True Story of Reconstruction
IN THE year 1870 the State of Mississippi was in the throes of reconstruction. She hud just emerged from the period of military government and had organized a civil one, with James L. Alcorn as Governor, and had a Legislature, of which about one-half were negroes and the other half carpet-baggers, adventurers, who had come into the Stale for the special purpose of holding office, and had no further interest in the common-wealth. 
--------
907-> The Water Buffalo.
From The Spectator. As a beast of draught, the buffalo has astonishing powers of hauling heavy traffic over bad roads. It can plow in mud over its hocks. It is most docile. It can swim a river going to and from work, tow barges along canals and streams, sometimes walking in the shallow water by the banks, like the horses did on the Lower Thames before the towpath was made. 
--------
908-> GERMAN PRESS BITTER.; Say that the Anti-British Movement Is Entirely Spontaneous.
BERLIN, Nov. 23. -- The press discussions of Anglo-German relations have been multiplied through the publication of a letter from Mr. Chamberlain's secretary, the North German Gazette's declaration regarding this incident, and the English press expressions on the subject. The letter is pronounced here to be quite unsatisfactory. 
--------
909-> VICTIMS of the CLIPPING BUREAU HABIT
ANOTHER new "clipping bureau" started up in business in New York last week. At the present time there are nearly a dozen of these concerns in the metropolis, and all, apparently, doing what is called out West "a land-office business." The business is largely based upon the vanity of "prominent citizens" or of their wives. 
--------
910-> THE GOVERNMENT'S FINANCES.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 3 -- The monthly statements of the public debt to-day shows that at the close of business Aug. 31, 1901, the debt, less cash in the Treasury, amounted to $1,036,349,866, a decrease for the month of $5,460,597. The debt is recapitulated as follows: 
--------
911-> OUTSIDE SECURITIES.
Business in the outside market yesterday was somewhat more active than on Thursday, and the downward movement of prices which had been in progress for two or three days was arrested by advances in some parts of the list. Some further declines were recorded, but here and there in the market, especially in the copper stocks, a stronger tone appeared. 
--------
912-> Seaman -- Aldridge.
FISHKILL LANDING, N.Y., Oct. 22 -- At 5 o'clock this afternoon, at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, Charles H. Seaman and Miss Grace Aldridge, both of Fishkill Landing, were united in marriage by the Rev. Joseph P. Cameron. The maid of honor was Hiss Mary G. Seaman, the bridegroom's sister.

The picnic was held on the beach and in the woods adjacent thereto. 
--------
915-> WHAT IS DOING IN SOCIETY.
Again the news from Buffalo on Friday was of such a nature as to make all social functions for the time impossible. There were no dances last evening at any of the resort casinos, although several had been announced, and there will be no dance this evening at Ardsley. Sunday will be spent quietly at many of the near-by seaside places and villages on the Hudson and Sound. 
--------
916-> "HONOR" IN THE GERMAN ARMY; Lieutenant About to be Married Murdered in a Duel.
Copyright, 1901. LONDON, Nov. 9 -- The cruel absurdities of what is called discipline and honor in the German Army were never more revoltingly shown than in the positive murder of poor young Kurt Blaskowitz a Lieutenant of artillery who was killed in a duel this week. 
--------
917-> MICHAEL DAVITT IN CHICAGO.; Reproaches United Irish Societies for Not Helping Motherland More.
CHICAGO, Aug. 15. -- "We are going to keep up the fight for National liberty at home as long as a Celt remains who refuses to live contentedly under the British flag, whether you help us or continue to help England by encouraging more of our people to desert our colors." 
--------

WASHINGTON, Oct. 15. -- Two enlisted men of the navy are about to cross the line between forecastle and quarterdeck, without having been qualified to be line officers at the Naval Academy.

--------
919-> REMOVAL OF MR. DOGGRELL.; Civil Service Board's Inquiry Into Allegation that He Was Discharged for Political Reasons.
Commissioner George Kraft of the State Civil Service Board yesterday made an investigation into the complaints against George E.

CHICAGO, Aug. 23. -- Forty and fifty cents discount was charged to-day for New York exchange. Interest rates for time and call loans, 4 1/2 to 5 per cent.

--------
922-> HUGH M'LAUGHLIN'S VIEWS; Messrs. Hill and Coler Not Shelved, He Emphatically Declares. Controller, He Says, Will Answer the People's Call -- Refers to Mr. Ridder and the German Vote.
Hugh McLaughlin, the Democratic leader of Kings County, discussed politics at Jamesport yesterday for a Brooklyn Times reporter. The most important statements in the interview are that Controller Coler has not been put on the political shelf and that Mr. McLaughlin still believes that David B. Hill is one of the ablest statesmen in the United States. 
--------
923-> VICTIMS OF THE TUNNEL NUISANCE.
To the Editor of The New York Times: Permit me to say a few words regarding the Fourth Avenue tunnel nuisance. There are exactly 3,729 houses affected by it, inhabited by 93,386 human beings. Some of these get noise, smoke, gas, and vibration; some noise and vibration, to say nothing about the loss in rental values and necessarily taxable values. 
--------
924-> FUSIONIST FORCES AT ODDS IN BROOKLYN; Quarrel Over the Nomination of a Borough President.
A break occurred last night between Lieut. Gov. Timothy L. Woodruff, representing the Kings County Republican organization, and the leaders of the Citizens' Union in Brooklyn.

--------
925-> MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION APPEALS TO THE MAYOR; Requests that He Place Mr. Devery on Trial.
The Merchants' Association yesterday sent a letter to Mayor Van Wyck requesting him to insist that its charges against Deputy Commissioner Devery should be pressed. Commissioner Murphy had refused to take any official cognizance of the changes beyond replying to the association that they were not of sufficient importance to require a hearing or a trial. 
--------
926-> Fort Orange and Some Other Interesting Places.
To The New York Times Saturday Review: While in Albany recently I attempted to locate the site of old Fort Orange, and during my investigations accosted three or four intelligent looking men who answered me in a gentlemanly manner, and, although they had resided in Albany from forty to seventy-five years, none of them could tell me where to look for the site of the old log fort called Fort Nassau or Fort Orange. 
--------
927-> BOERS KILLING NATIVES.; Mr. Brodrick Says They Slay Kafirs to Hide Their Tracks -- Thinks Burghers in the Field Number 10,000.

From The Cleveland Leader. The flow of mirth and jollity at the opening ceremonies at the new Ninth Precinct Police Station Wednesday evening was interrupted by a dirty face being pressed against the window of the room where the eatables and good things were displayed. 
--------
930-> HEAVY DEALS ON THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.; Movement in Grain Recalls the Great Transactions of Former Years.
CHICAGO, Dec. 4. -- Speculation on the Board of trade to-day was such as to recall the great transactions of Hutchinson, Cudahy, Kent, Ream, and the other giants who ruled the pits and swung prices for fortunes every session. Bull enthusiasm such as has not been seen often in late years had possession of the markets, and in spite of heavy selling for profits every pit closed strong. 
--------
931-> Children's Book-Plates.
Mr. Stone's book is limited to 350 numbered copies and is printed on a good quality of handmade paper, in well-selected type, being rubricated throughout. The running titles are set in a well-designed font of small capitals, separated from the body of the page by two red lines, one much heavier than the other, which renders the page unusually effective. 
--------
932-> IN THE FOOTBALL WORLD; Quaker Team Arrives for the Columbia Game To-day. BETTING FAVORS THE FORMER Yale Will Play West Point and Princeton Expects to Beat Cornell -- Line-Up of the Various Teams.
Football will be thoroughly alive to-day in every part of the country where collegiate interest and athletic rivalry are to be found. It will be a day of many big gaines, and they are all bound to be interesting because the well-known teams have been whipped nicely into shape during the contests of the last three or four weeks. 
--------
933-> Billiard Champions to Meet.
CHICAGO, Aug. 31. -- George Sutton, the Canadian billiard expert, has accepted the challenge of George Slosson of New York to play a match at eighteen-inch balk-line, "no shot in," for the championship, of America. Sutton, in his acceptance, which was wired to New York to-night, agrees to play for $1,000 a side, and asks that the match be played in New York early in November. 
--------
934-> THE TUNNEL IMPROVEMENT PLAN.
The plans submitted by the Engineers' Department of the New York Central Railroad to President SEXTON of the Board of Health, for approval, show very clearly a settled purpose on the part of the management of that corporation to continue the nuisance while making a pretense of measures for minimizing the discomfort and danger resulting therefrom to passengers by the tunnel route. 
--------
935-> REVISION OF THE TARIFF.; Ex-Speaker Henderson a Stronger Protectionist than Ever Since His Visit to Europe.
MANCHESTER, Iowa, Oct. 10 -- D.B. Henderson, Speaker of the House of Represetatives in the last Congress, made one of the principal addresses at a Republican meeting here to-night. He said in part: 
--------
936-> LINER'S PASSENGERS DELAYED FOR HOURS; Only Twenty-two Customs Inspectors to Meet the Campania. System Denounced as an Outrage and the Officials as Incompetent -- What an Inspector Says.
Not since the new customs regulations went into effect was such trouble encountered in the examination of passengers' baggage as was met with on the docks of the Cunard Line when the steamship Campania arrived yesterday morning. There were nearly 800 cabin passengers aboard, and just twenty-two inspectors to examine their baggage. 
--------
937-> Society at Home and Abroad.
THIS is the last week of the season. In fact, at many of the watering places the word "Finis" has been written and the gayeties are over for the year. To those who love the sea and the seashore, who are fond of the pathless woods and find pleasure by lakeside and mountain summit, the country was never more beautiful, never more attractive. 
--------
938-> In the House of Lords. 1844.
Earl Nelson in The Monthly Review. I remember seeing Archbishop Howley and some of the other Bishops in their wigs. On one occasion I saw Lord Holland come down, to support the Government, on crutches and with his gouty foot tied up with linen, just like the old caricatures; and I have seen the late Duke of Argyle's father sitting in the House in his kilt. 
--------
939-> TROUBLE AT THE VICTORIA.; A Remarkable Production at Mr. Ham- merstein's Theatre in Seventh Avenue.
More in sorrow than in anger it must be recorded that last night the Russell Brothers appeared in "Sweet Marie" at Mr. Hammerstein's Victoria Theatre. Just why the Russell Brothers should be especially mentioned in connection with this production it is difficult even to surmise, but perhaps it was because they are the most extraordinarily wearisome persons who ever came to depopulate a local auditorium. 
--------
940-> THE REV. DR. TALMAGE SCORES THE ASSASSIN; Scoundrel's Brains Should Have Been Dashed Out at Once. Mr. MeKinley "The Most Consecrated Christian Man Who Ever Sat in the President's Chatr."

SOUTHAMPTON, L.I., Aug. 10 -- The pony races held this afternoon by the Southampton Horse Association on the Great Plains Road in front of Henry G. Trever's residence produced excellent sport. All of the fashionable cottagers came to witness the races and formed a stand with their four-in-hands, drags, breaks, and automobiles. 
--------
942-> Article 12 -- No Title
Mr. Townsend and the New York Police. In view of the and recent disclosures that have been made of the connivance at crime by the New York police it is perhaps worth while noting that one of the prominent characters in Edward W. Townsend's new novel, recently published by Harper  Brothers, is Neill Mulgrave, a typical New York politician and "boss" of the Swamp district. 
--------
943-> GENERAL NOTES.
Capt. J. B. Prescott is about to retire from the Boston Fire Department after forty-seven years' serivce in It. He will receive a pension. 
--------
944-> BOOK COLLECTING.; Beginners in the Pursuit and the Things They Must Know and Do.
SUCCESSFUL book collectors are by no means always those whose libraries contain the greatest number of examples of early printing and artistic book-making, or the longest rows of first editions and autograph copies. A man may have spent a fortune for his books and never really made a lucky find in some dusty little shop. 
--------
945-> MISS GOULD'S NEW GIFT.; New York University Receives from Her a Perpetual Endowment Fund of $12,000 for Scholarships.
New York University has received from Miss Helen Milier Gould the gift of a fund for the perpetual endowment of two prize scholarships, one for young men graduating from the High School at Irvington-on-the-Hudson and the other for those graduating from the High School at Tarrytown-on-the-Hudson. The fund amounts to $12,000. 
--------
946-> AMERICAN ANTHOLOGIES.
The reappearance, in a neat and portrable form of "The Golden Treasury of American Songs and Lyrics," edited by Mr. Frederic Lawrence, Knowles, brings to mind the need of a really representative, anthology of this size and portability. We mean no unnecessary reflection on this editor in saying that this volume by no means meets that requirement. 
--------
947-> A Bibliography of Kipling.*
Mr. Luther S. Livingston, the well-known New York bibliographer, has lately issued "Works of Rudyard Kipling," a description of a fine sot of the first editions of his books in the library of a prominent New York collector. This volume is beautifully made, its typography and mechanical arrangements being the work of the Gilliss Press. 
--------
948-> "Love in a Mist."*
The graceful title of Post Wheeler's new volume of poems embodies the poetic name of a flower. This the author applies to a theme of love, around which the other poems cluster. In the central group there is a suggestion of a story of passionate love ended by death, and in the sequence of these songs one of the best is the following: 
--------
949-> LONDON LETTER.
LONDON, Sept. 18 -- The publishers of a certain new novel have hit upon a new idea in the way of advertising. They have printed upon the blue paper wrapper of the book a collection of extracts which are expected to catch the eye of the loiterer near a book stall, and to induce him to buy the book. 
--------
950-> BISHOP POTTER ON TAMMANY.
It was the late THOMAS CARLYLE who observed of Bishops' charges in general that mankind no longer reads them, "preferring speech which is articulate." The gibe was fair enough, as Carlylean gibes go. But we seem to recall having said upon a previous occasion that it fell harmless and inapplicable to the charges of the Protestant Episcopal Bishop of this diocese. 
--------
951-> MORE ALLIES FOR EDWARD M. SHEPARD; Brooklyn Democratic Club Will Support His Candidacy. The Vote of the Organization, 49 to 24 -- A Spirited Debate at the Meeting.
The Brooklyn Democratic Club, an organization made up of independent Democrats, indorsed the candidacy of Edward M. Shepard at a meeting held at the club rooms, 201 Montague Street, last night by a vote of 49 to 24. 
--------
952-> GREAT NORTHERN RAILROAD CONTROL; Hill-Morgan Plan to Organize a Proprietary Company. Will Release a Large Amount of Mr. Hill's Capital -- F.D. Underwood to be the Road's President.
Flans have been formulated by James J. Hill and J.P. Morgan  Co., under which a rearrangement of the control of the Great Northern Railroad Company will be effected for the purpose of making it easier for Mr. Hill to retath the control of that road. 
--------
953-> GEORGE MOORE.; A Recent Visit to His Home in London and a Talk with Him.
UNFORTUNATE enough was I to see Mr. Moore at his house in Victoria Street, London, before his partiotic flight to Ireland, where he hopes to be instrumental in reviving the supposedly defunct Irish language. 
--------
954-> JAMES WILCOX IS IN DANGER OF LYNCHING.; Armed Guard All That Prevents Attack on Man Suspected of Miss Cropsey's Murder in North Carolina.
ELIZABETH CITY, N.C., Dec. 28. -- Hundreds of men listened to the reading of the verdict of the Coroner's jury upon the death of Miss Ella M. Cropsey, whose body was found in the Pasquotank River yesterday. The verdict was read to-day in front of the Coroner's office, the publication of the jury's deliberations having been withheld because of the feeling against James Wilcox, the girl's sweetheart, who is still confined in the county jail. 
--------
955-> ART AND HANDICRAFT.
The task of the appraisers of the Custom House in drawing nice distinctions between the work of the artist and that of the artisan, and deciding for purposes of valuation what is art and what is not, often leads to results reminding one of the dictum of the English railway guard in enforcing the company's rules: " Cats is dogs and must go to the luggage van; turtles is insects and may stay." 
--------
956-> SALAD HINTS
A GOOD sized bowl is the first essential of salad making. With this well cooled the salad leaves fresh, crisp, and dry, without blemish and perfectly clean, the mixing presents but little difficulty. Very little oil is required for a plain salad. The oil should be poured first upon the salad leaves, and these lightly tossed until they are coated with oil. 
--------
957-> PHYSICIANS DECLARE THAT CZOLGOSZ IS SANE; Examine Him in Jail and Find No Mental Derangement.
BUFFALO, Sept. 9 -- While Czolgosz committed his crime here and will be prosecuted and punished here, the operations of the Secret Service officers who are attempting to ferret out an Anarchist conspiracy of which his attempt to assassinate the President was the climax, are in the main being conducted away from this city. 
--------
958-> PENNSYLVANIA ISSUES SHAPED BY DEMOCRATS; Republican Corruption Denounced by Convention at Harrisburg. QUAY DEMOCRATS CONDEMNED National Questions Ignored -- Philadelphia Faction Fight Referred to a Committee -- An Incipient Riot.
HARRISBURG, Aug. 15. -- The Democratic State Convention to-day nominated Judge Harman Yerkes of Doylestown for Supreme Court Judge and State Representative Andrem J. Palm of Meadville for State Treasurer. The platform makes no reference to William J. Bryan or National affairs, being confined entirely to State issues. 
--------
959-> THE OHIO STATE CAMPAIGN.; Mr. Hanna to Spend Much of His Time Making Speeches.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Aug. 27. -- It is announced authoritatively that much of Senator Hanna's time during the State campaign will be spent on the stump, especial attention being given to the counties where results are doubtful. The Senator returned home to-day, much rested from a week's trip up the lakes, and will leave to-morrow for North Solon, where he will speak to the annual reunion of the Western Reserve Pioneers' Association. 
--------
960-> REGISTRATION CASES IN THE COURTS; Superintendent McCullagh's Deputies Raid an Old Junk Shop. Are Attacked by Savage Dogs, but Capture Five Men -- Columbia Students Warned by a Magistrate.

--------
1093-> SOME OUTER-OFFICE "AMENITIES."

--------
1102-> THE BRIDGE PRESENTMENT.
The tentative presentment of the officers of the East River Bridge, Commissioner SHEA, Chief Engineer MARTIN, and Assistant Engineer PROBASCO, by the Grand Jury draws a nice distinction between official negligence and a "willful" betrayal of a grave public trust, which the average citizen will find it difficult to understand. 
--------
1103-> Former Travel in Italy.
From The Saturday Review. Posting was expensive and exciting if you traveled without a courier and were not at home in the Italian patois and coinage.

A HUGE beer truck loaded high with a pyramid of kegs slowly swung out of the car tracks. Behind the truck -- about as close behind as the law would allow -- was a trolley car, the bumper within an eighth of an inch or so of the great wheels, and the motorman gleefully turning the switch in little jerks, just enough to bring the bumpers within one-half of the narrow leeway. 
--------
1115-> Speculation.
Nothing can be more beautiful from the standpoint of pure reasoning, and nothing is more vital to the smooth working of the great machine of modern civilised life than this transfer of capital through the mechanism of the stock market.

--------
1120-> THE YEAR'S AGITATION FOR WATER.
To the Editor of The New York Times: If cleanliness is next to godliness, then the amount of water a people consume measures their civilization. Because Boston is a great civilization she has taken possession of hundreds of square miles of water area, and not only has a neverfailing quantity for herself, but enough to supply seventeen neighboring towns. 
--------
1121-> OUTSIDE SECURITIES.
Trading was at a standstill yesterday in the market for outside securities, and transactions were not numerous enough to result in more than half a dozen changes of any importance.

--------
1122-> DECLINE OF INDIVIDUAL DWELLINGS IN NEW YORK.
The Real Estate Record and Guide has compiled some interesting figures showing the marked shrinkage in the number of individual dwelling houses in New York -- or, to be more exact, in the Borough of Manhattan.

To the Editor of The New York Times: Though a faithful and constant reader of THE TIMES, the writer does not know whether an expression of dissent from its position in the present municipal campaign will be permitted in its columns.

AUGUST has arrived and with it the whirl of society. The Summer resorts are at their best, seashore, mountain. and lakeside are crowded with pleasure and health seekers, and hotelkeepers are in the acme of their glory.

There was little life to yesterday's market and practically no significance in the dealings until the last fifteen minutes, when substantial strength developed under the lead of Union Pacific, which was bought by interests identified with the property.

1157-> BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE.
To the Editor of The New York Times: That Mr. Shepard is politically blind we must concede. Heretofore we have believed in his honor.

--------

MANY a worthy citizen finds himself half awake at that hour in the morning when it is impossible to make any approximate guess at the time, judging from the quality of sunlight that creeps through his drawn curtains.

1161-> Kafirs' Strike Spreading Throughout South Africa.
LORENZO MARQUES, July 27. -- It seems likely that the trouble with the natives which originated in Cape Town and has now extended to Fort Elizabeth, will spread-throughout the whole of South Africa.

LONDON, Nov. 28. -- Although the requirements for the conclusion of the settlement are trifling, the scantiness of supplies stiffens money, in view of the month-end and in spite of the borrowings from the bank, which have relieved the pressure somewhat.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 21. -- Assistant-Secretary of State Adee was wholly unprepared to express any opinion about the dispute between Franca and Turkey, as he was absolutely without other information than that in the newspapers.

To the Editor of The New York Times: At this time, when the public is so deeply concerned as to the outcome of our esteemed President's affliction, and his deeds are being recorded on the pages of history.

There was not an incident in the patrolling of the course for the Shamrock and the Columbia yesterday that did not reflect great credit on the United States commanders of the revenue cutters guarding the great fleet and the Masters of vessels following the race.

1199-> A LIFE OF EUGENE FIELD; Slason Thompson's Biography Constructed on Peculiar Lines.*
IT can hardly be said that Eugene Field has been entirely fortunate in his biographer. Mr. Slason Thompson's volumes, while containing a great deal of entirely fresh material, much of which is of a very readable nature, are not well constructed, and, while adding materially to our knowledge of his friend, fail to leave upon the mind a well-rounded conception of Field either as man or author.

--------
1360-> THE LONDON MARKET.
LONDON, Aug. 22. -- There were superabundant supplies of money to-day and discounts were easy. Business on the Stock Exchange was stagnant. Consols were easier, owing to the lack of business. Home rails were weak. Foreigners were inactive. Argentines hardened and Rio Tintos were weak. 
--------
1361-> NOVELETTE AND PLAY.
The real history of "Beaucaire," which Richard Mansfield is to produce next Monday at the Garriek Theatre, Philadelphia, has not yet been told in full. The play is an original comedy in four acts. The impression that "Beuucaire" is a dramatization of Booth Tarkington's charming novelette "Monsieur Beaucaire" is not literally true, though Mr. Tarkington is author of both book and play. 
--------
1362-> HORSE SHOW NOW INTERESTS BAR HARBOR; Entry List Shows the Names of Many New Yorkers. Privacy in the Cottage Colony a Feature of the Maine Resort -- Dinner Dances and Fetes Champetre.
BAR HARBOR, Aug. 17. -- The season is rapidly approaching its height, and with the horse show the limit will be reached. These are very gay days at Bar Harbor, although different in many ways from other seasons. There is more privacy in the entertainments now than in other years, as the cottage element draws closer together. 
--------
1363-> THE NEWS OF NEWPORT.
NEWPORT, July 2. -- Newport to-day was sweltering from early morning till late in the afternoon. At noon in the shade on Bellevue Avenue the thermometer read 89.

1364-> HOW BOOKS SOLD.; Copies of "Trilby," "Ben-Hur," and Others That Were Printed a Few Years Ago -- Authentic Facts.
IN 1896, while working in the city department of a New York paper, the writer hereof was detailed to collect the facts and write an article on the book market, keeping in view especially the sales of the popular books of the previous year or two -- such as "Tri by" and "Ben-Hur." 
--------
1365-> RICHARDSON.; Two Notable Editions of the Works of the Founder of the English Novel.*
NOT without significance of a sort worth studying is it that we have here brought before us coincidently two wellequipped editions of Richardson's compete works. They have not come because novels are lacking and fictionists are idle, for the field of the romancer and the story-teller was never more mottled with story books that appeal to widely varying tastes. 
--------
1366-> GOV. ODELL DENIES REPORTS OF TROUBLE; Thinks Mr. Platt Will Be Leader as Long as He Lives. Says the Appointment of a Successor to Controller Knight Is Still Open.
Gov. Odell came to the city yesterday from Newburg to attend a dinner given in his honor last evening by G.K. Clark of the Produce Exchange.

--------
1368-> PHILADELPHIA PRICES.
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 22. -- The market was generally firm and showed some strength. Cambria Steel was most active in the local list, and is said to have been largely bought by Pennsylvania Railroad interests. There was much snap in the Pittsburg and Philadelphia traction stocks. Union Traction rose 1/2 and Consolidated Traction of Pittsburg and Philadelphia 1 1/4 each. 
--------
1369-> CLIMATIC INFLUENCE ON LABOR IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA
IN all the discussion that has been going on in the European papers as well as in those of the United States concerning "the American, invasion" of foreign countries with industrial products that are driving the native wares out of the market, one important point has, in the opinion of some experts here, been entirely overlooked. 
--------
1370-> GARBAGE CONTRACT CASE; Argument to Continue the Injunction Now in Force Postponed. Deputy Commissioner Gibson Answers the Charges Made by the Licensed Pilots' Association.
The application of James F. Madden, a taxpayer, to continue an injunction granted by Justice Blanchard restraining the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, the New York Sanitary Utilization Company, and Commissioner Nagle from carrying out the agreement with the Utilization Company for the disposition of the city's garbage came up for argument before Justice Gildersleeve in the Supreme Court yesterday afternoon. 
--------
1371-> SPECIALISTS IN COLLECTING.
Dr. John Taylor Brown, who died recently at an advanced age in Edinburgh, leaving behind an important but miscellaneous library, was in the habit of speaking regretfully of specialism in book collecting as seen at the present day. He had little sympathy with the modern collector who devotes attention to one or two departments or to one or two authors, forming with care and discrimination a choice and complete, though limited, collection. 
--------
1372-> RICH MAN'S STRANGE DEATH.; William E. Whiteman, a Dealer in Milk Bottles, Found Dead in His Rooms.
William E. Whiteman, fifty-four years old, a wealthy dealer in milk bottles, whose place of business was at 144 Chambers Street, was found dead in his apartments at 32 East Forty-fifth Street last night under somewhat peculiar circumstances.

She is to receive the residence 392 Madison Avenue, with the jewelry, furniture, and horses and carriages for life, the property then to revert to the residuary estate. 
--------
1374-> About Handkerchiefs.
SAID the linen man: "There is no limit to the amount of money which can be spent in handkerchiefs. One nay pay ten cents for a handkerchief or $100. The latter will be a lace-trimmed handkerchief, in Duchesse or Point de Veilice, done in floral designs or scrolls.

--------
1376-> APPRAISER WAKEMAN ASKED TO RESIGN.; Receives Request from Secretary of the Treasury Gage.
Lyman S. Gage, Secretary of the Treasury, has requested the resignation of Wilbur F. Wakeman, Appraiser for the Port of New York. The request did not come as a surprise. THE NEW YORK TIMES several weeks ago exclusively announced that Mr. Wakeman was to go, and that George W. Whitehead of Niagara County, who has been serving as Collector of Customs at San Juan, Porto Rico, would be his successor. 
--------
1377-> CHIEF CROKER.; He Reiterates in Indianapolis His Expression of Opposition to Political Influence in the Department.
Chief Croker, a nephew of the noted Richard Croker, is here attending the international fire Chiefs' convention. He said last night that he thought Chief Hale was about right as to politics and fire departments. 
--------
1378-> ABOUT WALL PAPERS.
THIS is the season when every other woman's fancy seriously turns to thoughts of wall paper, interior decorations, and those things which tend to put her house in order for the part of the year when she is a little more likely to be at home than any other. May is no longer the month for moving with the well-to-do, and Fall is the time for house decorating. 
--------
1379-> A Tale of Michigan Pineries.
In a recent interview Mr. Kester has been reported as saying that his most remarkable achievement so far seems to be that he is his brother's brother, referring to Mr. Paul Kester, the dramatist of "When Knighthood Was in Flower" and "Sweet Nell of Old Drury," as well as other no less important if less celebrated plays. 
--------
1380-> BALTIMORE STOCK DEALINGS.
BALTIMORE, Nov. 29 -- The market again was dull to-day, with the net changes about evenly balanced on both sides. The larger fluctuations, however, were chiefly on the side of gains. The trading was dull and the buying reluctant, owing to the uncertainties overhanging New York. The Street listened to bull rumors on Seaboards, based on expectations of greater activity when listed on the New York Exchange. 
--------
1381-> Roumanian Customs.
From The Contemporary Review. Every Spring from the mountain villages of Roumania a throng of dancers invades the towns and cities. Their dancing is noisy, as they wear bells on their belts, sleeves, and trousers, and shout and stamp their feet on the ground as they dance: but they are unable to explain the meaning of the words they say. 
--------
1382-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD; West One Hundred and Seventh Street Apartment House Sold -- Other Dealings and Auction Sales.
B. McKeon has sold for Patrick McMorrow for about $140,000 the seven-story elevator apartment house, known as the Algonquin, 6 and 8 West One Hundred and Seventh Street, on plot 50 by 100.11. The buyer is represented by S.H. Josephs. 
--------
1383-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- "Family extravagance" is the excuse, or explanation, given by Mr. CHARLES E. FITCHAM for robbing the First National Bank of Ballston Spa of several thousand dollars. Just what he means by "family extravagance" is not explained in the dispatches, but apparently he intended merely to admit that he had lived beyond his income, and was not trying to shift the responsibility for his thefts upon his wife and children. 
--------
1384-> RESCUED FIVE AT A FIRE.; Firemen Carried a Man, Two Women, and Two Children from Burning Apartment House.
Lieut. Fred Fuchs of Engine Company No. 40 and Fireman John Fay of the same company last evening rescued a man, two women, and two children from the five-story apartment house at 372 Columbus Avenue, near Seventy-eighth Street. 
--------
1385-> THE HERMIT OF CAPE MALEA.; The Pathetic Romance of a Sailor Wrecked in Classical Seas.
From The London Spectator. There is one feature of Cape Malea that rarely fails to attract the notice of the most careless voyager doubling it by day, a touch of human tragedy and pathos belonging in point of chronology to our own time, but in universal interest to all ages. At the extreme pitch of the cape a stupendous cliff rises sheer from the fretting waves for about a hundred feet. 
--------
1386-> STATUS OF GEN. BULLER.; War Office Blamed for Circulating a Libel.
LONDON, Nov. 2. -- The exact terms in which Gen. Buller. who continues to monopolize conversation in England, advised Gen. White to surrender Ladysmith, are not yet published, nor are they likely to be published in the near future. The National Review's version of the message, while correct in substance, is incorrect textually. 
--------
1387-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- Of the many thousand people who enter and leave the city daily by the railways of which the Grand Central Station is the terminus, a considerable fraction go south from and north to that station by the Fourth Avenue surface line of electric cars. Twice each day, therefore, everybody in this fraction has a chance to observe the contrasting possibilities of tunnel travel. 
--------
1388-> RENTS IN TENEMENT HOUSES.
The Evening Post reports a meeting of persons interested in preventing tenement-house reform, who desire to procure the repeal of the present excellent tenement-house law. Like all persons in New York who find their account in the degradation of the people, they fix their hopes upon Tammany. 
--------
1389-> THE UNMUSICAL SEASON
THE week which has just ended was one of no small interest in the musical world. It opened with a concert of uncommon beauty given by the Kneisel Quartet of Boston. This concert was devoted to the honor of Beethoven's memory. a memory which is certain to be revered among lovers of chamber music for many years to come. 
--------
1390-> MR. HEWITT ON TAMMANY SHEPARD; A RETROSPECT AND A WARNING.
Two or three days before the Tammany convention met. Mr. George Foster Peabody called upon me to say that Croker was willing to take Edward M. Shepard as the Tammany nominee for Mayor and that Shepard was considering the suggestion. Peabody told me that he and Mr. Orr had advised Shepard to accept the nomination, because, whether he or President Low Should be elected, the city would be sure to have an honest administration. 
--------
1391-> Article 5 -- No Title
BOSTON. Oct. 17. -- Rain interfered with the racing programme at Old Saugus track this afternoon, and only one event was finished, that being the 2:18 trot, which was unfinished yesterday. Limerick made quick work of the race to-day. 
--------
1392-> "LET DOWN THE BARS."
Mr. JOHN W. FOSTER is a diplomatist of experience and great learning. It is not the habitual weakness of men of his class to be idealists. Whatever temptation they may have in that direction is likely to be checked by the continuous obstacles it encounters, and if it be not, its expression is generally restrained by an acute sense of incongruity. 
--------
1393-> BROOKLYN BRIDGE SAFE, DECLARES MR. PHILBIN; Reply to Alarming Reports About Experts' Conclusions. District Attorney Fears No Present Undue Strain -- To Make the Bridge Modern Would Cost, Perhaps, a Million.
"The Brooklyn Bridge is safe. At least until next August, by which time a protracted hot spell and the resulting expan- sion may have gotten in their work in the weakening of the great structure. It is as safe as it was the day it was opened to the public." 
--------
1394-> LOWELL BANK LOST $115,000.; But Gets Back $800,000 in Securities Taken by Missing Employes, Who Made a Settlement.
LOWELL, Mass., Oct. 21. -- The financial troubles which had caused great suspense to the officers of the Merchants' National Bank for three days, owing to the disappearance of its teller, Albert G. Smith, and its bookkeeper, Lewis H. Swift, practically were smoothed out to-day. The bank has lost about $115,000. 
--------
1395-> SUBSTITUTE FOR STREET SIGNS.
To the Editor of The New York Times: I might commence my present epistle with the assurance that once upon a time I have "forsworn" ever again to write or touch upon the subject of street signs, because -- well, because the matter is getting so stale it is apparently of no use, and also, Mr. Editor, because you are not, I think, as convinced of the necessity of street signs as I am. 
--------
1396-> THE LUCANIA IN A FOG.; Received and Sent Messages by Marconi System While Anchored Down the Bay.
The Cunard liner Lucania, which arrived yesterday morning from Liverpool, did not get to her pier in North River until past noon, having been compelled to anchor down the bay, owing to the dense fog. While waiting for the air to clear the Marconi operator on the liner received a message from the Umbria, which was bettned ut the company's pier, signed by Vernon H. Brown, and asking him where he was. 
--------
1397-> MR. E.M. SHEPARD'S "AT HOME"; A Feature Was that He Was Absent Most of the Time. He Declines to Say Whether He Advised Mr. Low About His Taxes -- His Other Remarks.
There was a marked falling off yesterday in the attendance at Edward M. Shepard's daily afternoon "at home" reception to political reporters. This was not taken, however, as indicating that these charming little kettle-drum-like gatherings were losing their popularity. It was quite agreed among those present that it was to be expected on a Saturday, when there is so much going on here and there, that there should be a smaller attendance. 
--------
1398-> The Author of "Nearer, My God, to Thee."
A correspondent writes: "The author, of this immortal hymn, which President Mc-Kinley quoted in his dying moments, Sarah Flower, who afterward married Mr. Brydges Adams, an eminent engineer of his day, wrote the verses in 1840, and they received a musical setting from her sister, Eliza Flower. Both were regular attendants at South Place Chape. 
--------
1399-> MAYOR ASHBRIDGE TALKS.; Says He Does Not Believe Reported Republican Defections Are True or Likely.
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 23 -- Mayor Ashbridge to-day made his first public utterance regarding the coining campaign. It was in regard to reports that a number of the ward leaders of the regular Republicans are about to transfer their influence to the independents, and he also expressed himself regarding the reports that the campaign will be one of abuse and slander on both sides. 
--------
1400-> AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS.; An English Observer Had Amusing Experiences Here, but Nevertheless Formed Favorable Opinions.
As I put my foot on the quay and landed in America, from the Celtic I was accosted by an intelligent-looking young man, who raised his hat and said, "Mr. --, I should be very glad to have your views on America." With becoming modesty I explained that I should require at least twenty-four hours residence before coming to a definitive opinion on the whole subject of his question. 
--------
1401-> GERMAN MONEY AND TRADE.
BERLIN, Sept. 29. -- The monthly settlement is passing off smoothly. The most striking feature in the make-up figures is the heavy fall in bank stocks and ocean transportation shares since August. The stock of the Dresdner Bank lost 9.75 points. Disconto-Geseilschaft 4.75, Deutsche Bank 4, Darmstadt Bank 6.25, North German Lloyd 10.75, and Hamburg-American 13.25. 
--------
1402-> THE SERVANT GIRLS' UNION.
The organization of the Chicago Working-Women's Union, which is ashamed to be known as the organization of domestic servants, offers a fruitful field for fun, whereof many funmakers have already taken advantage. In truth the propositions which are put forward as the ultimata of the union exceed in grotesque absurdity anything which has been demanded by any male union. 
--------
1403-> WHO ARE THE JAPANESE?; Their Ethnic Mixture and Future as a World-Power
THE western world has been a buyer for centuries at the sign of Japanese bric-a-brac; it has purchased Japanese porcelains, fayences, lacquers, and silks, and tried to imitate them with more or less success; but it was not prepared for the development of Japan as that development was shown in her war with China. 
--------
1404-> DR. S. WEIR MITCHELL.; The Home and Personality of the Author of "Hugn Wynne" and "Circumstance."
VERY few men have been able to live long enough to master highly more than one trade. S. Weir Mitchell may be regarded as the marked exception to prove the rule. Not so many years ago he was spoken of as a famous physician who was also an author. 
--------
1405-> Mr. Shepard Speaks Like Ulysses.
To the Editor of The New York Times: Mr. Shepard's claim that he is "no man's man" seems to have a parallel in the earliest classics -- where a similar claim was made for purposes of deception. 
--------
1406-> THE GENIUS OF IRVING.
Especial attention should be given by the readers of THE SATURDAY REVIEW to Mr. Whitelock's article on Washington Irving. Without any statistics at hand we cannot make a definite statement, but there is certainly a general impression that the works of Irving are not read now as extensively as they deserve to be. 
--------
1407-> DICKENS.; Mr. Evans Continues His Recollections of the Second Visit to This Country.
IN these papers, which strive to record the vanishing memories of nearly half a centruy freedom of souvenirs which I have already printed here and there in magazines and newspapers, some of them a score and more years ago when my remembrance of the events and persons described was naturally fresher than it can now be expected to be. 
--------
1408-> WOMEN AND BOOKS.; Mrs. Sherwood's Account of the Author of "The Visits of Elizabeth" -- Literature in English Conversation.
AIX-LES-BAINS, Aug. 12 -- I am convinced that we talk more about literature and literary people in America than they do in England or on the Continent. It is not the matter of everyday gossip among well-bred English people that it is with us. I have tried in vain to make a set of wellbred, well-taught English ladies of the best position tell me about the success of the season. 
--------
1409-> WOMEN'S WHIPS ROPE ENDS.; Aided in Beating a Man Into Insensibility, and Even Suggested Hanging Him in Revenge.
A curious tale was unfolded last night before Justice of the Peace Francios at North Bergen. It was the story of two women who wanted to hang a man. The man bared portions of his body to show the Court large welts where he had been beaten with rope ends. 
--------
1410-> The Bonaparte Library That Goes to Chicago.
The magnificent linguistic library of the late Prince Louis-Lueien Bonaparte has been acquired by the Newberry Library of Chicago, and the finest philological collection in the world is lost to England, the country of the Prince's birth. The library has been on the market for several years, and various public institutions have endeavored to secure it. 
--------
1411-> STATE AID TO LIBRARIANS.
Just at present, when the matter of library establishment is receiving general attention, owing to the constant activity of Mr. Andrew Carnegie, it would be well to bear in mind that no town or city, or even village, in this State need await the pleasure of the industrious philanthropist to acquire a good library at a small expense. 
--------
1412-> Kathrine Tynan's "That Sweet Enemy."
Katharine Tynan, author of "The Dear Irish Girl," and other Irish tales, in her new book, "That Sweet Enemy," essays to rejuvenate a very old plot with new surroundings and situations. Family feuds have always had irresistible possibilities in love stories. Mrs. Hinkson has merely added a new version to a rather generous list of them. 
--------
1413-> THE MOHAWK VALLEY.; Mr. Buell Writes of Mr. Reid's New Book, Sir William Johnson, Brant and the Iroquois."
FROM the Knickerbocker Press comes this beautifully printed and elaborately illustrated book of 455 pages. The author is a distinguished citizen of Amsterdam, N.Y. Mr. Reid frankly confesses that his subject is his hobby, and always has been.

1414-> AN ARMLESS WONDER.; John Fox of New Jersey Has No Arms, but He Can Fish, Shoot, Plow, and Saw Wood.
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Aug. 10 -- John Fox of Milltown, near this city, has reached the conclusion that a man can get along just as well without arms as with them if he will but make up his mind to do so. Fox is the mail carrier at Milltown, a position which he has held since he lost his arms in a mill accident thirty-two years ago. 
--------
1415-> BOOKS AND MEN.
Complete Works of Edmund FitzGerald. The forthcoming publication of "The Variorum and Deflnitive Edition of the Poetical and Prose Writings of Edward FitzGerald" in seven volumes as arranged by George Bentham with a preface by Edmund Gosse, is a literary event of no small importance. 
--------
1416-> "Boni Soit Qui Mal y Pense"
FROM the days when Perseus donned the "talaria," or winged anklets of Mercury, as he set out to conquer the Gorgons, and on his return delivered the beautiful Andromeda from the power of the sea monster sent out by Neptune to ravage the coasts of King Cepheus's dominions, the early history of the garter has never seen light. 
--------
1417-> The Making & and Breaking of a Boss.
The trait distinguishing Mr. Francis Churchill Williams's "J. Devlin, Boss," from all other novels dealing with the corruption of American politics is the ingenious permutation of race, religion, and party by which the author has avoided anything capable of being construed as an attack upon anything but "the machine." 
--------
1418-> CRIERS' IN THE BOOK MARKET.
Elsewhere in the present issue of THE SATURDAY REVIEW will be found a remarkable article purporting to give the confessions of one who has been supplying the literary market with many varieties of intellectual pabulum. The patent humor of this skit will not misguide the reader as to its more serious aspect. 
--------
1419-> MR. PHILBIN SAYS HE IS AFTER A HIGH OFFICIAL.; Expects an Indictment to Follow the Presentation of His Evidence -- He Will Push Police Cases.
District Attorney Philbin said yesterday morning that he intended taking steps toward the indictment of a prominent Tammany official. He said that he thought he had about enough facts to warrant the finding of an indictment, but he was not sure that he could do so before his term of office expired. 
--------
1420-> Meeting of the Ex-Libris Society.
The tenth annual meeting of the English Ex-Libris Society was recently held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, Victoria Street, London. A most interesting exhibition of book ptates of libraries, colleges, and institutions, together with literary plates, was given, over three thousand specimens being shown. 
--------
1421-> OIL AS FUEL.
The increasing use of crude oil as fuel promises, temporarily at least, to have an important influence upon the coal trade of a large part of the United States. The economy in favor of oil shown in comparative tests of oil and coal results in most instances from the fact that where such tests are made coal is relatively dear and oil relatively cheap. 
--------
1422-> GEN. WOOD RETURNS TO CUBA.; Confident that Reciprocity Will Be Granted to the Island.
Major Gen. Leonard A. Wood, Governor General of Cuba, sailed for Havana yesterday afternoon on the Ward Line steamship Yucatan. Gen. Wood came to this city Monday night from Washington, where he had spent several days conferring with President Roosevelt and Congressional leaders. 
--------
1423-> Roman Aqueducts.
From The American Journal of Archaeology. The aqueducts of the Romans may be divided into three central general groups, according to the materials of which they are constructed. This classification is the more convenient in that it conforms very nearly to their chronological arrangement. 
--------
1424-> Two American Jockeys Won.
LONDON, Sept 3.-- Sterling Balm (Maher) won Champion Breeders' Biennial Foal Stakes, (of 1,000 sovereigns, added to a sweepstakes of 10 sovereigns each for starters only, for two-year-olds.) distance, five furlongs, straight, at the Derby Summer meeting to-day.

1425-> HOW GERMANY IS TO WHIP US!
We owe to the researched of our esteemed contemporary, the Courier des Etats Unis, a most interesting account of a German military plan for the invasion and subjugation of the United States. 
--------
1426-> JUMPED FROM FERRYBOAT TO CATCH A SWIFT LINER.; Disappointed Voyager Tells Hospital Physicians He Would Have Succeeded but for Icy Water.
Michael Stoska is the name of a man from Shamokin, Penn., who tried to catch the steamship Ryndam, the Holland-America's fastest ocean liner, by swimming after her in the waters of the Hudson yesterday morning. Stoska intended sailing on the Ryndam, and was on the ferryboat Hamburg on his way to the pier when he spied the liner on her way to sea.

--------
1431-> IN THE SHOPS.
And American girls are coming to this! It is a pretty little ornament for the hair. There is a narrow bow of white velvet and a spray of green leaves with whitish berries, and no one would doubt for an instant what it is -- mistletoe. To be sure, it is only an imitation, but to think of what might happen with that sham! 
--------
1432-> Cornell Rowing Practice Suspended.
ITHACA, N.Y., Oct. 22.-- Coach Courtney has suspended all crew work at Cayuga Inlet for the remainder of the Fall. The freshmen will continue to train on the machines, but all the 'Varsity and single scull candidates will have off work.

--------
1435-> MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS; Call Rates Again Touch 10 Per Cent, but This Is Declared to be Only Natural to a December Money Market -- No Squeeze Apprehended.
Call money rates again last week touched 10 per cent., but only for so brief a time that the incident is scarcely worth mentioning unless, indeed, it be to point out that the rate was made on Friday afternoon in the last hour, loans made on that day carrying over until Monday. 
--------
1436-> Article 8 -- No Title
LONDON, Oct. 17. -- The dominating influence on the money market to-day was the condition of French exchange, the in- creasing probability of gold exports to Paris, and the prospect of the withdrawal of a considerable portion of the exceptional amount of French capital invested in London, owing to the financial situation in Paris being disquieting. 
--------
1437-> ABILITY AND INFLUENCE.
To the Editor of The New York Times: I read with interest your editorial commenting on the speech of Mr. Gage in a recent edition of THE TIMES. I would like to ask, however, if we are to understand that all the young men who do not succeed in "crowding themselves to the top" and landing $25,000 positions are incapable of filling such positions -- have not the ability to earn that amount?

From The Cornhill. Let me just jot down, with no pretense of scientific accuracy, a few of the leading genera and larger species, a few of the most noticeable instances which met even the cursory gaze.

--------
1442-> Wall and Water Gardens.
Miss Jekyll's name on the title page of a "garden book" is an indication of superiority. This beautiful volume is not quite so inviting to the general reader as the preceding "Home and Garden," with its fascinating suggestions of home-making after methods artistic, individual, and ingenious, but it contains a wealth of practical directions for using plants, frequently ignored in gardening, to produce beautiful effects.

1444-> OUTSIDE SECURITIES.
Practically no business was transacted on the curb yesterday. More thought was given to the approaching three days' holiday than to the execution of orders, and few of these found their way to the market.

--------
1446-> A CHOICE FOR VOTERS.
To the Editor of The New York Times: That the smoke of battle dims the vision or many in the present political contest goes without saying.

--------
1456-> An Abridged Poole.*
When we are reminded that the well-known index to Periodicals by Dr. Poole, although first issued no longer ago than 1882, has already reached four massive volumes, which cost $30 or $40, it is plain that an abridgement had to be made if the worK were to have any popular use. There are many libraries, even, that cannot afford to buy it, not to speak of its ever-increasing supplements.

--------
1466-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
-- There is, it seems, a "singular significance" in the fact that President McKINLEY was assassinated by an Anarchist, the singularity of the significance being due to the other fact that this form of death has hitherto been reserved for the crowned heads of Europe.

--------
1469-> "CONCENTRATION CAMPS."
The nearest prototype of the camps of concentration established by Lord KITCHENER in South Africa were those established by Gen. WEYLER in Cuba. The condition of those reconcentrados was one of the moving causes of our war with Spain, although, with the con- nivance of Gen. BLANCO, we should doubtless have gone on feeding them for an indefinite time if the Maine had not been destroyed and the war thus precipitated.

--------
1472-> TAMMANY AND RAPID TRANSIT.
To the Editor of The New York Times: Perhaps nothing more strongly reveals the desperation of Tammany in the present campaign than the impudent falsehood of its assertions in regard to rapid transit.

--------
1482-> The Inheritors." -- A Letter from Joseph Conrad.
To The New York Times Saturday Review: Referring to THE NEW YORK TIMES SATURDAY REVIEW of July 13, it is impossible not to recognize in the review of one "extravagant story" the high impartiality exercised in estimating a "work which, I fear, remains not wholly sympathetic to the critic.
