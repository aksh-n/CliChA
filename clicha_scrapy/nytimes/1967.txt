415-> 'Bullwhip Griffin'
WALT DISNEY'S latest live-action colored feature. "The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin," skipped into town yesterday at circuit showcases. How is it, for the kids? Okay, no more.The idea of plunking down a sheltered Bostonian lad and his proper butler in the San Francisco of Gold Rush days is a dandy one, the kind of thing the Disney people should have served crisp and funny. And above all, burly. There's the rub.For as a Western spoof, the picture is slow, overdrawn and tame to the point of gentility. Surely young Disney fans wouldn't have cringed at some slambang, Gold Rush vigor, plus a little "Ruggles of Red Gap" flavoring.What saves "Bullwhip"—that's Roddy McDowall, as butler who turns hero—is the frenzied climax, a slapstick bout of fisticuffs between this flyweight and a giant called Mountain Ox (Mike Mazurki). The churning confusion is poured on with all the energy and clichés of an old Mack Sennett free-for-all.The bulk of the picture has young Bryan Russell, as the spunky lad, and a blandly proper Mr. McDowall, in wide-eyed involvement with Karl Malden, as a wily (and over-acted) thief; Richard Haydn, as a displaced actor; and Suzanne Pleshette, as a proper Boston belle who also has legged it out to Old Frisco. Miss Pleshette, incidentally, is natural and disarming. Likewise Harry Guardino, as an earthy saloon owner. Cecil Kellaway, Hermione Baddeley, Liam Redmond and Joby Baker are effective briefly. And the homely face of Arthur Hunnicut peers in with wonderful authenticity as referee of that final scrap."I don't wanna see no strangleholts," he warns. Crunnnch, goes Mountain Ox, making with the knuckles.The best thing about the film, keying what it might have been, are the delightful, sprightly animated inserts threading the story and tuned up by a barbershop quartet.But "Bullwhip Griffin" is mighty tame, kids. Back to "Gunsmoke"! The CastTHE ADVENTURES OF BULLWHIP GRIFFIN, screenplay by Lowel S. Hawley, based on the novel, "By the Great Horn Spoon," by Sid Fleischman; directed by James Neilson; co-produced by Bill Anderson; presented by Walt Disney and distributed by Buena Vista.

This time it is the kind of trouble from which he can't extricate himself simply by squirting a laser-ray from his belt buckle, or tossing 10 ruffians, one by one, over a wall.This time he's nastily confronted with a really insuperable script, and no matter how hard he tussles with it, he can't toss it over a wall. As a matter of fact, it is apparent that James Coburn, playing the super-sleuth, is pretty much of the same opinion, so he really doesn't tussle too hard.He just goes along with what is clearly not only an outrageous plot, but one that makes fun of the office of the President of the United States. It seems that a conspiracy of women, master-minded by a beauty-cream tycoon, is out to take over the Government and, through control of the nuclear bomb, control the world.So this mischievous Mafia, of women arranges to kidnap the President and put in his place an actor who has been made to look exactly like him by plastic surgery. Only they haven't counted on being detected by the miraculous Flint, who is called in to fathom the mystery by his old Pentagon friend, Lee J. Cobb.That's the gist of the nonsense, and the trouble with it is that there are simply more girls and gadgets than there are jokes in Hal Fimberg's script. A female health-farm located in the Virgins Islands is the principal locale, and next door to it is a super-science-fiction rocket-launching base. Between the two, Mr. Coburn shuttles casually in his slapdash efforts to solve the mystery and prevent the destruction of the world.Under Gordon Douglas's direction, Anna Lee and Jean Hale play the most powerful females in a decidedly sluggish way, and Andrew Duggan, not that other fellow you may be thinking about, plays the President. Although the film crawls with dime-store beauties, there is a noticeable lack of sexiness in it. Women bent on being tyrants evidently haven't much time for anything else. IN LIKE FLINT; written by Hal Fimberg; directed by Gordon Douglas; produced by Saul David Productions, Inc., and released by 20th Century-Fox. At the Capitol Theater, Broadway and 51st Street, and Neighborhood theaters. Running time: 114 minutes.Flint . . . . . James CoburnCramden . . . . . Lee J. CobbLisa . . . . .
