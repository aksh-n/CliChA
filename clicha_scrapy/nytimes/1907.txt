PITTSBURG, June 6. -- Despite rumors in the iron and steel market abroad as well as in this country, a canvass of the industry warrants the statement that the last half of 1907 and the first half of 1908 will witness the largest producing capacity in the history of the United States and Canada.

Warm June winds that sent clouds of microbes flying down the Bowery yesterday also caught at discarded Sunday newspapers and hurried them along until hands none too clean caught at them. Through these newspapers sad tidings came to the Bowery. A conference of charity workers out in Minneapolis had decided to do away with tramps; railroad Presidents had sent letters indorsing the movement, and the conference favored the establishing of a National Commission of Vagrancy.

79-> THE WEAK PLACES MADE STRONG.
The amendments to the Corrupt Practices act, just approved by Gov. HUGHES, patch up some very weak spots. Judicial candidates last year contributed heavily for their own nominations. The act now provides that any person, "including a candidate," shall file for publication a statement of all such expenditures.

81-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
The latest installment of the National Civic Federation regarding municipal ownership contains one passage which is a double novelty. It is novel in that it expresses an agreement instead of a balancing of opinions, and it is further novel in the idea expressed "that public services should be reasonably regulated and afforded the protection that comes with regulation."

85-> SMALL COLLEGES.; Prof. Nash's Contention That They Are Superior Is Questioned.
There appeared in your columns a short time ago an article on the advantages of the small college by Prof. Francis Philip Nash. As an instructor in a small college, the learned gentleman undoubtedly knows the advantages of such an institution, but his argument that it is superior to the great university in democracy, scholarship, social opportunity, absence of rich idlers, etc., is specious.

Tenants for East Side Houses. Resales in Ogden Tract. Buyers for Lots at Elmhurst. THE AUCTION ROOM. MORTGAGE FILINGS FOR WEEK.
Although two or three fair-sized transactions have kept the week's reports from being wholly devoid of interest, the general tone of gossip in the offices of brokers and operators does not create expectations of any very early or very expensive revival of active trading. 
--------
87-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.; Conditions Apparently Improved. Clearing House Certificates. Figures of Bank Statement. Odd-Lot Buying an Evidence. Reducing Call Loan Rates.
Sentiment was comparatively cheerfull in brokerage offices yesterday, but as a rule brokers were careful to refrain from expressing any opinion which might inspire their customers to take on long stocks. This was done in deference to the wishes of the bankers who are in control of the relief measures, and also because of their own desire to avoid possible complications should there be a further flurry of an extraordinary, character in call money. 
--------
88-> THE FINANCIAL SITUATION.; Stock Market's Lower Tendency -- Money Market and Gold Question.

91-> MANY ORIGINS OF " COCKNEY."; And He Is Not Necessarily One Who Drops His H's.
The compound question of The London Chronicle as to the origin of the word "cockney" and the reason for its application to a Londoner can be answered rather positively.

IT IS not John Drew's inclination to be the best dressed man on the American stage: it has been forced upon him by the inefficiencies of sartorial art in America. Because a man's taste in frockcoats is an important indication of our social rights is not Mr. Drew's fault.

NORFOLK, Va., Sept. 17. -- The free-for-all race open to yachts of 40 feet length over all and under which was sailed today was not a very exciting affair, partly because the wind was light and partly because most of the men in the several crews were rather tired after the work of yesterday.

103-> THE SQUARE DEAL AT LAST.
Gov. HUGHES'S veto of the two-cent fare bill is likely to throw the assailants of the railways into the same consternation as overtook the standpatters upon Mr. TAFT'S declaration for revision of the tariff.

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., Aug. 4. -- If the promises being made here by the automobile sponsors of the champion seaside resort are realized, Atlantic City will be the automobile centre of America.

WOODFORD'S TRIBUTE Thousands Representing Military and Civil Organizations Parade Past the Reviewing Stand. Gen. Woodford's Tribute. Gov. Hughes's Speech. Sigel's Distinguished Career.

218-> MARRY AT A WEDDING.; Miss Hemphill Accepted Quickly -- Other Guests Astonished.
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., Aug. 4. -- The "matrimonial bug," which has apparently supplanted the "kissing bug" along these shores, has claimed new victims in Miss Albertha Hemphill, a prominent musician, and Albert J. Sherburne 
--------
219-> "ARTISTIC" RESEARCH.; Nikola Tesia Doubts Things Scientific May Be So Qualified.
Apart for its controversial feature, your appropriate editorial of the 8th inst., referring to Prof. Lowell, is interesting, because it raises the question whether there is such a thing as "artistic" scientific research. 
--------
220-> EXPLOSION SHAKES EAST SIDE STREET; Half a Dozen Person Cut by Class When Store Fronts Blow Out. POLICE RESERVES CALLED Gas Company Employes, Who Were Fixing the Pipes, Arrested and Allen Street Quiets Down.
An explosion of gas wrecked the fronts of 90 and 92 Allen Street, showered $3,000 worth of plate glass upon the pavement, injured half a dozen persons, and narrowly escaped killing two gas fitters yesterday afternoon, and the reserves of the Eldridge Street Station were called out to quiet the excited neighborhood.

221-> HELD AS PRIEST'S SLAYER.; Man Supposed to be John Mooradian Caught at Liverpool.
LIVERPOOL, June 17. -- An Armenian giving several names, including those of John Moovedian and Anton Leon, was formally arraigned in a police court here to-day on suspicion of being implicated in the murder of Father Gaspar Vartarian, whose body was found in a trunk in a New York lodging house on May 26. 
--------
222-> WANT NEW JUDGES FOR THE HORSE SHOW; Several of This Year's Officials Are Criticised as Incompetent. EXHIBITORS MAY DROP OUT Recent Work in the Ring Has Caused Much Criticism -- Radical Changes Are Now Demanded.
" Unless some radical changes are adopted that will improve the present system of judging and guarantee a more expert classification of the horses the Horse Show will not only lose several of the best exhibitors, but also lose the public's patronage, which is absolutely necessary for the success of the annual exhibition at Madison Square Garden." 
--------
223-> A LONG WAY ROUND.
The confession of ANTOINE THOMAS of Clermont-Ferrand in France, charged with the theft of a valuable relic from a church near Limoges, is exceedingly interesting and ingenious, but scarcely plausible. It may be that a conspiracy exists among dealers in relics to steal the antique works of art and other treasures from the churches that have now become State property and substitute for them cheap imitations, though the scheme savors of romance. 
--------
224-> "SUBJECT RACES."
One will admire the courage more than the judgment of The Hague Conference if it shall give ear to the plaints of the "subject races." Yet a "large gathering" of them is reported to have been held at The Hague on Thursday, though "under a separate canvas from the main show." 
--------
225-> HUGHES WILL NOT TAKE SECOND PLACE; But a Call to the Presidency Would Be Another Matter. VIEW OF ROOSEVELT'S PLAN Governor's Friends Believe the President Has Been Studying Senator Platt's Book.
ALBANY, July 8. -- In framing up his Taft-Hughes ticket for the next National campaign President Roosevelt evidently has reckoned without Gov. Hughes. It can be stated to-night on incontrovertible authority that under no circumstances would Mr. Hughes accept the nomination for Vice President. 
--------
226-> INFALLIBILITY.
Among the sayings of Prince BISMARCK which Herr POSCHINGER of Germany has given recently to the world are the following: "I do not consider myself infallible. I admit that I have made many mistakes." These utterances of the Iron Chancellor serve to mark the passage of time since his day of power and to emphasize the fact that the process of evolution has developed a much higher type of statesman than BISMARCK. 
--------
227-> FATE OF ALSACE-LORRAINE.
The German Kaiser is said to look with encouragement upon the scheme put forward by Herr OTTO ARENDT, a member of the Reichstag, for turning Alsace-Lorraine into a Grand Duchy and offering the territory as a gift to the second son of his Imperial Majesty, Prince EITEL FREDERICK. 
--------
228-> BRYAN ON FORTUNES.; In Lecture Here He Says He Would Not Limit an Honest One. CUSTOMS MEN DRILLED. Col. Fowler Introduces Military Exercises for Employes at Public Stores.
William Jennings Bryan arrived in town early yesterday morning, and at 11 o'clock spoke at the Hudson Theatre under the auspices of the League for Political Education. He said, among many, many other things, that under present standards it is a far greater crime to steal $100 than to steal $1,000,000. 
--------
229-> TAKES A MONKEY TO TEA.; Baroness Montardi Surprises Guests at the Carlton, London.

--------
231-> FINANCIAL MARKETS; Stocks Advance Vigorously -- Call Money Rates, 4@2 3/4 Per Cent. A SLUMP IN TIME MONEY Rates Down from One-Half of 1 to a Full 1 Per Cent -- Exchange Rates Also Fall.
The most interesting development in financial markets yesterday was not the vigorous advance in prices on the Stock Exchange, in spite of the length to which the forward movement ran here, but in the money market, where rates on time loans we horizontally reduced by the great lenders of money. 
--------
232-> BOOM IN FIREWORKS FOR THE FOURTH; Whole Town is to Celebrate with Games, Excursions, and Holiday Athletics. LOOK OUT FOR SMALL FIRES Chief Croker Tells How to Prevent Them -- Programmes of the Festivities and Sport.
Thousands of fathers -- commuters and Manhattanese -- were warned at breakfast yesterday by interested members of their families not to forget to buy certain indispensable .adjuncts of the Fourth. As a result the fireworks men downtown did a rushing business. Thousands of other fathers who were wrapped up in the turmoil of city business yesterday and who forgot the firecrackers will tie strings on their fingers and write on their cuffs this morning. 
--------
233-> TREATMENT OF AUTO STEEL.; Elaborate Care in Tempering Metal to Resist Shock and Vibration. FISHING AND FISHERMEN. Officials for Motor Club Test. Westchester Country Club Polo.
One of the most significant facts in the remarkable advance in automobile construction in recent years has been the use of high-grade steels. It is not sufficient to have a perfectly running motor to insure the endurance capabilities of a car. Every part of the frame must be stanch enough to withstand the continued shocks and vibrations to which it is subjected in long runs over ordinary roads. 
--------
234-> CLASS 8B2 POINT WINNER.; Team Captures the Meet of P.S. No. 18 at Macomb's Dam Park.
Class 8B2, with 22 points, won the meet of Public School 18, at Macomb's Dam Park. Class 7B1 was second, three points ahead of 8A1. Owing to large handicaps, Class 8B2, starting from scratch, was barely able to beat out Class 8B1, which had 15 yards, by 2 feet. J. Scott, Class 8B2, made the best individual showing, winning the sixty-yard dash and earning third place on the running high jump. 
--------
235-> VACATION SCHOOLS OPEN FOR SUMMER; 19,607 Register in Three Boroughs, with a Waiting List of 5,024. PLAYGROUNDS READY, TOO Many Useful Courses Will Be Taught -- Between 500 and 600 Begin Work at Columbia.

--------
236-> VIEWS OF READERS.; A Magazine Writer Confesses That He Is Not Getting Rich -- Varying Opinions on "The Fruit of the Tree" -- Anglo-American Union -- Prof. Lounsbury Questioned.
IN The Bookman for November there appears, under the title of "Confessions of a Magazine Writer," an article with unlimited possibilities for evil. I say this advisedly, since its apparent purpose is to inspire the literary aspirant -- who, Heaven knows! Is in need of no adventitious encouragement -- with the belief that in magazine writing he may find a pleasant and lucrative path to fame. 
--------
237-> NOTED NOVELIST'S PLEA FOR WOMEN; Stirring Appeal for the Suffrage in Elizabeth Robin's Book, "The Convert " -- A Tract in Fiction.
NEVER before has Miss Elizabeth Robins written a book into which she has evidently put so much of herself as is in "The Convert," (Macmillan.) That is not tantamount to saying, however, that it is her best novel. 
--------
238-> FIRE HORSE DANH MADE TO SEE AGAIN; The Veterinary Gave Him Up, but Engine Co. 101 Didn't -- Not Much. WORKED 2 DAYS OVER HIM Sopping Borax and Warm Water In His Eyen Till the Cinders That Blinded Him Came Out.

244-> Truth and the Pulpit.
Of several reviews of books in your valuable publication which have excited my gratitude I beg to make mention of one; and that is the article in the issue for Oct. 5, upon the "New Dictionary of the Gospels." Certain questions you ask are timely and should be laid to heart by all whom they concern. 
--------
245-> THE EUROPEAN MARKETS.; Happenings of a Day in London, Paris, and Berlin.
LONDON, Nov. 15. -- Money in the market to-day was in small supply and rates were firm. Discounts were dearer on fears that London will have to meet a further American gold demand.

--------
246-> ELLISON OUT; OTHERS FOLLOW; Mayor's Action Looked On as Move Against Murphy and the Sullivans. MARTIN JOINS HIS CAMP Bolting Tammany Leader Made City Chamberlain -- Pendleton, Bensel, and Polk Fill Other Offices.
Mayor McClellan removed Corporation Counsel Ellison from office yesterday and appointed in his place Francis K. Pendleton. The Mayor also asked for and got the resignation of Civil Service Commissioner Alfred J. Talley, and appointed Frank T. Polk in his place. He next accepted the resignation of Street Cleaning Commissioner Macdonough Craven, and appointed Dr. Walter Bensel of the Health Department to succeed him. 
--------
247-> MAGISTRATE IN A TEMPER.; House Denounces Police for Not Getting Evidence and Bounces a Clerk.
Magistrate House, in the Harlem Court, yesterday varied the monotony of the court proceedings by denouncing a Police Captain, discharging from custody the three prisoners he had arrested, and, as a climax, ordering from the courtroom the court clerk, telling him in no uncertain tones not to enter the court again while he House, was there as Magistrate. 
--------
248-> HISTORY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE; Collaborators Would Have Done Better to Have Collaborated with Anybody Except Each Other.*
ONE would rather expect a new history of English literature to be introduced by an apology. In this particular field of knowledge the surveyor, as Bacon in several fields, finds himself compelled to "note no deficience." 
--------
249-> HARVARD LEADS IN TENNIS.; May Sweep Honors in Intercollegiate Championship Matches.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 4. -- Harvard bids fair to make a clean sweep of the honors in the intercollegiate championship lawn tennis tournament now in progress on the courts of the Merion Cricket Club. Because of the inclement weather to-day, the singles went over until to-morrow, only the doubles being played, and of these Harvard won two. 
--------
250-> ELKS GIVE A BULLFIGHT.; El Paso Lodge Crosses Over to Mexico to Entertain Friends.
EL PASO, Texas, July 7. -- The El Paso Elks, who will leave Tuesday night for the annual reunion at Philadelphia, attired in bullfighters' uniforms, gave a bullfight to-night in the Mexican ring across the river for their friends.

--------
252-> SHOWS TRUST GRIP ON OIL PIPE LINES; Government Prosecutor Also Reveals a Pipe Line Under Central Park. AIDS IN EVADING RATE LAW Methods of Barring Independents Which Result in High Rates and Large Trust Profits.
Frank B. Kellogg, the Government's counsel in the suit to dissolve the Standard Company as an illegal trust, sought to prove at yesterday's hearing that the pipe line companies owned by the Standard of New Jersey are publishing arbitrary tariff rates which are not based upon the cost of transportation and tend to deceive the public. 
--------
253-> NET EARNINGS LAG AS GROSS INCRESES; Fiscal Year Statements Show New Business Has Been Done at High Cost. Factors Which May Offset, Partially at Least, Increased Wages and Lower Rates.
Returns of the earnings of the country's leading railroads for the full fiscal year, which are now coming to hand, serve to emphasize the inroads upon the net earnings of the railways that have resulted from the heavy increases during recent months in the cost of operation due to higher wages and increased cost of materials. 
--------
254-> OVOID BILLIARDS.
" English billiards" is among the most insular and insulated of games. "Playing marbles on a five-acre lot" it has been scornfully defined by devotees of the type elsewhere favored and familiar. The British billiard table is so monumental an object that it is not surprising it should not be exported, except, like British beer and British pickles, to the colonies. 
--------
255-> 11 YEARS IGNORANT OF LOSS OF FORTUNE; Aged Pennsylvania Mountaineer Finds His Bank but a Memory. THE BLOW MAY KILL HIM Check for $50 on Defunct Bank, to Carry Him Through the Winter, Found in Pocket.

--------
257-> STEEL TRUST'S RECORD EARININGS; Last Quarter's Profits Exceed by Four Millions Those of Any Previous Quarter NEW ORDERS FALL OFF Contraction of 25 Per Cent. In July Compared with Last Year -- Heavy Improvement Charges.
In the face of an admitted recession in the volume of the new orders coming to hand and following closely upon numerous predictions of a falling off in general business, the United States Steel Corporation last Tuesday reported earnings for the second quarter of the year exceeding by nearly $4,000,000 the largest earnings reported for any previous quarter. 
--------
258-> JOHNSON WINS AGAIN.; Elected Mayor of Cleveland Over Burton by Good Majority.
CLEVELAND, Nov. 5. -- Chairman Baker of the Republican Committee late to-night conceded Tom L. Johnson's election by more than 5,000 plurality. Mayor Johnson believes his plurality will run to 8,000, but he is satisfied if he wins by 5,000 as it is a victory for 3-cent fare against the hardest fight ever waged in any municipality. 
--------
259-> PLAN TO SHORTEN THE SCHOOL COURSE; Brooklyn Teachers' Association Hopes to Get National Support for Its Scheme. NEW PROMOTION SYSTEM Point Basis Strongly Advocated -- Fifteen Years, Instead of Sixteen, for Liberal Education.
An investigation conducted by a committee of the Brooklyn Teachers Association, a report of which has just been published, shows that educators throughout the United States favor a system promotion by subjects instead of by grades in the secondary schools, and believe that a liberal education course should be devised to take fifteen years in its completion instead of sixteen years, as at present. 
--------
260-> Cubs Profit by Pirates Misplays.
PITTSBURG, Sept. 7. -- The Chicagos made their last appearance in Pittsburg to-day, and won on misplays by the battery and errors in the field. Pittsburg hit Reulbach hard in the fourth inning, compelling him to vacate in favor of Fraser. Pittsburg made all its runs in that inning, but fell one short of tieing the score. The score: 
--------
261-> THE CONVENTION CITIES.
Chicago, of course, wants both the National political conventions next Summer. That huge town has a large enough convention hall, and all the hotels necessary. There would be no question there of limited transportation facilities. Chicago is fond of conventions because Chicago people like to feel themselves alive. 
--------
262-> TAMMANY WINS; M'CARREN LOSES; Foley Elected Sheriff of New York County by 27,223 Over Ihmsen. FUSION TICKET BEATEN The Republicans Have Carried Kings with the Loss of Two Candidates. CLARKE DISTRICT ATTORNEY Ran Far Ahead of His Ticket and Is Elected by 18,315. WHITMAN BEATEN HERE Gerard Wins a Supreme Court Justiceship -- Murphy Calls. Result "Most Gratifying."

--------
264-> YOUNGER PAINTERS TO THE FORE; Revealing New and Refreshing Personalities Who Disregard the Sanctity of the Wall. MISS JONES'S "THE PORCH" The Current Exhibition of the Fellowship of the Pennsylvania Academy Proves Refreshingly Interesting.
The annual exhibition of work done by the members of the Fellowship of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts is an excellent demonstration of the none too generally accepted dictum that to sketch is to paint. This truth has been vaguely borne in upon many who have had the opportunity of seeing the sketches and the so-caled "finished" work of painters. 
--------
265-> THE AMERICAN TRAMP AND WHAT HE COSTS; Twenty-five Millions of Dollars the Estimate of the Damage Done Annually to the Great Railway Systems -- Interesting Facts and Figures.
AT a conference of representatives of a large number of railroads which recently was held in Minneapolis there was presented from each road a set of figures approximating the amount of damage sustained by the road through the depredations of tramps. 
--------
266-> JAPANESE ARE FRIENDLY.; Agitation Against the United States Fails -- Stock Slump Stopped.
TOKIO, June 17. -- The attempt of the Progressives to make party capital out of the San Francisco affair has proved fruitless. It failed to produce excitement or to obtain the assistance of any other party. The national sense is plainly opposed to dragging international questions into the arena of party politics. 
--------
267-> GERMANY'S ISOLATION.; Empire Left Out of All the Agreements Recently Concluded.
LONDON, June 17. -- The Anglo-Franco-Spanish agreement apparently leaked out at an inopportune time. The contracting parties would have preferred to keep the matter secret until after the adjournment of the Peace Conference at The Hague. King Edward's visit to Cartagena is believed to have laid the foundation for the new triple understanding, which, the Governments interested say, does not amount to an alliance. 
--------
268-> RAGGED BASEBALL BY THE YANKEES; New York Make Eleven Errors and Detroits Get Fifteen Hits. RECALLS OLD-TIME METHODS When the Game Was Brought Into Disrepute -- Manager Griffiths Landed on a Spectator.
Detroit won another game at American League Park yesterday afternoon from New York by a one-sided score.

--------
269-> PEACE DELEGATES FEELING GLOOMY; Sorry That Mr. Roosevelt Yielded the Initiative to the Czar. NO ARMAMENT DISCUSSION Last Chance of One Apparently Gone -- Our Desire for a Drago Doctrine Committee Not Gratified.
THE HAGUE, June 17. -- Although the "Pacifists" still insist that the question of the limitation of armaments must be raised in some form before the adjournment of the Peace Conference, the last chance of any Government coming forward openly to propose the discussion disappeared with the knowledge that the Government of the United States considered that the initiative belonged to Europe, and not to America. 
--------
270-> NEW WEATHER THEORY.; Is Wireless Telegraphy Changing Our Climate?
It would be well if those having sufficient authority should undertake the task of finding out what is causing the present rainy season. 
--------
271-> ITALY PARDONED FERRARA.; But He Insisted on Resigning His Post at the Peace Conference.
THE HAGUE, June 26. -- In an interview to-day Col. Orestes Ferrara, ex-Secretary of the Cuban delegation to the Peace Conference, confirmed the report that he had tendered his resignation to Gov. Magoon. The latter, in reply, said he regretted the action of Col. Ferrara, who thus deprived the Cuban delegation of his services, adding that he acceded to his request only at his insistent demand.

More Stores for Lexington Avenue. Lower Second Avenue Deal. Buyer for Prince Street Property. To Build on Histortic Site. Bronx Corner Changes Hands. Prospect Avenue Flat Sold. Leases to Country Estates. THE AUCTION ROOM. MORTGAGE FILINGS FOR WEEK,
What with a holiday interruption and the apparent tendency of the market to lapse gradually into Summer conditions the week's reports have contained little that was important or even moderately interesting. 
--------
273-> MR. ROOSEVELT'S PICTURES.; An Occasion When He Took Seven Costumes to the Photographer's.
Don't you think you are a little severe upon our dear President -- wishing him to stop sending his photographs broadcast? If he should cease to be amusing his occupation would be gone. 
--------
274-> OVERRULES STANDARD OIL.; Circuit Court Disallows Exceptions to Trust Complaint.
ST. PAUL, June 7. -- The United States Circuit Court to-day overruled the exceptions to the complaint of the Government against the Standard Oil Company. The defendants were granted leave to answer portions of the bill to which exceptions were filed.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 4. -- Secretary Straus of the Department of Commerce and Labor and Frank P. Sargent, Commissioner General of Immigration, have determined to eliminate the "white slave" traffic if possible. 
--------
276-> Cincinnati's Errors Are Costly.
CHICAGO, July 2. -- Cincinnati's two errors and both of Coakley's passes were followed by hits, which gave the locals to-day's game. Lundgren was replaced by Overall after he had given nine bases on balls. The visitors made a great bid in the ninth, Lobert leading off with a double and Mitchell following with a triple, but the next three were easy outs. The score: 
--------
277-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD
Aside from those brokers and operators are always hopeful of finding an investment buyer for a tenement-or an apartment house of moderate value, the general market seems to have accepted with resignation the idea that the next six weeks or two months will be productive of little new business. 
--------
278-> BIG TEA AT BELMAR.; The Young People Enjoy Crabbing on the Shark River.
BELMAR, N.J., July 13. -- Mrs. L.S. Gerhart gave a tea to forty guests Thursday. This was held in the Grove. This is a semi-outdoor cafe, new this year, where flowers and vines and cool breezes are always to be found.

--------
280-> THREE STATIONS NEEDED.; Relieve Brooklyn Bridge Crush by Dividing the Crowds.
It is apparent to every one that wherever there is concentration there congestion is inevitable. It is feasible to separate the three stations at the bridge entrance. Make the station of the Third Avenue "L" at Chambers Street and extend the bridge to Chambers Street. 
--------
281-> Article 1 -- No Title
MOST phenomenal is the growth and development of the American hat, but it is not confined to the United States alone. You will find these hats in all the great capitals of Europe, covering the finest heads in the world. 
--------
282-> TO DISFRANCHISE NEGROES.; Georgia Lower House Passes the Bill -- It Goes to Governor.
ATLANTA, Ga., Aug. 14. -- By a vote of 159 to 16 the lower house of the Georgia General Assembly to-day passed the bill aimed to disfranchise the Negroes.

The facts regarding the affairs of the Lake Superior Company which were made public in THE TIMES yesterday increased Wall Street's interest in the terms of the agreement between the Lake Superior Company and the ore land trustees, by which the former turned over a long list of iron mining company stocks to the four trustees who hold them for the benefit of the Great Northern stockholders. 
--------
284-> FOOTBALL RULES COMMITTEE PLAN; Intercollegiate Association Makes Provision to Meet Big Colleges' Views. TO HAVE 3 YEARS' TERM Changes Effected In Association By- Laws to Make Regulation of Athletics More Binding.

--------
285-> AGAINST FEDERAL CONTROL.; Meeting of State Railroad Commissioners Adopts Resolution of Protest.

BOSTON, Oct. 4. -- It is little short of scandalous that John Harvard's biography should be written by an Englishman and not by some Charlestown man, inasmuch as Harvard lived and died in Charlestown, where his name has been commemorated by a church, two schools, a square, a street, and a "place," and where his monument was set up by the graduates of the University in 1828 in the cemetery containing his unknown grave.

If a mere nature faker had been in the Bronx Zoological Gardens yesterday morning instead of a solemn keeper of unimpeachable veracity he would have gained enough facts about the humanity of buffalo to fill several books for the public schools.

" Warmed-over dishes are not always as palatable as George Broadhurst's old farce, now served under the title of "The Lady from Lane's," with a liberal garnishment of girls and millinery and a sufficiently piquant sauce by Gustave Kerker. Enough remains of the farce to provide a slight but intelligent story, which the interruptions, pleasant enough in themselves, do not entirely nullify.

491-> MR. JACKSON'S ELECTION.
Whatever may be his other defects, Attorney General JACKSON is not timid. If called upon to define by a positive term the quality that has prompted him officially to advise the issue of a call for a special election of Senators this Fall, we should say that it is audacity or hardihood rather than courage. 
--------
492-> "THE FOLLIES OF 1907."; Big Vaudeville Show, with Anna Held Chorus, Tried at Atlantic City.
ATLANTIC CITY, July 3. -- " The Follies of 1907" was produced at the Savoy Theatre to-night.

497-> NATURE LOVERS VS. DESTROYERS; Even If Dr. Long Be Inaccurate He Arouses Sympathy with Wild Life.
In the discussions of the Roosevelt-Long controversy that have taken place, the real question, it seems to me, has been missed.

--------
500-> THE GOVERNOR'S POWERS.
We have received from Mr. WILLIAM H. HIRSCH a courteous, but somewhat elaborate, criticism of our opinion that the objection to the Governor's jurisdiction in the Ahearn case was "flimsy."

When Patrick T. Powers manager of the annual six-day bicycle race held in New York, went abroad last Summer to secure the fastest riders in the world for the forthcoming race, he neglected to sign Arthur Vanderstuyft, the Belgian, not because he looked speed, endurance, or pluck, but because he was looking for new champions.

One very often sees in the journals devoted to women a list of rules by which the uninitiated members of the weaker sex may win the affections of the stronger.

608-> THE "ROOSEVELT SLUMP."
There is no public evidence that the President regards the serious fall of security values in Wall Street as a calamity, or even as a warning. Political advantage may emerge from business disaster. But for the money panic of 1893 Mr. BRYAN would have made no headway in 1896.

Your article in last Sunday's issue entitled "Won't Drop Politics, Is Asked to Resign," and subsequent interview with Shipping Commissioner Knight, in which he says that such men as he elected President Roosevelt, and that Civil Service is a fraud, is only a beginning of an agitation that is spreading through our country against that monstrosity that is so carefully nurtured by President Roosevelt and fostered and extended by his subordinates -- the Civil Service.

TANNERSVILLE, N.Y., June 30. -- The message of Dr. Harry Friedenwald, President of the Federation of American Zionists, which he read at the opening session of the convention here to-day, was in part a reply to recent remarks of President Kaufman Kohler of the Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati, and to charges that the Zionists were untrue to Jewish ideals and disloyal to the principles of American citizenship. 
--------
615-> THE NEW YORK WAY.
The people of New York are to be congratulated that their problems regarding public utilities are being settled in the New York way, the way of the square deal, which was settled New York practice before that phrase became popular.

620-> THE LUSITANIA.
The arrival of the Lusitania at the outer bar 4 days and 20, hours after leaving Daunt's Rock on the Irish coast is a great achievement of modern ocean navigation, and nearly equals the highest expectations of the big boat's power.

LONDON, Oct. 5. -- The Indian discontent has been brought vividly within the ken of the British public this week. It was no little shock to the average Englishman to be told that the condition of Eastern Bengal under British rule was worse than that of Russia and that the atrocities committed there would, if known in England, provoke more horror than did the Turkish outrages in Armenia.

633-> MR. GOMPERS'S SLOGAN.

ASBURY PARK, July 20. -- Bathing, fads in Asbury Park have come and gone, but the latest is a sure winner. It has just arrived, but all predictions are that it will stay.

What Mrs. Elizabeth Roxbury of 515 West 122d Street hysterically described to the police of the West 125th Street Station yesterday as the kidnapping of her daughter, Agnes McMullen, 20 years old, by four men in an automobile, turned out to be an elopement, which might have ended disastrously for its hero, but for the girl's presence of mind.

Hughes as Chairman -- W.M. Ivins a Member of the Commission. Local Democrats Alarmed. Bill Drawn by Ivins. W.S. HARRIS REINSTATED. President Aids Glass Examiner Who Was Dismissed.
The fear that the Commission of Nine appointed by Gov.

PARIS, June 2. -- Business on the Bourse in the early part of the week was practically nil. A small number of securities underwent more or less marked variations in price, but these changes in quotations were due principally to the slackness of the market, which was influenced by the smallest order or demand.

1302-> GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE.
The situation in which some of the Westinghouse corporations find themselves does not involve a failure -- it seems a contradiction of terms to use the word in connection with GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE -- nor is it even a case of insolvency; it is a case of suspension under legal proceedings in order to protect the interests of all concerned.

1305-> THE MURDERS IN MOROCCO.
It is plain that the murders of foreigners in Morocco have proceeded from a racial and religious hostility on the part of the tribesmen of that country.

It s lamentable, almost discouraging, to see members of the Board of Education attempting to revive that too-recently abandoned barbarism, corporal punishment in the public schools.

While the leaders of the two great parties in this country are competing with each other in appeals for popular support for their slightly varying schemes of Government control and regulation of wealth-producing corporations, it is worth while to listen to the calm words of a publicist and student of high authority considering only one phase of the vast enterprise upon which Mr. ROOSEVELT and Mr. BRYAN are prepared to enter "with gayety of heart."

It is a good idea of the Lotos Club to provide rooms for the womenfolks of members in its new home. There are plenty of women's Clubs, and multitudes of women who cannot see the advantages of membership in them. There are more, than enough clubs for mere men.

Financially, this city received one of the severest setbacks in its history yesterday. The much-heralded bond sale, of which much had been expected, was almost a failure. The city tried to dispose of 4 per cent. securities to the value of $29,000,000, and there were takers for less than $2,500,000 worth, and even those takers offered exceedingly low prices for bonds and stocks that in past years brought high premiums.

At first glance the viewpoint of an art magazine might not see the best from which to form an opinion of the general business situation; but on second thought it will be seen that it would be difficult to find a better criterion on which to base an accurate judgment.

One, of the most striking features of the preparations of the big teams for the decisive games of the season is the attempt to strengthen the straight line plunging attack.

The wholesale egg merchants in New York were not much alarmed yesterday by the announcement from Chicago that the cold storage warehouses in that city contained 350,000,000 eggs, which were to be thrown on the market at once because the price had dropped 1 cent per dozen in carload lots the past week and forced the commission merchants to deposit more margins at the request of the banks.

THE ideal play, what is it? At first glance one is inclined to answer that there must be as many ideal plays as there are individual ideals.

The extension of the third track as a relief to Manhattan-Bronx transit congestion is, it seems to me, a delusion. A chain is no stronger than its weakest link.
