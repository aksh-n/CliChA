147-> THE SCREEN; 'Devotion,' a Fictionized Tale of Bronte Sisters, at Strand-- Horror Film at the Rialto-- 'Joe Palooka' Victoria Bill
The brilliant and baffling Brontës —the British family which prodigiously produced three remarkable literary sisters and a talented brother on the barren Yorkshire moors—have been variously analyzed by students, and the dark records of their individual lives have been sifted by solemn researchers for clues to their personalities. Obviously, hidden tensions, deep and psychologically complex, provoked the Brontës to their triumphs and tumbled them to their tragic fates. But that you would never gather from the Warners' estimation of their lives, revealed in the film, "Devotion," which opened at the Strand yesterday.The Warners have simplified matters to an almost irreducible extreme and have found an explanation for the Brontës in Louisa May Alcott terms. They have visioned sombrous Emily, the author of "Wuthering Heights," and Charlotte, the writer of "Jane Eyre," as a couple of "little women" with a gift. And the cold, irreconcilable disagreement which developed between the two girls has been politely played down by the Warners as just a sisterly tiff over a man. The man in the case is Arthur Nicholls, who was their father's curate all right but for whom there is no substantial evidence that Emily Brontë ever cared a fig.However, fidelity to record seems not to have entered at all into the considerations of the authors, Keith Winter and Theodore Reeves. And, without so much as a tremor, they have twisted the Brontë story around into a typically girlish, sentimental triangular romance. Emily is made the wistful, genuine and responsible sister; Charlotte is made the headstrong, selfish and ambitious one. Sister Anne is brought in briefly as a delicate, well-mannered girl and Brother Branwell is noisily presented as a reckless, inexplicable drunk. Papa Brontë hovers in the background as a stern but puzzled sire and Aunt Branwell, who kept house for the family, is a typical matronly sort.In the face of the major distortion, it is incidental to point out that there are many lesser inconsistencies in fact and in the customs of the times. For instance, the visit of Charlotte to London when she met Thackeray was made after the death of Emily; in the film, it is made before. And the curious affinity between Charlotte and Professor Heger, which was actually quite strained, is developed in this picture to the point of a "petting party" in a fairground's "tunnel of love."Allowing that Ida Lupino plays Emily in a meek and poignant way, that Olivia de Havilland plays Charlotte with a vast deal of pretty arrogance and that Paul Henreid plays Arthur Nicholls with the air of a faithful setter dog, this would still be a mawkish costume romance, even with identities removed. Presented as the story of the Brontës—and with the secondary characters poorly played —it is a ridiculous tax upon reason and an insult to plain intelligence.

All that remains to be said now about this latest release from Universal's bottom drawer is that it certainly doesn't justify the effort expended in its behalf.

612-> THE SCREEN; 'Monsieur Beaucaire,' Based on the Tarkington Novel and Enlisting Bob Hope, Seen as Film Travesty of High Order ...
It's a cinch that the late Booth Tarkington would not have remotely recognized his "Monsieur Beaucaire" in the picture of that title which came to the Paramount yesterday. His yarn was a ruff-and-rapier romance, and the film is—well, call it straight burlesque. But considering that Mr. Tarkington was a fellow who liked a hearty jest, he would probably have howled at the picture, just the same as everyone will.For "Monsieur Beaucaire," as now enacted by no less a clown than Bob Hope, is an item that bears a fair comparison with the best of screen travesties. Charlie Chaplin as Don José in "Carmen" or Will Rogers as "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" have only the advantage of fond memory over Mr. Hope's barber in Madrid. As a matter of fact, all things considered—including Bob's eloquent face—he might even nose out those contenders. At least, he should win by a chin.And that is because, for this picture, Melvin Frank and Norman Panama have given him a script which permits him to put his best features forward—which he unrestrainedly does. As Louis XV's timid barber who is fatefully whisked off to Spain masqueraded as a dashing court dandy and designated to marry the princess, Mr. Hope has abundant opportunities for the clowning at which he excels—and that includes attitudes and gestures as well as the broadcasting of gags.Not many scenes in opéra bouffe recall themselves more happily to our mind than the one in this film wherein the barber is led grandly before the King of Spain, duked out in princely regalia and wielding a thick-lensed lorgnette. Or the one wherein the bogus dandy crosses swords with the best blade in Spain or, indeed, the one wherein poisoned wine is served to the faker at a royal banquet.Mr. Hope is most thoroughly congenial to this sort of costumed burlesque, and he plays it with feverish vitality and an air of fatalistic despair, relieved only at those moments when a beautiful lady is marched across his path. Then, of course, he rallies, eyes gleaming and nostrils aflare, reckless (for one fleeting second) in his self-dreamed reputation as a beau.Mention of gags in any picture in which Mr. Hope appears is almost a superfluity. You know that they are there. In this case, it seems, however, that they are somewhat above the usual run. And Mr. Hope is unmercifully extravagant in throwing them away. Naturally, one gag is included to poke fun at a certain character, name of Bing, but we aren't going to spoil it by repetition. It's good. Go and hear it for yourself.As a chambermaid in the palace for whom Mr. Hope has a passionate yen, Joan Caulfield is delightfully nimble and gives reasonable justification for same. And Patric Knowles, Cecil Kellaway, Joseph Schildkraut and Reginald Owen are full of puff and blow as assorted costume-wearers in a thoroughly anachronistic court.Producer Paul Jones and George Marshall, director, did their jobs well, too. They have given Paramount—and the public—a singularly hopeful film.On the stage at the Paramount are Bob Evans, John and Rene Arnaut, Peggy Lee and Charlie Spivak and his orchestra.

804-> THE SCREEN; At Loew's Theatres
Dipping into its backlog of films made last year, MGM has finally released a frequently gay and pleasant little piece titled "A Letter for Evie," which had its New York première yesterday, opening at seven Loew's neighborhood theatres as second attraction to "The Bandit of Sherwood Forest." Although its wartime theme is now somewhat out of date, and the story is too long and often too sentimental in the telling, the film provides a number of delightful moments, chiefly through the shenanigans of Hume Cronyn, one of Hollywood's better comedians.The plot is not too original, following the familiar pattern of the correspondence between a boy and a girl who have never met. Mr. Cronyn as the boy (a soldier this time) is so aware of his unhandsomeness that he sends the girl a picture of his best buddy, representing it as himself. Of course, the buddy is handsome, and a wolf to boot. This results in the usual entanglements before the happy ending. John Carroll makes a proper heel of the wolfish buddy, while Marsha Hunt is sufficiently sweet as the girl. But the chief attraction here is Hume Cronyn, if only for his hilarious drunken scene, feigned to keep the girl away from his buddy's advances. With some stringent cutting, and a good deal less sentimentalism, this could have been a uniformly sparkling comedy.

As the Falcon, Tom Conway, baring very little in the way of talons or talent, does a strictly featherweight job of emoting. The title "The Falcon's Alibi" leaves itself open to a lot of remarks. There is no alibi for keeping this series going.

864-> THE SCREEN; 'The Raider,' a British-Made Picture Dealing With Merchantmen at War, Opens at Rialto
It is a little late now to be remarking that some of the rarest courage in the late war was displayed on the Western Ocean by the rugged and unromantic men who drove the laden cargo vessels through the U-boat-infested seas. Dramas or a high and noble order occurred in those watery wastes, and there is no doubt that many a deed of heroism lies washed beneath the lonesome waves. It is a little late now to be remarking, but it is never too late to recall the sacrifice of the sailors who transported the goods of war.And a fine and vivid reminder is a film which the British have made under the title of "Western Approaches" but retitled "The Raider" for the American screen. After a lengthy delay for technical reasons, it opened here at the Rialto yesterday. Produced for the Crown Film Unit by Ian Dalrymple, the young man who also produced "Target for Tonight," "London Can Take It" and other memorable war fact films, it is a gripping re-enactment, in documentary style, of a sequence of episodes involving the crews of Atlantic cargo ships, bound east from America to England during the darkest days of the war.The film opens with a lifeboat full of sailors torpedoed and adrift for fourteen days, patiently tapping wireless messages and beating for the Irish coast under sail. Then it picks with a convoy starting out of New York, with interesting and colorful description of the convoy techniques. En route in the Western Ocean, one of the ships, more speedy than the rest, is compelled to break convoy and take off on her own. The next day this ship receives the message—the fading message—from the lonely lifeboat and the skipper decides to make for its position. But a U-boat which has been lying near by, utilizing the lifeboat as a decoy, waits for a kill.The climax of the picture, frankly dramatized but none the less plausible or compelling, is the battle which occurs between the single cargo vessel and the U-boat—a blistering affair.Uncommon for documentary pictures, this one has been photographed in color, which renders the sight of sea and shipping, of the derelict lifeboat and the vessel's crew, all the more real and impressive, for the color is exceptionally good. And under Pat Jackson's direction, the actual merchant seamen who perform in the film give authoritative representations of their real-life and dramatic roles. Outstanding are the unidentified skippers of the rescue vessel and of the lifeboat's crew, with inspiring and moving characterizations by other men in the two groups.Full of wind and water and the solid ring of cargo ships, this film is both a tribute to brave heroes and a suspenseful story of adventure on the seas. THE RAIDER ("Western Approaches"), a production of the Crown Film Unit, London, produced in cooperation with the Royal Navy, the Royal Netherlands Navy, the Ministry of War Transport and the Allied merchant navies; directed by Pat Jackson from his own script. Released by English Films. Inc. At the Rialto.

966-> THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; 'To Each His Own,' a Paramount Picture at Radio City, Stars Olivia de Havilland in Role of Woman Who Faces Plights
When the lights came up yesterday after the first showing in the Music Hall of "To Each His Own" there was hardly a dry feminine handkerchief in the house. The ladies had a good two-hour cry and they were delighted. And unless our prognostication goes unaccountably haywire the scene will be repeated over and over for many weeks to come. It is an old and established fact that a lady can lead a man into a movie house just as easily as she can drive him to drink and Paramount, for one, obviously has not lost sight of this truism. Olivia de Havilland, who is making her second screen appearance after a prolonged absence, may now take her exalted place alongside Helen Hayes, Ruth Chatterton and Bette Davis as a tragic heroine who loved unwisely and suffered terrible consequences with heroic fortitude."To Each His Own" spins dangerously on the brink of bathos but it seldom spills over into that treacherous chasm for more than a fleeting scene or two, thanks to a screen play which artfully dodges complete morbidity. Mitchell Leisen has directed the cast skilfully and his fastidious eye for detail is evident in the carefully appointed sets which reflect the various moods and circumstances of the characters. Since the story starts in a small country town in 1918 and continues through a New Year's Eve in London, 1944, Miss de Havilland is permitted to run the customary emotional gamut, from a young girl bubbling with life to a forlorn middle-aged mother who worships her son from afar. Miss de Havilland ages gracefully and her performance is extraordinarily fine most of the time. However, she is painfully embarrassing when registering her anguished, unrequited mother love.Although Charles Brackett and Jacques Thery are not telling anything new in "To Each His Own," which follows the broad pattern of countless tales about the grief of unwed mothers, they have worked in a few refreshing twists. Or, at least, the scheme Jody Norris cooks up to conceal her shame and regain possession of her baby without the town folks being any the wiser is poignant and it is dramatized with considerable dexterity. Nor have the authors overlooked the fact that a little sunshine and humor is bound to creep into even the most tragic of lives. So it is that you will find laughter occasionally dispelling the saccharine sentiment.The early scenes in the little town of Piersen Falls are delightfully quaint. John Lund, fresh from the stage, appears in a dual role, first as the World War I flying ace, who captivates Jody on a war bond tour, and later as her grown son, whom she meets while on leave in London. Mr. Lund handles both characters nicely, though he is somewhat overshadowed by Bill Goodwin and Phillip Terry. But Roland Culver in the role of a titled British Mr. Fixit who ultimately shows Miss Norris and her son the way to happiness is superb. Mr. Culver is new to Hollywood, though he has appeared in several English films.Featured in the Music Hall's stage revue, "Metropolis," are Joe Jackson Jr., the clown; Lucile Cummings, contralto; Edward Reichert, tenor; the Glee Club and the Rockettes. The Corps de Ballet performs in "Underseas," a spectacle, with Bettina Dearborn and Charles Laskey as soloists. Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody is played by the Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Charles Previn. TO EACH HIS OWN, screen play by Charles Brackett and Jacques Thery, based on a story by Mr. Brackett; directed by Mitchell Leisen; produced by Mr. Brackett for Paramount Pictures.

989-> THE SCREEN
As a man who has braved a thousand deaths, to say nothing of those fourteen years in the dungeons of Château d'If, Edmond Dantes is not the one to sit around counting his millions. And Producers Releasing Corporation is not the company to permit him, his spouse or his kith to rusticate. So "The Wife of Monte Cristo," the cloak-and-sword period piece, which came to the Globe on Saturday, takes up—fancifully, at times—where, reportedly, Alexandre Dumas and Hollywood left off.If, in 1832, the Count's wounds still smart, it is because his old enemies are still around and he still hates injustice. And, if the Count's lady gives him more than a measure of help, it is only because she too hates injustice and, besides, is as handy with a rapier as she is with repartee. But the action, heckled as it often is by badinage, is plentiful, and those rascals who have been mulcting the plague-ridden Parisians finally do get their just deserts. As "The Avenger" for the down-trodden populace, the Count is pinked by the Prefect's police and the Countess forsakes the salon for the leadership of her husband's secret band, and after a prescribed number of clashes with the Gendarmerie and chases by moonlight, the bad men are liquidated, leaving the noble couple to ride into the sunset.Lenore Aubert is beautiful as the Countess but rather colorless as a conspiring and athletic heroine, while Martin Kosleck makes a determined but unconvincing champion of the people. John Loder plays the iniquitous Prefect with sinister grace and Charles Dingle and Fritz Kortner are properly villainous as his conniving cohorts. Although the road to Paris in "The Wife of Monte Cristo" is strangely reminiscent of the trail to Eagle Pass, the youngsters and, probably, some of their elders, will find this adventure familiar but exciting. Back to 1832THE WIFE OF MONTE CRISTO, screen play by Dorcas Cochran; from an original story by Franz Rosenwald and Edgar G. Ulmer; directed by Mr. Ulmer; produced by Leon Fromkess for Producers Releasing Corporation. At the Globe.De Villefort . . . . . John LoderHaydee . . . . .

1440-> THE SCREEN; Labored Shindig
Another of those labored little shindigs, which pass for comedy, all about an unreasonably jealous and persistently quarreling husband and wife, has been made by Universal and entitled "Lover Come Back." It arrived yesterday at Loew's Criterion, which must take the consequence. For not only is the brand of spoofing ill-humored and painfully contrived, but George Brent plays the lady-killing husband—and that's just a bit of too much. The criss-cross of unassuming chatter we could take; that's quite usual on the screen. And even a foolish little mix-up in a bedroom was bearable. But the spectacle of Vera Zorina and Lucille Ball, as Mr. Brent's wife, mooning and swooning about him is the straw to break the critic's back. Miss Ball wears a wardrobe of costumes and acts as though she really had a script. The poor lady is sadly deluded. She is completely without support. Labored ShindigLOVER COME BACK; original screen play by Michael Fessier and Ernest Pagano; directed by William A. Seiter; produced by the Messrs. Fessier and Pagano at Universal Pictures.

George ChandlerJanie . . . . . Joan FultonJoan Davis is alternating as a plain, bespectacled professor of calculus in a small Midwestern college and as an outlandish femme fatale in "She Wrote the Book." And, like the comedy which opened yesterday at the Winter Garden, Miss Davis' dual characterization is only fitfully funny. This is corn-fed humor with a capital C, yet it must be said that the old jokes still pack a mildly amusing punch, even though the comedienne doesn't get a chance to go into her familiar routine of robust antics until very near the final reel.A paragon of meekness and respectability, Professor Featherstone is prevailed upon by the dean's wife, who has written a torrid novel of international romantic adventures under the pseudonym of Lulu Winters, to pose as the amorous author and collect a fortune in royalties. All this is to be done very quietly, but the publisher has other ideas and through a fortuitous accident which blanks out Miss Featherstone's memory she imagines that she really is Lulu and—well, you can piece out the rest very easily.It is quite possible that this idea could have been turned into a delightful bit of smart nonsense if it were treated as sophisticated comedy. But Universal for reasons of its own (possibly because they had Miss Davis in mind) chose to play it for low comedy and the resultant picture is just a so-so entertainment. Jack Oakie and Mischa Auer are on hand when needed, but "She Wrote the Book" belongs to Miss Davis and her fans.
