The rigid character of our Sunday laws, and the determination which Mayor WOOD has manifested to have them strictly enforced, render it a very important question to many thousands of the denizens of our streets, and to a great multitude of strangers among us, who have no hones of their own, how they are to quench their thirst on Sunday. he

The Governor elect of the State of Virginia has sometimes been called Other Wise, but as he dates his letters from a place with the very exclusive: name of Only, it would be very well to distinguish him from other Wises by calling him Only WISE, being careful always, for the sake of avoiding misunderstanding, to use a big O.

245-> The Danger to the South.
A very spirited and picturesque Brochure has recently appeared, from the pen of Mr. C. W. ELLIOTT, upin TOUSSAINT L'OUVAATURE and his revolutionary struggle. Of the literary qualities of the book we have nothing here to say, except to protest against some most palpable, even If unconscious, Imitations of CARLYLE, which should have been abjured by an author who has so vivid a style of his own.

--------
267-> Austria's Last Move.
Our London Correspondent was perfectly right in his estimate of the new treaty's value. The marked incredulity that its trumpeted ad vantages for the allies, (those for Austria being of course not doubted,) met with in, and out of Parliament, was a sufficient vindication of the views persistently maintained by this paper, through all the fluctuations of the political thermometer.

The noble efforts of Mayor WOOD to relieve the thronged thoroughfares from the disgraceful publication of immorality to which they have for years been given up have turned the attention of humane people to the fact that, with all the asylums and refuges, and homes for the destitute that exist, we are not yet supplied as the enlightened humanity of our times requires that we should be. hese pitiable outcasts of which such

Under this head several journals yesterday published a paragraph relating to the printers employed on the Courier and Equirer, the errors in which require some notice. It is not true that "fourteen hands left on Friday night," nor is it true that the whole number of hands employed was "twenty-one."

It is not often that men can see a palpable case of historic justice. The punishments to nations are terrible and sure, but they are not always clear to the common mind.
