46-> A Touch of Larceny' at the Normandie
"A TOUCH OF LARCENY," the British-made import that was exposed at the Normandie Theatre yesterday via the good offices of Paramount, is no more melodramatic than its specific title indicates. As such, the comedy is a somewhat bland spoof that tends more toward genteel banter, faint whimsy and romance than to belly laughs and explosive ideas.Since all concerned appeared to be having a gay time, in a guardedly British manner, of course, there was no reason, from the evidence on screen, to assume that a viewer would not be able to react in the same fashion to these lightweight adventures.Romance, with a suspicion of chuckles, seems to have been the motive behind the script fashioned by Roger MacDougall, who will be remembered for "The Man in the White Suit," and Guy Hamilton, the director, and Ivan Foxwell, the producer. They have focused attention on Comdr. Max Easton, a World War II submarine hero and now technically an Admiralty hand but actually a diligent wolf most of the time. That is, until our man runs into a beauteous American widow, a decorative lass just as cute as her pursuer who, he discovers, is engaged to a rich pompous Foreign Office bloke. Undeterred, our intrepid campaigner devises a plan to make a quick fortune and thereby influence his lady fair.His blueprint calls for him allegedly to steal some papers, slip away to some deserted island off the Scottish coast and then, after the newspapers have branded him a traitor, return, prove them libelous and sue for big money. Naturally, there are hitches along the line, but our minor league Machiavelli makes the grade (without money unfortunately) with the object of his affections.Although he is not especially forceful or convincing as a Lochinvar, James Mason gives the role of the rakish commander the necessary light touches as he strews red herrings across the paths of the befuddled newspapers and the Navy. Vera Miles is properly pretty and receptive in a glacial sort of way. And George Sanders, portraying the jealous Foreign Office man is repeating once again, the characterization of the stiff, correct gentleman restrainedly weathering the buffets of outrageous fortune.Mr. MacDougall and his collaborators have devised civilized and, on occasion, mildly funny lines for their cast to speak. The cast, including Harry Andrews, as a strictly Navy captain, and Robert Flemyng, John Le Mesurier and Peter Barkworth, as other officers, pitches in to the proceedings in polished, casual style. These actors, as well as the principals, make this "Touch of Larceny" droll, if not devastating. The CastA TOUCH OF LARCENY; screen play by Roger MacDougall in collaboration with Ivan Foxwell and Guy Hamilton; based on the novel, "The Megstone Plot" by Andrew Garve; directed by Mr. Hamilton; produced by Mr. Foxwell and presented by Paramount.

63-> Steve Reeves in 'Last Days of Pompeii'
IN the latest Steve Reeves muscle-bulger, "The Last Days of Pompeii," the athletic actor pairs off with a good girl (Cristina Kauffman), while a bad one (Anne Marie Baumann) viciously turns Pompeii against the Christians. No sooner has Mr. Reeves jumped into an arena and saved the doomed Christians from an endless assortment of lions and gladiators than Vesuvius blows its stack.Some miniature sets crack and topple, the entire cast mills around in sooty confusion and Mr. Reeves, Miss Kauffman and the Christians safely paddle off the screen.Superficially, this United Artists release (put together by a co-production outfit of Rome, Madrid and Monaco—and looking it) is a typical Reeves showcase. The performers clatter in and out of fairly ornate period settings, mouthing dubbed English, and looking properly wicked or angelic. The color is splashy. And Mr. Reeves, the focal point, is superhuman on schedule, this time even unjawing a couple of crocodiles. One human mop-up, inside the temple of Isis, is as amusing as it is absurd.For a change, there's a bit of character development in the hero—Mr. Reeves is a burly, hard-bitten centurion before siding with the Christians. However, under Mario Bonnard's square-cut direction, the picture soon drops into a typical, old-fashioned rut. Even "Hercules Unchained" (last month) was livelier. For our money, "The Giant of Marathon" (the month before) remains the liveliest yet. How about another fast one, Mr. Reeves? Next month?

724-> Screen: British Satire:Peter Sellers Stars in 'I' m All Right, Jack'
OF all the unlikely subjects for successful satirizing on the screen—organized labor and management in modern industry — the British Boulting brothers, John and Roy, have picked it for their film "I'm All Right, Jack." And, what do you know!—they have run it into the brightest, liveliest comedy seen this year.Much like their "Private's Progress," which took a decidedly scandalous view of life in the British Army during World War II, this new satire at the Guild Theatre plays absolutely devastating hob with the obstructive tactics of trade unions—and with the intrigues of management, too.As a matter of fact, most of the characters in this delightfully sharp and rowdy farce are the same as were in "Private's Progress," only grown a little longer in the tooth. There's Ian Carmichael, the private, still a naïve and dizzy gentleman, seeking a place to dispose his peacetime talents and finding it as a laborer in a missile-making plant.There's Richard Attenborough, the Cockney schemer, now become a dapper man of affairs, and Dennis Price, the art-purloining major, now the head of the arms factory. These two arch and practiced connivers are joined in a clearly crooked plot, with Marne Maitland as a shifty-eyed Mohammedan, to mulct an unnamed Arab country on a big arms deal.And whom do you think these fine industrialists have as the labor-relations manager in their plant? None other than bucktoothed Terry-Thomas, the snarling major in that other film. He's the frenzied but foxy fellow who is now stuck with the patience-fraying job of dealing with the bland, lint-picking workers and spying on their time-wasting toils.However, someone new has been added—an outsider to complicate the lives of these memorable and mischievous war buddies and make their best-laid schemes gang agley. He is a stalwart and solemn-faced shop steward, a provokingly pompous, priggish type. And he is played so sensattionally by Peter Sellers that the whole film is made to jump and throb.Truly, it's hard to tell you what it is that Mr. Sellers does to make this figure of a union fanatic devastatingly significant and droll. Up to the point of his entrance, the comedy runs along in an innocent, charming fashion, poking fun at the British upper class and making a mockery of modern manufacturing and merchandising, somewhat in the manner of Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times."But when Mr. Sellers strides into the picture at the head of a shop committee, breathing fire and rattling off union specifications in an educated Cockney tone of voice, it is as if Mr. Chaplin's Great Dictator has come upon the scene. He is all efficiency, righteous indignation, monstrous arrogance and blank ineptitude. He is the most scathing thing that union labor has ever had represent it on the screen. He is also side-splittingly funny, as funny as a true stuffed shirt can be.We're not going to try to tell you how it all comes out; how Mr. Carmichael, with the best intentions, upsets the labor apple cart and precipitates a strike that puts a spoke in the conniving management's scheme and how this arouses the nation and compels a television panel show, in which the honest Mr. Carmichael exposes labor and management alike.All we'll say further is that John Boulting, Frank Harvey and Alan Hackney have written a script that is one of the liveliest in a long time, although loaded with cryptic British slang; that Mr. Boulting has directed it briskly; that Margaret Rutherford, Irene Handl, Liz Fraser and Victor Maddern play it finely, along with all those mentioned above—and that this is a picture that only members of the National Association of Manufacturers, the unions and a few million other Americans should be sure to see. The CastI'M ALL RIGHT, JACK; screen play by Frank Harvey, John Boulting and Alan Hackney; directed by Mr. Boulting; produced by Roy Boulting and distributed by Lion International Films, Inc.

YOU might not think a movie about a fellow who lends his rooms to the married executives of his office as a place for their secret love affairs would make a particularly funny or morally presentable show, especially when the young fellow uses the means to get advanced in his job.But under the clever supervision of Billy Wilder, who helped to write the script, then produced and directed "The Apartment," which opened at the Astor and the Plaza yesterday, the idea is run into a gleeful, tender and even sentimental film. And it is kept on the side of taste and humor by the grand performance of Jack Lemmon in the principal role.This Mr. Lemmon, whose stock went zooming last year with "Some Like It Hot," takes precedence as our top comedian by virtue of his work in this film. As the innocent and amiable young bachelor who methodically passes around the key of his modest brownstone-front apartment among the sultans of the place where he is employed, he beautifully maintains the appearance of a lamb among ravening wolves. He has the air of a good-natured hermit who calls Grand Central Station his home.His character does not like what he's doing. He would much prefer to stay in his bed on a rainy night when a sozzled sales executive telephones and demands the key. But he turns out, in line of duty, when the hint of a promotion is flung, and he continued to oblige, confidentially, until the inevitably romantic trouble brews.You can probably guess the reason. It is one of the elevator girls, for whom our fellow has worked up quite a fancy but whom he discovers is using the apartment with the head of personnel. Then he goes through an ordeal of worrying, especially after the girl has the rashness to choose the apartment for a suicide attempt on Christmas Eve. That makes for a sticky situation and a sharply ironic point of view on the perfidiousness of men with families playing around with the office girls.Even in this dismal incident, Mr. Wilder and his co-author on the script, I. A. L. Diamond, have managed to keep the action and the dialogue tumbling with wit. In the midst of a grim operation to get a pill-poisoned girl to come awake, they relieve the graveyard tension with trenchant and credible gags. And they bring the sentiment to focus with a wistful remark from the girl. "When you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara," she says.Mr. Wilder has done more than write the film. His direction is ingenious and sure, sparkled by brilliant little touches and kept to a tight, sardonic line. In addition to Mr. Lemmon's, there's a splendid performance by Shirley MacLaine, as the daffy girl who gets into a lot of trouble, and a good one by Fred MacMurray, as the wicked boss. Jack Kruschen makes a funny doctor-neighbor who mistakes Mr. Lemmon for a ladies' man, and Ray Walston and David Lewis are amusing (and slightly sordid) wolves.Adolph Deutsch has contributed a light, sentimental accompanying score, and Joseph LaShelle, the cinema-photoger, has made the whole thing look quite stylish and metropolitan on the black-and-white large screen. The CastTHE APARTMENT, from an original screen play by Billy Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond; directed and produced by Mr. Wilder for the Mirisch Company. A United Artists release.

891-> Screen: An Excess of Musical Riches: Song Without End,' Life of Liszt, Bows
FRANZ LISZT could scarcely have suspected, when he was creating such exquisite things as his brilliant operatic transcriptions, his Rhapsodies and his "Liebestraum," that he was helpfully putting together an album of Music to Make a Movie By. Yet that is the final impression one gets from "Song Without End," subtitled "The Story of Franz Liszt," which came to the Music Hall yesterday.After two hours of almost ceaseless harking to glorious and thrilling harmonies, virtuoso piano-playing, symphonic and choral renderings, presented as simulations of musical events in the life of Liszt, one comes away with the feeling of having had one's ears loaded with a rich melange or medley of calculated music that must have taken fifty years to compose.A little bit of everything reflective not only of the talent of Liszt but also of most of the great composers of his highly romantic age—Wagner, Paganini, Beethoven, Verdi, Chopin—artists whose work he respected, assisted, embellished and often played, is packed into this picture. And it is brilliantly and beautifully performed by Jorge Bolet in the piano pieces, by the Roger Wagner Chorale and by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles with Morris W. Stoloff on the podium. William Goetz, the producer, has given it the works.So elegant, indeed, is the music and so forcibly is it telescoped into scenes of great detail and color that mark biographical episodes that it seems, in the end, a tantalization. There is often not time enough for more than a fragment of a number before the film is hopping on to the next.It is thus an excess of riches, musical and visual, telescoped in order to pack as much in as possible, that makes for distraction in this film.Certainly the story of Franz Liszt has been trimmed down and packed in to a point where it finally presents the brilliant pianist and nineteenth-century favorite as little more than a cliché. He is an acknowledged genius (that's easily done in a film: everybody simply tells him he's a genius, especially other famous people with recognizable names) who troupes all over Europe, playing concerts, meeting composers, snubbing kings and sighing vastly over a married princess, while a discarded mistress cools her heels.A little bit of conflict is intruded in the way of indecision on Liszt's part as to whether he is cut out to be a composer or simply a pianist and whether he should write concert music or music for the church. But the resolution of this bit also results in a cliché. When he cannot have the princess (as wife), we are left to assume he gives the rest of his life to the church.These matters, which do bear faint resemblance to a part of the pattern of the life of Liszt, are brushed in so superficially that they carry little conviction or emotional strength, and the performances of the actors are, by necessity, more elaborate than they are deep. Dirk Bogarde, the English actor, is handsome and flamboyant as Liszt (and he uses his hands deftly at the piano) but he shows us little more than a troubled face.Likewise, a beautiful, regal but cold and alabaster facade representing the passionate princess is all we get from the new actress, Capucine. A somewhat more fluid, harassed mistress is temptingly sketched by Genevieve Page, and Lou Jacobi, Ivan Desny, Walter Rilla and Martita Hunt add average color to other roles.However, as we say, the music thunders; the settings and costumes are superb—such Viennese concert halls and palaces and lush romantic trappings have never been surpassed in a color film—and, indeed, the sheer posing of the actors by the late Charles Vidor and George Cukor is so suave that anyone moved by musical richness and pictorial splendor should go quite nutty over this film.On the stage at the Music Hall are the George Washington University Troubadours, a thirty-voice mixed chorus, featuring soloists Carolyn Knight and Jack Duval; comedian Gary Morton and the Corps de Ballet and Rockettes. The CastSONG WITHOUT END, screen play by Oscar Millard; directed by the late Charles Vidor and George Cukor; produced by William Goetz and released by Columbia Pictures. At the Radio City Music Hall.

1388-> Screen: 'The Entertainer':Olivier Stars in John Osborne's Story
AS an antidote to all the bromides about show people being lovely folk, amusing, courageous, soft-hearted and dedicated to spreading sunshine in the world, we suggest that you see "The Entertainer," Laurence Olivier's new film, based on the play by John Osborne, which opened at the Sutton yesterday. It pretty well shatters forever—or for the moment, at least—a fond belief.Acting a tinhorn song-and dance man in second-rate English music halls—a type for which lots of sweet nostalgia has been nicely concocted in recent years—Mr. Olivier, who might be regarded as the first gentleman of the British stage, brings forth a brilliant exposure of a cheap, sentimental theatrical fraud. And what he doesn't uncover about the people of the profession who live in "digs" and slosh through life in a sodden, aimless fashion, Brenda de Banzie and Roger Livesey do.Possibly Mr. Osborne had something deep and wise in mind when he wrote "The Entertainer," done here two years ago on the stage. Possibly he intended its ruthless and dismal expose of a fading figure in a fast-declining pastime to be reflective of the position of Britain today, and its trailing of the tattered glories of vaudeville to suggest a greater passing of prestige.There are certain intimations to support this. One son of its tarnished, middle-aged hoofer is a British soldier en route to the Suez to represent Queen and country when the drama begins. He is captured and his fate hangs in the balance all the while his old man is trying to save himself from ruin. Nothing comes of efforts to save him. Both are finished at the end.Also there's a cogent bit of business in which the hoofer's wife and mundane relatives try to get him to forsake his bleak profession and move to Canada. He resists this practical suggestion. Why? Because "Bass' draught ale is not obtainable in the former Dominion." It's a bit of implication, if you please.But for all that—or, rather, for whatever of that you are able to perceive—"The Entertainer" is a devastating picture of a hollow, hypocritical heel and of the pitiful people around him who are drowned in his grubby vanity. There is not a great deal of body to it. The fellow himself is too shallow and cheap to be worth very much consideration or extensive sympathy. And the members of his family—with one exception—are generally stupid, unstable and dull.Yet it works out to a fascinating picture, for one reason because of its superior illustrative performance and, for another, because of its striking mise en scène. Mr. Olivier is nothing short of brilliant as he runs the monotonous scale of turns and tricks of his shoddy entertainer, singing banal songs, pumping out endless off-stage wheezes and oozing absurd synthetic charm.It is only in the moments of his triumph over a pathetically silly stage-struck girl, appropriately and even compassionately performed by Shirley Ann Field, or of sudden self-torturing confidence with his daughter, whom Joan Plowright plays, that our man affectingly exposes the emptiness of his soul. Mr. Olivier is terrific in what is not one of his more terrific roles.Miss de Banzie is also excellent as his poor, confused, ineffectual wife, struggling to hang onto nothing and kid herself with an illusion of hope. Mr. Livesey does a fine job, mingling pathos with some pomposity, as a retired vaudevillian who succumbs to a fatal chance to return. Alan Bates is significantly flighty as a backstage son and Thora Hird gives a sharp impersonation of the vulgar mother of an ambitious girl.Director Tony Richardson has imaged the cheapness of a seaside music hall, of grubby "digs" and the midway surroundings in such a way as to have them all but smell. "The Entertainer" may not be an earth-shaking or even an important film. But it is entertaining. It reeks of show business. At least, it is always "on." The CastTHE ENTERTAINER; screen play by John Osborne and Nigel Kneale; adapted from the play by Mr. Osborne; directed by Tony Richardson; produced by Harry Saltzman; a Eryanston Film released here by Continental Distributing, Inc.
